# Configure pipelines to support work tracking

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

To support integration and traceability across Azure DevOps Services with pipelines, you can configure several options. You can report pipeline status, copy the syntax for status badges, and set up automatic linking of work items to builds and releases. 
 

## Supported pipeline and work tracking integration features 

Several features provide support for end-to-end traceability as user stories and features move through the development cycle. As with Azure Repos, you can link work items to pipeline objects with the following link types: *Build, Integrated in build*, and *Integrated in release*.  Note, that the *Integrated in release environment* link can only be created by enabling the **Report release status to Boards** option in Classic release pipelines. 

:::image type="content" source="media/pipelines-integration/concept-link-types-pipelines.png" alt-text="Conceptual image of link types that link work items to Azure Pipelines objects.":::

The following table summarizes the integration points between Azure Boards and Azure Pipelines. Options and configuration steps differ depending on whether you are configuring a YAML or Classic pipeline, and your Azure DevOps version.  Most options are supported for pipelines run against an Azure Repos Git repository unless otherwise noted.

## Automatically link work items to builds or releases 

By enabling automatic linking, you can track the builds or releases that have incorporated work without having to manually search through a large set of builds or releases. Each successful build associated with the work item automatically appears in the **Development** control of the work item form. Each release stage associated with the work item automatically appears in the **Deployment** control of the work item form.

Prior to choosing your integration options, you should set up the release stages as described in [Define your multi-stage continuous deployment (CD) pipeline](../../pipelines/release/define-multistage-release-process.md).

1. Open **Options>Integrations** for the release pipeline as describe in [Release integration options](#classic-release-options).

1. Check the **Report deployment status to Boards** checkbox. Map the **Deployment type** to each stage, or leave **Unmapped**. Select this option if you want to create links to all work items that represent associated changes to the source, when a release is complete. This option must be enabled in order for the work item form [**Deployment**](../../boards/work-items/work-item-deployments-control.md) control to work.

### Verify the integration 

To verify the integration is working, perform the following steps:  

1. Link one or more work items to a commit or pull request in Azure Repos Git repository. For details, see: 
	-  [Drive Git development from a work item](../../boards/backlogs/connect-work-items-to-git-dev-ops.md)  
	-  [Link to work items from other objects](../../organizations/notifications/add-links-to-work-items.md)

1.  Run the pipeline. 

1. Open one of the linked work items and view the [**Deployment**](../../boards/work-items/work-item-deployments-control.md) control control. As shown in the following image, the  **Deployment** control shows release information for two release stages those work items that have been linked to a Git commit or pull request for a release pipeline configured to integrate with Azure Boards.

::: moniker-end

*** 
 
### What work items are included in automatic linking? 

When developing your software, you can link work items when you create a branch, commit, or pull request. Or, you can initiate a branch, commit, or pull request from a work item, automatically linking these objects as described in [Drive Git development from a work item](../../boards/backlogs/connect-work-items-to-git-dev-ops.md). For example, here we create a new branch from the Cancel order form user story.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipelines-integration/create-branch-link-work-item.png" alt-text="Create branch dialog from work item form.":::

When automatically linking work items to builds, the following computations are made: 

- For a first-time build: 
	- Identify all work items linked to the branch, commits, and pull requests associated with the build.  

- For subsequent builds: 
	- Identify all work items associated with the current commit (C1) being built. 
	- Identify all work items associated with the commit (C2) of the last successful build of the same source branch. 
	- Identify all work items associated with the commits between C1 and C2 in the commit tree. 
 

<a id="create-work-item-on-failure" /> 

## Create work item on build failure (Classic) 

If a build pipeline fails, you can automatically create a work item to track getting the problem fixed. You can specify the work item type and set options to automatically assign it to the requestor or other fields. The requestor corresponds to the person that triggered the build. 
 

> [!TIP]   
> The option to **Create work item on failure** is only supported for Classic pipelines. To accomplish this with a YAML  pipeline, you can use a marketplace extension like [Create Bug on Release failure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmanBedi18.CreateBugTask) or you can [implement it yourself using Azure CLI or REST API calls](../customize-pipeline.md#create-work-item-on-failure). 
 

<a id="classic-options-integrations" /> 

1. Open pipeline build options as describe in [Build properties](#classic-build-properties).

2. Enable **Create work item on failure** and choose the type of work item to create. Optionally check the  **Assign to requestor** checkbox to set the **Assign To** field and add fields to set within the work item to create. 

	For example, here we choose the Bug work item type and specify the Priority and Tags fields and their values. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/pipelines-integration/create-work-item-failure-yaml.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Create work item on failure in build options.":::

3.	Save your pipeline.

To learn the reference name for a field, look it up from the [Work item field index](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md). For custom fields you add through an inherited process, Azure DevOps assigns a reference name based on friendly field name prefixed with *Custom.*. For example, you add a field named **DevOps Triage**, the reference name is Custom.DevOpsTriage. No spaces are allowed within the reference name.

## Report deployment status to the repository host (Classic)

When you code is stored in an Azure Repos Git repository, you can configure your release pipeline to display a badge on the Azure Repos pages. The badge indicates where the specific commit got deployed and whether the deployment is passing or failing. This option improves the traceability from code commit to deployment. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Integrations options for Classic pipelines, report deployment status to the repository host](media/pipelines-integration/classic-report-deployment-status.png)

The deployment status is displayed in the following sections of Azure Repos:

* **Files**: Indicates the status of the latest deployment for the selected branch.
* **Commits**: Indicates the deployment status for each commit (requires the continuous integration (CD) trigger to be enabled for your release).
* **Branches**: Indicates the status of the latest deployment for each branch.
 

If a commit gets deployed to multiple release pipelines, with multiple stages, each has an entry in the badge with status that's shown for each stage. By default, when you create a release pipeline, deployment status is posted for all stages. However, you can selectively choose the stages for which deployment status should be displayed in the status badge (for example, show only the production stage). Your team members can select the status badge to view the latest deployment status for each of the selected stages of the release pipelines.

## Report deployment status to Jira (Classic)

Include Jira issues in work items and create links to all issues on stage completion. Install Azure Pipelines for Jira app in JIRA Software cloud and add organization to create a connection.

:::image type="content" source="media/pipelines-integration/integration-options-classic-jira.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Integrations options for Classic pipelines, Report deployment status to Jira":::

To support integration with Jira issue tracking, install [Azure Pipelines integration with Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220515/azure-pipelines-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) and connect your Azure DevOps organizations with your Jira Software instance. You can connect multiple organizations with one instance and get data for all your teams and related projects. Learn more about setting up the integration in our documentation.To learn more about installation and setup, see [Integrate with Jira Issue tracking](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-jira/blob/master/tutorial.md).

## Configure GitHub comment triggers 

 Usually for security, teams may not want to automatically build pull requests. Instead, they want a team member to review the pull request and once it's deemed safe, trigger the build with a [pull request comment](../pipelines/repos/github.md?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true#comment-triggers). The following setting provides flexibility, keeps this option while still allowing automatic pull request builds _only_ for team members.
