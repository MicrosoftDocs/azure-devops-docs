# Build and test PHP apps

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Use Azure Pipelines continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to build, deploy, and test your PHP projects. 

Learn how to create a PHP pipeline, deploy a pipeline with a sample project to Azure App Service, and how to configure your environment. 

To learn more about Azure App Service, see [Create a PHP web app in Azure App Service](/azure/app-service/quickstart-php). 
## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [include](../includes/prerequisites.md)]
[!INCLUDE [include](../includes/azure-prerequisites.md)]

## Get the code

If you already have an app at GitHub that you want to deploy, you can create a pipeline for that code. But, if you're a new user, you might get a better start by using our sample code. In that case, fork the following repo at GitHub:

```
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/basic-php-composer
```

## Create a pipeline

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization and go to your project.

1. Select **PHP** in the **Configure** tab.

1. Examine your new pipeline. When you're ready, select **Save and run**.

   > ![Save and run button in a new YAML pipeline](media/save-and-run-button-new-yaml-pipeline.png)

1. You're prompted to commit a new _azure-pipelines.yml_ file to your repository. Select **Save and run** again.

   If you want to watch your pipeline in action, select the build job.

   You now have a working YAML pipeline (_azure-pipelines.yml_) in your repository that's ready for you to customize!

When you want to make changes to your pipeline, select your pipeline on the **Pipelines** page, and then **Edit** the _azure-pipelines.yml_ file.

Read further to learn some of the more common ways to customize your pipeline.

## Deploy to App Service

Use a pipeline to build a PHP web app and deploy to Azure App Service. Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.

You can use tasks to archive your files, publish a build artifact, and then use the [Azure Web App task](../tasks/deploy/azure-rm-web-app.md) to deploy to Azure App Service. 

This pipelines has two stages: Build and Deploy. In the Build stage, PHP 7.3 gets installed with composer. The app files are archived and uploaded into a package named `drop`. During the Deploy phase, the `drop` package gets deployed to Azure App Service as a web app.  

```yaml

trigger:
- main

variables:
  # Azure Resource Manager connection created during pipeline creation
  azureSubscription: 'subscription-id'
  # Web app name
  webAppName: 'web-app-name'
  # Agent VM image name
  vmImageName: 'ubuntu-latest'
  # Environment name
  environmentName: 'environment-name'
  # Root folder under which your composer.json file is available.
  rootFolder: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)

stages:
- stage: Build
  displayName: Build stage
  variables:
    phpVersion: '7.3'
  jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    pool:
      vmImage: $(vmImageName)
    steps:
    - script: |
        sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php$(phpVersion)
        sudo update-alternatives --set phar /usr/bin/phar$(phpVersion)
        sudo update-alternatives --set phpdbg /usr/bin/phpdbg$(phpVersion)
        sudo update-alternatives --set php-cgi /usr/bin/php-cgi$(phpVersion)
        sudo update-alternatives --set phar.phar /usr/bin/phar.phar$(phpVersion)
        php -version
      workingDirectory: $(rootFolder)
      displayName: 'Use PHP version $(phpVersion)'

    - script: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
      workingDirectory: $(rootFolder)
      displayName: 'Composer install'

    - task: ArchiveFiles@2
      displayName: 'Archive files'
      inputs:
        rootFolderOrFile: '$(rootFolder)'
        includeRootFolder: false
        archiveType: zip
        archiveFile: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/$(Build.BuildId).zip
        replaceExistingArchive: true

    - upload: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/$(Build.BuildId).zip
      displayName: 'Upload package'
      artifact: drop

- stage: Deploy
  displayName: 'Deploy Web App'
  dependsOn: Build
  condition: succeeded()
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeploymentJob
    pool:
      vmImage: $(vmImageName)
    environment: $(environmentName)
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - task: AzureWebApp@1
            displayName: 'Deploy Azure Web App'
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: $(azureSubscription)
              appName: $(webAppName)
              package: $(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/$(Build.BuildId).zip
```

## Configure build environment

Use Azure Pipelines to build your PHP projects without setting up infrastructure.

### Use a specific PHP version

 PHP is preinstalled on [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md), along with many common libraries per PHP version. You can use Linux, macOS, or Windows agents to run your builds. For more information and the exact versions of PHP that get preinstalled, see [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md#software).

On the Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agent, multiple versions of PHP are installed. A symlink at `/usr/bin/php` points to the currently set PHP version, so that when you run `php`, the set version executes. 

To use a PHP version other than the default, the symlink can be pointed to that version using the `update-alternatives` tool. Set the PHP version that you want by adding the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file and change the value of the **phpVersion** variable.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  phpVersion: 7.2

steps:
- script: |
    sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php$(phpVersion)
    sudo update-alternatives --set phar /usr/bin/phar$(phpVersion)
    sudo update-alternatives --set phpdbg /usr/bin/phpdbg$(phpVersion)
    sudo update-alternatives --set php-cgi /usr/bin/php-cgi$(phpVersion)
    sudo update-alternatives --set phar.phar /usr/bin/phar.phar$(phpVersion)
    php -version
  displayName: 'Use PHP version $(phpVersion)'
```

### Install dependencies

To use Composer to install dependencies, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

```yaml
- script: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist
  displayName: 'composer install'
```

### Test with phpunit

To run tests with phpunit, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

```yaml
- script: ./phpunit
  displayName: 'Run tests with phpunit'
```

### Retain the PHP app with the build record

To save the artifacts of this build with the build record, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.
Optionally, customize the value of **rootFolderOrFile** to alter what is included in the archive.

```yaml
- task: ArchiveFiles@2
  inputs:
    rootFolderOrFile: '$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)'
    includeRootFolder: false
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
```

### Using a custom composer location

If your composer.json is in a subfolder instead of the root directory, you can use the ```--working-dir``` argument to tell composer what directory to use. For example, if your composer.json is inside the subfolder ```pkgs```

```composer install --no-interaction --working-dir=pkgs```

You can also specify the absolute path, using the built-in system variables:

```composer install --no-interaction --working-dir='$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/pkgs'```
