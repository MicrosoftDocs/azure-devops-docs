# Build, test, and deploy Android apps

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This quickstart shows you how to set up a YAML pipeline in Azure Pipelines to automatically build, test, and deploy an Android app.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization and project where you have permission to create pipelines and deploy apps. To create a project, see [Create a project in Azure DevOps](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).
- A GitHub account.

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >During GitHub procedures, you might be prompted to create a [GitHub service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md#github-service-connection) or be redirected to GitHub to sign in, install Azure Pipelines, authorize Azure Pipelines, or authenticate to GitHub organizations. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the process. For more information, see [Access to GitHub repositories](../repos/github.md#access-to-github-repositories).

## Create and run the pipeline

Do the following tasks to set up a pipeline for a simple Android application.

1. To get the code for the sample app, fork the [Android sample app](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-android) repository to your GitHub account.
1. In your Azure DevOps project, select **Pipelines** > **New pipeline**, or **Create pipeline** if this pipeline is the first in the project.
1. Select **GitHub** as the location of your source code.
1. On the **Select a repository** screen, select your forked Android sample repository.
1. On the **Configure your pipeline** screen, select **Android**.
1. Azure Pipelines provides a starter pipeline based on the [Android](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-yaml/blob/master/templates/android.yml) template. Review the pipeline code.
1. Select **Save and run**.
1. Optionally, edit the **Commit message** and provide a description. Then select **Save and run** again to commit the *azure-pipelines.yml* file to your repository and start a build.

The build run page shows build details and progress. If you want to watch your pipeline in action, select **Job** on the lower part of the page.

You now have a working Android YAML pipeline, *azure-pipelines.yml*, in your repository that's ready to customize.

## Customize your pipeline

To make changes to your pipeline, select **Edit** on the pipeline page. The following sections describe some common ways to customize your Android pipeline.

### Configure Gradle

The starter YAML pipeline uses Gradle, a common open-source build tool for Android projects. For more information, see the [Gradle task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/gradle-v3).

In the example task, the `tasks` parameter builds the `assembleDebug` build type. You can adjust the `tasks` value for the build variants you want, such as `build`, `test`, and `assembleRelease`.

The example task also assumes that your `gradlew` file is at the root of the repository. If not, adjust the `workingDirectory` and `gradleWrapperFile` values accordingly.

The `workingDirectory` should be similar to the root of the repository, such as `AndroidApps/MyApp` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/AndroidApps/MyApp`. The `gradleWrapperFile` path should be similar to the root of the repository, such as `AndroidApps/MyApp/gradlew` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/AndroidApps/MyApp/gradlew`.

```yaml
- task: Gradle@3
  inputs:
    workingDirectory: ''
    gradleWrapperFile: 'gradlew'
    gradleOptions: '-Xmx3072m'
    publishJUnitResults: false
    testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
    tasks: 'assembleDebug'
```

For more information about using Gradle tasks, see [Using tasks](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html) in the Gradle documentation. For more information about build tasks, see [Build a debug APK](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/building-cmdline#DebugMode) and [Configure build variants](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants.html) in the Google Android development documentation.

### Sign and align the Android package (APK)

To run on a device instead of an emulator, the Android Application Package (APK) must be signed. Zipaligning reduces the RAM the application consumes. If your build doesn't already [sign and zipalign](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing) the APK, add the [Android Signing](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/android-signing-v3) task to the pipeline. For more information, see [Sign a mobile app](../apps/mobile/app-signing.md).

For security, store the `jarsignerKeystorePassword` and `jarsignerKeyPassword` in [secret variables](../process/variables.md#secret-variables) and use those variables in your pipeline.

```yaml
- task: AndroidSigning@2
  inputs:
    apkFiles: '**/*.apk'
    jarsign: true
    jarsignerKeystoreFile: 'pathToYourKeystoreFile'
    jarsignerKeystorePassword: '$(jarsignerKeystorePassword)'
    jarsignerKeystoreAlias: 'yourKeystoreAlias'
    jarsignerKeyPassword: '$(jarsignerKeyPassword)'
    zipalign: true
```

### Test on the Android emulator

To install and run the Android emulator, add the [Bash](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/bash-v3) task to your pipeline, and paste in the following code. The emulator starts as a background process and is available in later tasks. Arrange the emulator parameters to fit your testing environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using a [Microsoft-hosted agent](../agents/hosted.md), use the MacOS agent image with the Android emulator. Current Android emulators require hardware acceleration to start. Azure DevOps hosted Ubuntu agents do not support hardware acceleration. 

```yaml
- task: Bash@3
  inputs:
    targetType: 'inline'
    script: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash

      # Install AVD files
      echo "y" | $ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --install 'system-images;android-35;google_apis;x86_64'

      # Create emulator
      echo "y" | $ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager create avd -n xamarin_android_emulator -d "Nexus 10" -k 'system-images;android-35;google_apis;x86_64' --force

      echo "y" | $ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -list-avds

      echo "Starting emulator"

      # Start emulator in background
      nohup $ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd xamarin_android_emulator -no-snapshot -no-window -no-audio -no-boot-anim -accel on > /dev/null 2>&1 &
      # Fixed quoting around "\r"
      $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb wait-for-device shell 'while [[ -z $(getprop sys.boot_completed | tr -d "\r") ]]; do sleep 1; done; input keyevent 82'

      $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb devices

      echo "Emulator started"
```

### Test on Azure-hosted devices

To test your app in a hosted lab of Android devices in the Visual Studio App Center, add the [App Center Test](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/app-center-test-v1) task to your pipeline.

This task requires an [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) free trial account, which must be converted to paid after 30 days to continue to use the test lab. [Sign up for an App Center account](https://appcenter.ms/signup?utm_source=DevOps&utm_medium=Azure&utm_campaign=docs) before you use this task.

> [!WARNING]
> Visual Studio App Center is scheduled for retirement on March 31, 2025. [Learn more about support timelines and recommended alternatives.](https://aka.ms/appcenter/retire)

[Sign up with App Center](https://appcenter.ms/signup?utm_source=DevOps&utm_medium=Azure&utm_campaign=docs) first.

The following example runs an App Center test suite. The task uses a [service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md#visual-studio-app-center-service-connection) that you must set up.

For the complete task syntax and reference, see [App Center Test task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/app-center-test-v1). For more information, see [Using Azure DevOps for UI Testing](/appcenter/test-cloud/vsts-plugin).

```yml
- task: AppCenterTest@1
  inputs:
    appFile: path/myapp.ipa
    artifactsDirectory: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/AppCenterTest'
    frameworkOption: 'appium'
    appiumBuildDirectory: test/upload
    serverEndpoint: 'My App Center service connection'
    appSlug: username/appIdentifier
    devices: 'devicelist'
```

### Keep artifacts with the build record

To store your APK file with the build record or test and deploy it in subsequent pipelines, add the [Copy Files](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) and [Publish Build Artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1) tasks to your pipeline. For more information, see [Publish and download pipeline artifacts](../artifacts/pipeline-artifacts.md).

```yaml
- task: CopyFiles@2
  inputs:
    contents: '**/*.apk'
    targetFolder: '$(build.artifactStagingDirectory)'
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathToPublish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
    artifactName: MyBuildOutputs
```

### Deploy to App Center

To distribute an app to a group of testers or beta users, or promote the app to Intune or Google Play, add the [App Center Distribute](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/app-center-distribute-v3) task. The task requires a free [App Center](https://appcenter.ms) account that remains free of charge.

The following example distributes an app to users. For the complete task syntax and reference, see [App Center Distribute](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/app-center-distribute-v3). For more information, see [Deploy Azure DevOps Builds with App Center](/appcenter/distribution/vsts-deploy).

```yml
- task: AppCenterDistribute@3
  inputs:
    serverEndpoint: 'AppCenter'
    appSlug: '$(APP_CENTER_SLUG)'
    appFile: '$(APP_FILE)' # Relative path from the repo root to the APK file you want to publish
    symbolsOption: 'Android'
    releaseNotesOption: 'input'
    releaseNotesInput: 'Here are the release notes for this version.'
    destinationType: 'groups'
```

### Install the Google Play extension and deploy to Google Play

To automate interaction with Google Play, install the [Google Play extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play) and then use the following tasks. By default, these tasks authenticate to Google Play by using a [service connection](..//library/service-endpoints.md) that you must configure.

#### Release

To release a new Android app version to the Google Play store, add the [Google Play Release](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play#user-content-google-play---release) task to your pipeline.

```yaml
- task: GooglePlayRelease@4
  inputs:
    apkFile: '**/*.apk'
    serviceEndpoint: 'yourGooglePlayServiceConnectionName'
    track: 'internal'
```

#### Promote

To promote a previously released Android application update from one track to another, such as `alpha` &rarr; `beta`, add the [Google Play Promote](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play#user-content-google-play---promote) task to your pipeline.

```yaml
- task: GooglePlayPromote@3
  inputs:
    packageName: 'com.yourCompany.appPackageName'
    serviceEndpoint: 'yourGooglePlayServiceConnectionName'
    sourceTrack: 'internal'
    destinationTrack: 'alpha'
```

#### Increase rollout

To increase the rollout percentage of an application that was previously released to the `rollout` track, add the [Google Play Increase Rollout](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play#user-content-google-play---increase-rollout) task to your pipeline.

```yaml
- task: GooglePlayIncreaseRollout@2
  inputs:
    packageName: 'com.yourCompany.appPackageName'
    serviceEndpoint: 'yourGooglePlayServiceConnectionName'
    userFraction: '0.5' # 0.0 to 1.0 (0% to 100%)
```

#### Update status

To update the rollout status for an application that was previously released to the `rollout` track, add the [Google Play Status Update](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play#user-content-google-play---status-update) task to your pipeline.

```yaml
  - task: GooglePlayStatusUpdate@2
    inputs:
      authType: ServiceEndpoint
      packageName: 'com.yourCompany.appPackageName'
      serviceEndpoint: 'yourGooglePlayServiceConnectionName'
      status: 'inProgress' # draft | inProgress | halted | completed
```

## Create an app bundle

You can build and sign an app bundle with an inline script and a secure file.

1. Download your keystore and store it as a [secure file](../library/secure-files.md) in the Azure Pipelines library.

1. Create variables for `keystore.password`, `key.alias`, and `key.password` in a [variable group](../library/variable-groups.md).

In your YAML pipeline:

1. Add the [Download Secure File](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/download-secure-file-v1) task to download the *app.keystore* secure file.

   ```yaml
   - task: DownloadSecureFile@1
     name: keyStore
     displayName: "Download keystore from secure files"
     inputs:
       secureFile: app.keystore
   ```

1. Use the [Bash](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/bash-v3) task with a Bash script to build and sign the app bundle.

   ```yaml
   - task: Bash@3
     displayName: "Build and sign App Bundle"
     inputs:
       targetType: "inline"
       script: |
         msbuild -restore $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/myAndroidApp/*.csproj -t:SignAndroidPackage -p:AndroidPackageFormat=aab -p:Configuration=$(buildConfiguration) -p:AndroidKeyStore=True -p:AndroidSigningKeyStore=$(keyStore.secureFilePath) -p:AndroidSigningStorePass=$(keystore.password) -p:AndroidSigningKeyAlias=$(key.alias) -p:AndroidSigningKeyPass=$(key.password)
   ```

1. Use the [Copy Files](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) task to copy the app bundle.

   ```yaml
   - task: CopyFiles@2
     displayName: 'Copy deliverables'
     inputs:
       SourceFolder: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/myAndroidApp/bin/$(buildConfiguration)'
       Contents: '*.aab'
       TargetFolder: 'drop'
   ```

From here, you can either create and save an artifact with the [Publish Build Artifact](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1) task or use the [Google Play extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsclient.google-play) to publish the app bundle.
