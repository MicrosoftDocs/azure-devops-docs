# Build Java apps

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2017-rtm](../_shared/version-tfs-2017-rtm.md)]

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
> [!NOTE]
> 
> This guidance uses YAML-based pipelines available in Azure Pipelines. For TFS, use tasks that correspond to those used in the YAML below.
::: moniker-end

This guidance explains how to automatically build Java projects. (If you're working on an Android project, see [Build, test, and deploy Android apps](android.md).)

## Create your first pipeline

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> Are you new to Azure Pipelines? If so, then we recommend you try this section to create before moving on to other sections.

::: moniker-end

### Get the code

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/get-code-before-sample-repo.md)]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

Import this repo into your Git repo in Azure DevOps Server 2019:

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"

Import this repo into your Git repo in TFS:

::: moniker-end

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-java
```

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

### Sign in to Azure Pipelines

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/sign-in-azure-pipelines.md)]

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/create-project.md)]

::: moniker-end

### Create the pipeline

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/create-pipeline-before-template-selected.md)]

> When the **Configure** tab appears, select **Maven**.

1. When your new pipeline appears, take a look at the YAML to see what it does. When you're ready, select **Save and run**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Save and run button in a new YAML pipeline](_img/save-and-run-button-new-yaml-pipeline.png)

2. You're prompted to commit a new _azure-pipelines.yml_ file to your repository. After you're happy with the message, select **Save and run** again.

   If you want to watch your pipeline in action, select the build job.

   > You just created and ran a pipeline that we automatically created for you, because your code appeared to be a good match for the [Maven](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-yaml/blob/master/templates/maven.yml) template.

   You now have a working YAML pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`) in your repository that's ready for you to customize!

3. When you're ready to make changes to your pipeline, select it in the **Pipelines** page, and then **Edit** the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

4. See the sections below to learn some of the more common ways to customize your pipeline.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

1. Create a pipeline (if you don't know how, see [Create your first pipeline](../create-first-pipeline.md), and for the template select **Maven**. This template automatically adds the tasks you need to build the code in the sample repository.

2. Save the pipeline and queue a build. When the **Build #nnnnnnnn.n has been queued** message appears, select the number link to see your pipeline in action.

   You now have a working pipeline that's ready for you to customize!

3. When you're ready to make changes to your pipeline, **Edit** it.

4. See the sections below to learn some of the more common ways to customize your pipeline.

## Build environment

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can use Azure Pipelines to build Java apps without needing to set up any infrastructure of your own. You can build on Windows, Linux, or MacOS images. The Microsoft-hosted agents in Azure Pipelines have modern JDKs and other tools for Java pre-installed. To know which versions of Java are installed, see [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md).

Update the following snippet in your `azure-pipelines.yml` file to select the appropriate image.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04' # other options: 'macOS-10.13', 'vs2017-win2016'
```

See [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) for a complete list of images.

As an alternative to using Microsoft-hosted agents, you can set up [self-hosted agents](../agents/agents.md#install) with Java installed. You can also use self-hosted agents to save additional time if you have a large repository or you run incremental builds.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

Your builds run on a [self-hosted agent](../agents/agents.md#install). Make sure that you have Java installed on the agent.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

## Build your code

### Maven

To build with Maven, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Change values, such as the path to your `pom.xml` file, to match your project configuration. See the [Maven](../tasks/build/maven.md) task for more about these options.

```yaml
steps:
- task: Maven@3
  inputs:
    mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
    mavenOptions: '-Xmx3072m'
    javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
    jdkVersionOption: '1.11'
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'
    publishJUnitResults: false
    testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
    goals: 'package'
```

#### Customize the build path

Adjust the `mavenPomFile` value if your `pom.xml` file isn't in the root of the repository. The file path value should be relative to the root of the repository, such as `IdentityService/pom.xml` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/IdentityService/pom.xml`.

#### Customize Maven goals

Set the **goals** value to a space-separated list of goals for Maven to execute, such as `clean package`.

For details about common Java phases and goals, see [Apache's Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).

### Gradle

To build with Gradle, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. See the [Gradle](../tasks/build/gradle.md) task for more about these options.

```yaml
steps:
- task: Gradle@2
  inputs:
    workingDirectory: ''
    gradleWrapperFile: 'gradlew'
    gradleOptions: '-Xmx3072m'
    javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
    jdkVersionOption: '1.11'
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'
    publishJUnitResults: false
    testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
    tasks: 'build'
```

#### Choose the version of Gradle

The version of Gradle installed on the agent machine will be used unless your repository's `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file has a `distributionUrl` property that specifies a different Gradle version to download and use during the build.

#### Adjust the build path

Adjust the `workingDirectory` value if your `gradlew` file isn't in the root of the repository.
The directory value should be relative to the root of the repository, such as `IdentityService` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/IdentityService`.

Adjust the `gradleWrapperFile` value if your `gradlew` file isn't in the root of the repository. The file path value should be relative to the root of the repository, such as `IdentityService/gradlew` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/IdentityService/gradlew`.

#### Adjust Gradle tasks

Adjust the **tasks** value for the tasks that Gradle should execute, such as `build` or `check`.

For details about common Java Plugin tasks for Gradle, see [Gradle's documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_tasks).

### Ant

To build with Ant, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Change values, such as the path to your `build.xml` file, to match your project configuration. See the [Ant](../tasks/build/ant.md) task for more about these options.

```yaml
steps:
- task: Ant@1
  inputs:
    workingDirectory: ''
    buildFile: 'build.xml'
    javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
    jdkVersionOption: '1.11'
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'
    publishJUnitResults: false
    testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
```

### Script

To build with a command line or script, add one of the following snippets to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

#### Inline script

The `script:` step runs an inline script using Bash on Linux and macOS and Command Prompt on Windows. For details, see the [Bash](../tasks/utility/bash.md) or [Command line](../tasks/utility/powershell.md) task.

```yaml
steps:
- script: |
    echo Starting the build
    mvn package
  displayName: 'Build with Maven'
```

#### Script file

This snippet runs a script file that is in your repository. For details, see the [Shell Script](../tasks/utility/shell-script.md), [Batch script](../tasks/utility/batch-script.md), or [PowerShell](../tasks/utility/powershell.md) task.

```YAML
steps:
- task: ShellScript@2
  inputs:
    scriptPath: 'build.sh'
```

## Next Steps

After you've built and tested your app, you can upload the build output to Azure Pipelines or TFS, create and publish a Maven package, 
or package the build output into a .war/jar file to be deployed to a web application.

Next we recommend that you learn more about creating a CI/CD pipeline for the deployment target you choose:

* [Build and deploy to a Java web app](java-webapp.md)
* [Build and deploy Java to Azure Functions](java-function.md)
* [Build and deploy Java to Azure Kubernetes service](kubernetes/aks-template.md)
