> If you're using your own code, then instead of a new pipeline automatically appearing for you to review a couple of different things might happen.
>
> * If your repository contains code that's different in nature than our sample, then a different azure-pipelines.yml file might be created for you.
> 
> * If your repository already contains an `azure-pipelines.yml` file, then that file will be used, and you'll see a **Run** button. Select it to start a build.
>
> * If your repository has different kinds of code in it, then you might be shown a list of options from which you can choose. You'll see a **Save and run** button instead of **Run**. Select **Save and run**, then select **Commit directly to the master branch**, and then choose **Save and run** again.
