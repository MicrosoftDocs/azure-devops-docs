## Create your first pipeline

Are you new to Azure Pipelines? If so, then we recommend you try the following section first.

[!INCLUDE [include](../includes/dotnet-setup.md)]

### Create a DevOps project

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

[!INCLUDE [include](includes/sign-in-azure-pipelines.md)]

[!INCLUDE [include](includes/create-project.md)]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

1. In a browser window, sign in to your Azure DevOps Server and select your collection.
1. Select **New project**.
1. Enter a project name.
1. Optionally, enter a description.
1. Select **Create**.

::: moniker-end

### Set up your build environment

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops-2022"

Your builds run on [self-hosted agents](../agents/agents.md#install). Make sure that you have the necessary version of the .NET Core SDK and runtime installed on the agents. You can build your .NET Core projects by using the .NET Core SDK and runtime on [Windows](../agents/windows-agent.md), [Linux](../agents/linux-agent.md), [macOS](../agents/osx-agent.md) and [Docker](../agents/docker.md). 

You can install a specific version of .NET SDK by adding the UseDotNet@2 task in your pipeline YAML file or add the task to your pipeline using the classic editor.

Example YAML snippet:

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    version: '8.x'
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

Your builds run on [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md).  You can build your .NET Core projects by using the .NET Core SDK and runtime on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Alternatively, you can use a [self-hosted agent](../agents/agents.md). With a self-hosted agent, you can use preview or private SDKs not officially supported by Azure DevOps Services and run incremental builds.

You now have a working pipeline that's ready for you to customize! Read further to learn some of the common ways to customize your pipeline.


## Build environment

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops-2022"

Azure Pipelines uses self-hosted agents to build your .NET Core projects. Make sure that you have the necessary version of the .NET Core SDK and runtime installed on the agents. You can build your .NET Core projects by using the .NET Core SDK and runtime on [Windows](../agents/windows-agent.md), [Linux](../agents/linux-agent.md), [macOS](../agents/osx-agent.md) and [Docker](../agents/docker.md).

For example, to select a pool and agent capabilities in the pipeline YAML file:  

You can select the agent pool and agent for your build job.  Agents are specified based on their capabilities.

```yml
pool:
  name: myPrivateAgents
  demands:
  - agent.os -equals Darwin
  - anotherCapability -equals somethingElse
```

You can install a specific version of .NET SDK by adding the UseDotNet@2 task in your pipeline.  Keep in mind that for agents that run on physical systems, installing SDKs and tools through your pipeline alters the build environment on the agent's host.

To install a newer SDK, set `performMultiLevelLookup` to `true` in the following snippet: 

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: 'Install .NET Core SDK'
  inputs:
    version: 8.x
    performMultiLevelLookup: true
    includePreviewVersions: true # Required for preview versions
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

You can use Azure Pipelines to build your .NET Core projects on Windows, Linux, or macOS without the need to set up infrastructure. 

For example, Ubuntu is set here in the pipeline YAML file.  

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest' 
```

See [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) for a complete list of images and further configuration examples.

The [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) in Azure Pipelines include several preinstalled versions of supported .NET Core SDKs. Microsoft-hosted agents don't include some of the older versions of the .NET Core SDK. They also don't typically include prerelease versions. If you need these versions of the SDK on Microsoft-hosted agents, install them using the [UseDotNet@2](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2) task.

For example, to install 5.0.x SDK, add the following snippet:

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  inputs:
    version: '5.x'
```

Windows agents already include a .NET Core runtime. To install a newer SDK, set `performMultiLevelLookup` to `true` in the following snippet: 

```yaml
steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: 'Install .NET Core SDK'
  inputs:
    version: 8.x
    performMultiLevelLookup: true
    includePreviewVersions: true # Required for preview versions
```

> [!TIP]
> To save the cost of running the tool installer, you can set up a [Linux](../agents/linux-agent.md), [macOS](../agents/osx-agent.md), or [Windows](../agents/windows-agent.md) [self-hosted agent](../agents/agents.md#install).
> You can also use self-hosted agents to save additional time if you have a large repository or you run incremental builds. A self-hosted agent can also help you in using the preview or private SDKs that aren't officially supported by Azure DevOps or are only available on your corporate or on-premises environments.

## Restore dependencies

NuGet is a popular way to depend on code that you don't build. You can download NuGet packages and project-specific tools that are specified in the project file by running the `dotnet restore` command either through the **.NET Core** task or directly in a script in your pipeline.  For more information, see  [.NET Core task (DotNetCoreCLI@2)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/dotnet-core-cli-v2).

You can download NuGet packages from Azure Artifacts, NuGet.org, or some other external or internal NuGet repository. The **.NET Core** task is especially useful to restore packages from authenticated NuGet feeds. If your feed is in the same project as your pipeline, you don't need to authenticate. 

This pipeline uses an Azure Artifact feed for `dotnet restore` in the **DotNetCoreCLI@2** task. 

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: 'Install .NET Core SDK'
  inputs:
    version: 8.x
    performMultiLevelLookup: true
    includePreviewVersions: true # Required for preview versions

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'restore'
    feedsToUse: 'select'
    vstsFeed: 'my-vsts-feed' # A series of numbers and letters

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: 'build'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
  displayName: 'dotnet build $(buildConfiguration)'
```

The `dotnet restore` command uses the `NuGet.exe` packaged with the .NET Core SDK and can only restore packages specified in the .NET Core project `.csproj` files. 

If you also have a Microsoft .NET Framework project in your solution or use `package.json` to specify your dependencies, use the **NuGet** task to restore those dependencies.

```yaml
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: 'restore'
    restoreSolution: '**/*.sln'
    feedsToUse: 'select'
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Ubuntu 24.04 or higher, you must use the `NuGetAuthenticate` task with the .NET CLI instead of the `NuGetCommand@2` task. See [Support for newer Ubuntu hosted images](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2#support-for-newer-ubuntu-hosted-images) for more details.

In .NET Core SDK version 2.0 and newer, packages are restored automatically when running commands such as `dotnet build`. However, you would still need to use the **.NET Core** task to restore packages if you use an authenticated feed.

Your builds can fail because of connection issues when you restore packages from NuGet.org. You can use Azure Artifacts with [upstream sources](../../artifacts/concepts/upstream-sources.md) to cache the packages. The credentials of the pipeline are automatically used when it connects to Azure Artifacts. These credentials are typically derived from the **Project Collection Build Service** account. To learn more about using Azure Artifacts to cache your NuGet packages, see [Connect to Azure Artifact feeds](../../artifacts/nuget/nuget-exe.md).

To specify a NuGet repository, put the URL in a `NuGet.config` file in your repository. If your feed is authenticated, manage its credentials by creating a NuGet service connection in the **Services** tab under **Project Settings**.

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

When you use Microsoft-hosted agents, you get a new machine every time you run a build, which restores the packages with each run. Restoration can take a significant amount of time. To mitigate, you can either use Azure Artifacts or a self-hosted agent with the benefit of using the package cache.

::: moniker-end

For more information about NuGet service connections, see [publish to NuGet feeds](../artifacts/nuget.md).

### Restore packages from an external feed

Do the following to restore packages from an external feed.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml-editor)

You can add the restore command to your pipeline using the YAML pipeline editor by directly inserting the following snippet into your `azure-pipelines.yml` file or using the task assistant to add the **.NET Core** task.

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: Restore
  inputs:
    command: restore
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
    feedsToUse: config
    nugetConfigPath: NuGet.config    # Relative to root of the repository
    externalFeedCredentials: <Name of the NuGet service connection>
```

1. Drag the task to position it in the correct task sequence in the pipeline.
1. From the **Save and queue** dropdown list, select an option to save your changes.

---

### Add a .NET Core CLI command using a script

You can add .NET Core CLI commands as a `script` in your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

Example:

```yml

steps:
# ...
- script: dotnet test <test-project> 
```

### Install a tool

To install a .NET Core global tool like [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) in your build running on Windows, take the following steps:

1. Add the **.NET Core** task and set the following properties:
   * **Command**: custom.
     * **Path to projects**: _leave empty_.
   * **Custom command**: tool.
   * **Arguments**: `install -g dotnetsay`.
1. To run the tool, add a **Command Line** and set the following properties:
   * **Script:** `dotnetsay`.

## Run your tests

When you have test projects in your repository, you can use the **.NET Core** task to run unit tests by using testing frameworks like MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit. The test project must reference [Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK) version 15.8.0 or higher.
Test results are automatically published to the service. These results are available to you in the build summary and can be used for troubleshooting failed tests and test-timing analysis.

You can add a test task to your pipeline using the **DotNetCoreCLI@2** task or add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after other tasks such as building
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
```

When using the **.NET Core** task editor, set **Command** to **test** and **Path to projects** should refer to the test projects in your solution.

Alternatively, you can run the `dotnet test` command with a specific logger and then use the **Publish Test Results** task:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after your tests have run
- script: dotnet test <test-project> --logger trx
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
  inputs:
    testRunner: VSTest
    testResultsFiles: '**/*.trx'
```

## Collect code coverage 

When you're building on the Windows platform, code coverage metrics can be collected by using the built-in coverage data collector. The test project must reference [Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK) version 15.8.0 or higher. 

When you use the **.NET Core** task to run tests, coverage data is automatically published to the server. The ``.coverage`` file can be downloaded from the build summary for viewing in Visual Studio.

Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after other tasks such as building
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration) --collect "Code Coverage"'
```

To add the **.NET Core** task through the task editor:

1. Add the .NET Core task to your build job and set the following properties:

    1. **Command**: test.
    1. **Path to projects**: _Should refer to the test projects in your solution_.
    1. **Arguments**: `--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --collect "Code Coverage"`.

1. Ensure that the **Publish test results** option remains selected.

If you choose to run the `dotnet test` command, specify the test results logger and coverage options. Then use the [Publish Test Results](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-test-results-v2) task:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after your tests have run
- script: dotnet test <test-project> --logger trx --collect "Code Coverage"
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  inputs:
    testRunner: VSTest
    testResultsFiles: '**/*.trx'

### Collect code coverage metrics with Coverlet

If you're building on Linux or macOS, you can use [Coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet) or a similar tool to collect code coverage metrics.

You can publish code coverage results to the server with the [Publish Code Coverage Results (PublishCodeCoverageResults@2](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-code-coverage-results-v2) task. The coverage tool must be configured to generate results in Cobertura or JaCoCo coverage format.

To run tests and publish code coverage with Coverlet, do the following tasks:

* Add a reference to the  `coverlet.collector` NuGet package.
* Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

  ```yaml
  - task: UseDotNet@2
    inputs:
      version: '8.x'
      includePreviewVersions: true # Required for preview versions
    
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: 'dotnet build'
    inputs:
      command: 'build'
      configuration: $(buildConfiguration)
    
  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: 'dotnet test'
    inputs:
      command: 'test'
      arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration) --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" -- DataCollectionRunSettings.DataCollectors.DataCollector.Configuration.Format=cobertura'
      publishTestResults: true
      projects: 'MyTestLibrary' # update with your test project directory
    
  - task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@2
    displayName: 'Publish code coverage report'
    inputs:
      codeCoverageTool: 'Cobertura'
      summaryFileLocation: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/**/coverage.cobertura.xml'
  ```

## Package and deliver your code

You can publish your build artifacts by:

* Publishing to Azure Pipelines.
* Publishing packages to Azure Artifacts.
* Creating a NuGet package and publish to your NuGet feed.
* Creating a *.zip* archive to deploy your web app.

### Publish artifacts to Azure Pipelines

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

To publish the output of your .NET **build** to your pipeline, do the following tasks: 

* Run `dotnet publish --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` on the .NET CLI or add the **DotNetCoreCLI@2** task with the publish command.
* Publish the artifact by using the [Publish Pipeline Artifact](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-pipeline-artifact-v1) task.

Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
steps:

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: True
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True

# this code takes all the files in $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) and uploads them as an artifact of your build.
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)' 
    artifactName: 'myWebsite'

```

> [!NOTE]
> The **DotNetCoreCLI@2** task has a `publishWebProjects` input that is set to **true** by default. This task publishes _all_ web projects in your repo by default. You can find more help and information in the [open source task on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks).

To copy more files to the build directory before publishing, use the [Copy Files (CopyFile@2)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) task.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

To publish the output of your .NET **build** to your pipeline, do the following tasks: 

* Run `dotnet publish --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` on CLI or add the **DotNetCoreCLI@2** task with the publish command.
* Publish the artifact by using the [Publish build artifact (PublishBuildArtifacts@1)](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-pipeline-artifact-v1)  task.

Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file to publish your build artifacts as a .zip file:

```yaml
steps:

- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: True
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True

# this code takes all the files in $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory) and uploads them as an artifact of your build.
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    ArtifactName: 'drop'

```

For more information, see [Publish and download build artifacts](../artifacts/build-artifacts.md).

### Publish to a NuGet feed

To create a NuGet package and publish it to your NuGet feed, add the following snippet:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this near the end of your pipeline in most cases
- script: dotnet pack /p:PackageVersion=$(version)  # define version variable elsewhere in your pipeline
- task: NuGetAuthenticate@1
  inputs:
    nuGetServiceConnections: '<Name of the NuGet service connection>'
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: push
    nuGetFeedType: external
    publishFeedCredentials: '<Name of the NuGet service connection>'
    versioningScheme: byEnvVar
    versionEnvVar: version
```

> [!NOTE]
> The NuGetAuthenticate@1 task doesn't support NuGet API key authentication. If you're using a NuGet API key, use the NuGetCommand@2 task with the `command` input set to `push` with the *--api-key* argument. For example, `dotnet nuget push --api-key $(NuGetApiKey)`.

For more information about versioning and publishing NuGet packages, see [publish to NuGet feeds](../artifacts/nuget.md).  

### Publish a NuGet package to Azure Artifacts

You can publish your NuGet packages to your Azure Artifacts feed by using the [NuGetCommand@2](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2) to push to your Azure Artifact feed.  For example, see [Publish NuGet packages with Azure Pipelines](../artifacts/nuget.md).

### Deploy a web app

To create a .zip file archive that's ready to publish to a web app, add the following snippet:

```yaml
steps:
# ...
# do this after you've built your app, near the end of your pipeline in most cases
# for example, you do this before you deploy to an Azure web app on Windows
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: True
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True
```

To publish this archive to a web app, see [Azure Web Apps deployment](../targets/webapp.md).  

### Build an image and push to container registry

You can also [build an image](containers/build-image.md) for your app and [push it to a container registry](containers/push-image.md).

### Publish symbols

You can use the **PublishSymbols@2** task to publish symbols to an Azure Artifacts symbol server or a file share.

For example, to publish symbols to a file share, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- task: PublishSymbols@2
  inputs:
    SymbolsFolder: '$(Build.SourcesDirectory)'
    SearchPattern: '**/bin/**/*.pdb'
    IndexSources: true
    PublishSymbols: true
    SymbolServerType: 'FileShare' 
    SymbolsPath: '\\server\shareName'
```


When using the classic editor, select **Index sources publish symbols** from the task catalog to add to your pipeline.

For more information, see [Publish symbols](../artifacts/symbols.md).

## Troubleshoot

If you can build your project on your development machine, but you're having trouble building it on Azure Pipelines, explore the following potential causes and corrective actions:

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

* Prerelease versions of the .NET Core SDK aren't installed on Microsoft-hosted agents. After a new version of the .NET Core SDK is released, it can take a few weeks to roll out to all the Azure Pipelines data centers. You don't have to wait for this rollout to complete. You can use the [Use .NET Core](#build-environment) task to install the .NET Core SDK version you want on Microsoft-hosted agents.  

::: moniker-end

* Check the .NET Core SDK versions and runtime on your development machine and make sure they match the agent. You can include a command-line script `dotnet --version` in your pipeline to print the version of the .NET Core SDK. Either use the [.NET Core Tool Installer](#build-environment) to deploy the same version on the agent, or update your projects and development machine to the newer version of the .NET Core SDK.

* You might be using some logic in the Visual Studio IDE that isn't encoded in your pipeline. 
Azure Pipelines runs each of the commands you specify in the tasks one after the other in a new process. 
Examine the logs from the pipelines build to see the exact commands that ran as part of the build. 
Repeat the same commands in the same order on your development machine to locate the problem.

* If you have a mixed solution that includes some .NET Core projects and some .NET Framework projects, 
  you should also use the **NuGet** task to restore packages specified in `packages.config` files.
Add the **MSBuild** or **Visual Studio Build** task to build the .NET Framework projects.

* Your builds might fail intermittently while restoring packages: either NuGet.org is having issues or there are networking problems between the Azure data center and NuGet.org. You can explore whether using Azure Artifacts with NuGet.org as an upstream source improves the reliability of your builds, as it's not in our control.

* Occasionally, a when new version of the .NET Core SDK or Visual Studio is rolled out, your build might break. For example, a newer version or feature of the NuGet tool is shipped with the SDK could break your build. To isolate this issue, use the **.NET Core Tool Installer** task to specify the version of the .NET Core SDK used in your build.
