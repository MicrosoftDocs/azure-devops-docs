# Create your first pipeline

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2017-rtm](_shared/version-tfs-2017-rtm.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

This is a step-by-step guide to using Azure Pipelines to build a GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/prerequisites.md)]

## Get the sample code

You can use Azure Pipelines to build an app written in any language. For this quickstart, we will use Java.

To get started, fork the following repository into your GitHub account.

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-java
```

## Get your first run

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to your project.

1. In your project, navigate to the **Pipelines** page. Then choose the action to create a new pipeline.

1. Walk through the steps of the wizard by first selecting **GitHub** as the location of your source code.

1. You might be redirected to GitHub to sign in. If so, enter your GitHub credentials.

1. When the list of repositories appears, select your desired sample app repository.

1. Azure Pipelines will analyze your repository and recommend a Maven pipeline template. Select **Save and run**, then select **Commit directly to the master branch**, and then choose **Save and run** again.

1. A new run is started. Wait for the run to finish.

> A build pipeline is the entity through which you define your automated build pipeline. In the build pipeline, you compose a set of tasks, each of which perform a step in your build. The task catalog provides a rich set of tasks for you to get started. You can also add PowerShell or shell scripts to your build pipeline.

## Publish an artifact from your build

A typical build produces an artifact that can then be deployed to various stages in a release. Here to demonstrate the capability in a simple way, we'll simply publish the script as the artifact.

   **Artifact Name**: Enter `drop`.

   **Artifact Type**: Select **Server**.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

> Artifacts are the files that you want your build to produce. Artifacts can be nearly anything your team needs to test or deploy your app. For example, you've got a .DLL and .EXE executable files and .PDB symbols file of a C# or C++ .NET Windows app.
>
> To enable you to produce artifacts, we provide tools such as copying with pattern matching, and a staging directory in which you can gather your artifacts before publishing them. See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](artifacts/artifacts-overview.md).

## Enable continuous integration (CI)

1. Select the **Triggers** tab.

1. Enable **Continuous integration**.

>  A continuous integration trigger on a build pipeline indicates that the system should automatically queue a new build whenever a code change is committed. You can make the trigger more general or more specific, and also schedule your build (for example, on a nightly basis). See [Build triggers](build/triggers.md).

## Save and queue the build

Save and queue a build manually and test your build pipeline.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

1. Select **Save & queue**, and then select **Save & queue**.

1. On the dialog box, select **Save & queue** once more.

   This queues a new build on the Microsoft-hosted agent.

1. You see a link to the new build on the top of the page.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![build console](_img/get-started-designer/build-console-link-to-new-build-azure-devops-newnavon.png)

   Choose the link to watch the new build as it happens. Once the agent is allocated, you'll start seeing the live logs of the build. Notice that the PowerShell script is run as part of the build, and that "Hello world" is printed to the console.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![build console](_img/get-started-designer/build-console-azure-devops-newnavon.png)

1. Go to the build summary. On the **Artifacts** tab of the build, notice that the script is published as an artifact.

## Add some variables and commit a change to your script

We'll pass some build variables to the script to make our pipeline a bit more interesting. Then we'll commit a change to a script and watch the CI pipeline run automatically to validate the change.  

1. Edit your build pipeline.

2. On the **Tasks** tab, select the PowerShell script task.

3. Add these arguments.

   **Arguments**

   ```
   -greeter "$(Build.RequestedFor)" -trigger "$(Build.Reason)"
   ```

Finally, save the build pipeline. 

Next you'll add the arguments to your script.

1. Go to your **Files** in **Azure Repos** (the **Code** hub in the previous navigation and TFS).

2. Select the **HelloWorld.ps1** file, and then **Edit** the file.

3. Change the script as follows:

   ```ps
   Param(
   [string]$greeter,
   [string]$trigger
   )
   Write-Host "Hello world" from $greeter
   Write-Host Trigger: $trigger
   ```

4. **Commit** (save) the script.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

Now you can see the results of your changes. Go to **Azure Pipelines** and select **Queued**. Notice under the **Queued or running** section that a build is automatically triggered by the change that you committed.

> A release pipeline is a collection of stages to which the application build artifacts are deployed. It also defines the actual deployment pipeline for each stage, as well as how the artifacts are promoted from one stage to another.
>
> Also, notice that we used some variables in our script arguments. In this case, we used [release variables](release/variables.md) instead of the build variables we used for the build pipeline.

## Deploy a release

Run the script in each stage.

> You can track the progress of each release to see if it has been deployed to all the stages. You can track the commits that are part of each release, the associated work items, and the results of any test runs that you've added to the release pipeline.

## Change your code and watch it automatically deploy to production

We'll make one more change to the script. This time it will automatically build and then get deployed all the way to the production stage.

1. Go to the **Code** hub, **Files** tab, edit the **HelloWorld.ps1** file, and change it as follows:

   ```ps
   Param(
   [string]$greeter,
   [string]$trigger
   )
   Write-Host "Hello world" from $greeter
   Write-Host Trigger: $trigger
   Write-Host "Now that you've got CI/CD, you can automatically deploy your app every time your team checks in code."
   ```

2. **Commit** (save) the script.

3. Select the **Builds** tab to see the build queued and run.

4. After the build is completed, select the **Releases** tab, open the new release, and then go to the **Logs**.

Your new code automatically is deployed in the **QA** stage, and then in the **Production** stage.

## Next steps

You've just learned the basics of using the classic editor to create and run a pipeline.
Now you're ready to configure your build pipeline for the programming language you're using.
Go ahead and create a new build pipeline, and this time, use one of the following templates.

| Language | Template to use | 
|-|-|
| [.NET](apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-4.md) | ASP.NET |
| [.NET Core](ecosystems/dotnet-core.md) | ASP.NET Core |
| [C++](apps/windows/cpp.md) | .NET Desktop | 
| [Go](apps/go/go.md) | Go |
| [Java](ecosystems/java.md) | Gradle |
| [JavaScript](ecosystems/javascript.md) | Node.js |
| [Xcode](ecosystems/xcode.md) | Xcode |

## Q & A

### Where can I read articles about DevOps and CI/CD?

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

[What is Continuous Integration?](/azure/devops/what-is-continuous-integration)

[What is Continuous Delivery?](/azure/devops/what-is-continuous-delivery)

[What is DevOps?](/azure/devops/what-is-devops)

<a name="version-control"></a>

### What kinds of version control can I use

We've used a Git repository in Azure Repos to keep things focused on CI/CD for this tutorial.

When you're ready to get going with CI/CD for your app, you can use the version control system of your choice:

* Clients

  * [Visual Studio Code for Windows, macOS, and Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  * [Visual Studio with Git for Windows](../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-vs.md) or [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)
  * [Visual Studio with TFVC](../repos/tfvc/share-your-code-in-tfvc-vs.md)
  * [Eclipse](../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-eclipse.md)
  * [Xcode](../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-xcode.md)
  * [IntelliJ](../java/download-intellij-plug-in.md)
  * [Command line](../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-cmdline.md)

* Services
  * [Azure Pipelines](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/)
  * Git service providers such as GitHub and Bitbucket Cloud
  * Subversion

### How do I replicate a pipeline?

If your pipeline has a pattern that you want to replicate in other pipelines, clone it, export it, or save it as a template.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![all-definitions-build-action-menu-replicate-actions](_img/get-started-designer/all-definitions-build-action-menu-replicate-actions-newnav.png)
>

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

![all-definitions-build-action-menu-replicate-actions](_img/get-started-designer/all-definitions-build-action-menu-replicate-actions.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

After you clone a pipeline, you can make changes and then save it.

After you export a pipeline, you can import it from the **All pipelines** tab.

After you create a template, your team members can use it to follow the pattern in new pipelines.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're using the **New Build Editor**, then your custom templates are shown at the bottom of the list.

### How do I work with drafts?

If you're editing a build pipeline and you want to test some changes that are not yet ready for production, you can save it as a draft.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![save-as-draft](_img/get-started-designer/save-as-draft-newnav.png)
>

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

![save-as-draft](_img/get-started-designer/save-as-draft.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

You can edit and test your draft as needed.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![edit draft](_img/get-started-designer/edit-draft-newnav.png)
>

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"

![edit draft](_img/get-started-designer/edit-draft.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

When you're ready you can publish the draft to merge the changes into your build pipeline.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![publish draft](_img/get-started-designer/publish-draft-newnav.png)
>

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

![publish draft](_img/get-started-designer/publish-draft.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

Or, if you decide to discard the draft, you can delete it from the **All Pipeline** tab shown above.

### How can I delete a pipeline?

To delete a pipeline, navigate to the summary page for that pipeline, and choose **Delete** from the **...** menu in the top-right of the page. Type the name of the pipeline to confirm, and choose **Delete**.

<a name="queueabuild"></a>

### What else can I do when I queue a build?

You can queue builds [automatically](build/triggers.md) or manually.

When you manually queue a build, you can, for a single run of the build:

* Specify the [pool](agents/pools-queues.md) into which the build goes.

* Add and modify some [variables](build/variables.md).

* Add [demands](process/demands.md).

* In a Git repository

  - Build a [branch](../repos/git/branches.md) or a [tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).

  - Build a [commit](../repos/git/commits.md).

* In a TFVC repository

  - Specify the source version as a [label](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181439.aspx) or [changeset](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181408.aspx).

  - Run a private build of a [shelveset](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181403.aspx). (You can use this option on either a [Microsoft-hosted agent](agents/hosted.md) or a [self-hosted agent](agents/agents.md).)

### Where can I learn more about build pipeline settings?

To learn more about build pipeline settings, see:

* [Getting sources](repos/index.md)
* [Tasks](tasks/index.md)
* [Variables](build/variables.md)
* [Triggers](build/triggers.md)
* [Options](build/options.md)
* [Retention](policies/retention.md)
* [History](build/history.md)

### How do I programmatically create a build pipeline?

[REST API Reference: Create a build pipeline](../integrate/index.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can also manage builds and build pipelines from the command line or scripts using the [Azure Pipelines CLI](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/?view=azure-cli-latest).
