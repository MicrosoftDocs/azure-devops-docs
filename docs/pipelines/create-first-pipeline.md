# Create your first pipeline

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2017-rtm](includes/version-tfs-2017-rtm.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

This is a step-by-step guide to using Azure Pipelines to build a GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites - Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [include](includes/prerequisites.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to create a new pipeline by copying another pipeline, see [Clone or import a pipeline](./get-started/clone-import-pipeline.md).

## Create your first pipeline

#### [Java](#tab/java)

### Get the Java sample code

To get started, fork the following repository into your GitHub account.

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-java
```

### Create your first Java pipeline

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to your project.

2. In your project, navigate to the **Pipelines** page. Then choose the action to create a new pipeline.

3. Walk through the steps of the wizard by first selecting **GitHub** as the location of your source code.

4. You might be redirected to GitHub to sign in. If so, enter your GitHub credentials.

5. When the list of repositories appears, select your desired sample app repository.

6. Azure Pipelines will analyze your repository and recommend a Maven pipeline template. Select **Save and run**, then select **Commit directly to the main branch**, and then choose **Save and run** again.

7. A new run is started. Wait for the run to finish.

Learn more about [working with Java](ecosystems/java.md) in your pipeline.  

#### [.NET](#tab/net)

### Get the .NET Core sample code

To get started, fork the following repository into your GitHub account.

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-dotnet-core
```

### Create your first .NET Core pipeline

[!INCLUDE [include](ecosystems/includes/create-pipeline-before-template-selected.md)]

> When the **Configure** tab appears, select **ASP.NET Core**.

1. When your new pipeline appears, take a look at the YAML to see what it does. When you're ready, select **Save and run**.

2. You're prompted to commit a new _azure-pipelines.yml_ file to your repository. After you're happy with the message, select **Save and run** again.

   If you want to watch your pipeline in action, select the build job.

   > You just created and ran a pipeline that we automatically created for you, because your code appeared to be a good match for the [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-yaml/blob/master/templates/asp.net-core.yml) template.

   You now have a working YAML pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`) in your repository that's ready for you to customize!

3. When you're ready to make changes to your pipeline, select it in the **Pipelines** page, and then **Edit** the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

Learn more about [working with .NET Core](ecosystems/dotnet-core.md) in your pipeline.

#### [Python](#tab/python)

### Get the Python sample code

To get started, fork the following repository into your GitHub account.

```
https://github.com/Microsoft/python-sample-vscode-flask-tutorial
```

### Create your first Python pipeline

[!INCLUDE [include](ecosystems/includes/create-pipeline-before-template-selected.md)]

> When the **Configure** tab appears, select **Python package**. This will create a Python package to test on multiple Python versions.

7. When your new pipeline appears, take a look at the YAML to see what it does. When you're ready, select **Save and run**.

8. You're prompted to commit a new _azure-pipelines.yml_ file to your repository. After you're happy with the message, select **Save and run** again.

   If you want to watch your pipeline in action, select the build job.

   > You just created and ran a pipeline that we automatically created for you, because your code appeared to be a good match for the [Python package](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-yaml/blob/master/templates/python-package.yml) template.

   You now have a working YAML pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`) in your repository that's ready for you to customize!

9. When you're ready to make changes to your pipeline, select it in the **Pipelines** page, and then **Edit** the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

Learn more about [working with Python](ecosystems/python.md) in your pipeline.

#### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

### Get the JavaScript sample code

To get started, fork the following repository into your GitHub account.

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-javascript
```

### Create your first JavaScript pipeline

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to your project.

2. In your project, navigate to the **Pipelines** page. Then choose the action to create a new pipeline.

3. Walk through the steps of the wizard by first selecting **GitHub** as the location of your source code.

> A build pipeline is the entity through which you define your automated build pipeline. In the build pipeline, you compose a set of tasks, each of which perform a step in your build. The task catalog provides a rich set of tasks for you to get started. You can also add PowerShell or shell scripts to your build pipeline.

## Publish an artifact from your build

A typical build produces an artifact that can then be deployed to various stages in a release. Here to demonstrate the capability in a simple way, we'll simply publish the script as the artifact.

> Artifacts are the files that you want your build to produce. Artifacts can be nearly anything your team needs to test or deploy your app. For example, you've got a .DLL and .EXE executable files and .PDB symbols file of a C# or C++ .NET Windows app.
>
> To enable you to produce artifacts, we provide tools such as copying with pattern matching, and a staging directory in which you can gather your artifacts before publishing them. See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](artifacts/artifacts-overview.md).

## Enable continuous integration (CI)

1. Select the **Triggers** tab.

1. Enable **Continuous integration**.

>  A continuous integration trigger on a build pipeline indicates that the system should automatically queue a new build whenever a code change is committed. You can make the trigger more general or more specific, and also schedule your build (for example, on a nightly basis). See [Build triggers](build/triggers.md).

## Save and queue the build

Save and queue a build manually and test your build pipeline.

### How do I replicate a pipeline?

If your pipeline has a pattern that you want to replicate in other pipelines, clone it, export it, or save it as a template.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![all-definitions-build-action-menu-replicate-actions](media/get-started-designer/all-definitions-build-action-menu-replicate-actions-newnav.png)

![Screenshot showing how to replicate a pipeline.](media/get-started-designer/all-definitions-build-action-menu-replicate-actions.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

After you clone a pipeline, you can make changes and then save it.

After you export a pipeline, you can import it from the **All pipelines** tab.

After you create a template, your team members can use it to follow the pattern in new pipelines.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're using the **New Build Editor**, then your custom templates are shown at the bottom of the list.


### How do I work with drafts?

If you're editing a build pipeline and you want to test some changes that are not yet ready for production, you can save it as a draft.

::: moniker-end

![edit draft - TFS 2017](media/get-started-designer/edit-draft.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2020"

When you're ready you can publish the draft to merge the changes into your build pipeline.

### What else can I do when I queue a build?

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2020"

You can queue builds [automatically](build/triggers.md) or manually.

When you manually queue a build, you can, for a single run of the build:

* Specify the [pool](agents/pools-queues.md) into which the build goes.

* Add and modify some [variables](build/variables.md).

* Add [demands](process/demands.md).

* In a Git repository

  - Build a [branch](../repos/git/create-branch.md) or a [tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging).

  - Build a [commit](../repos/git/commits.md).

* In a TFVC repository

  - Specify the source version as a [label](../repos/tfvc/use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md?viewFallbackFrom=vsts) or [changeset](../repos/tfvc/find-view-changesets.md?viewFallbackFrom=vsts).

  - Run a private build of a [shelveset](../repos/tfvc/suspend-your-work-manage-your-shelvesets.md?viewFallbackFrom=vsts). (You can use this option on either a [Microsoft-hosted agent](agents/hosted.md) or a [self-hosted agent](agents/agents.md).)

### How do I programmatically create a build pipeline?

[REST API Reference: Create a build pipeline](../integrate/index.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can also manage builds and build pipelines from the command line or scripts using the [Azure Pipelines CLI](/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).

### Can I use a single command at the command line to run multiple pipelines in Azure DevOps Services?

Currently, the Azure CLI and Azure APIs don't offer commands that run multiple pipelines from the command line. You can use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/pipelines) to list all pipelines and definitions and provide a *single* release or build ID as a parameter. All commands are designed to work for independent runs of independent pipelines, and they require unique ID requests that allow only one, unique value. To learn about pipeline triggers, see [Specify events that trigger pipelines](./build/triggers.md).
