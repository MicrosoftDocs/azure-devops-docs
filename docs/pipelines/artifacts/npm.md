# Publish npm packages (YAML/Classic)

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Using Azure Pipelines, you can publish your npm packages to Azure Artifacts feeds or to public registries such as *npmjs.com*. In this article, you will learn how to publish your npm packages using YAML and Classic pipelines.

## Publish to Azure Artifacts feeds

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

> [!NOTE]
> The **Project Collection Build Service** and your project's **Build Service** identity must be set to **Contributor** to publish your packages to a feed using Azure Pipelines. See [Add new users/groups](../../artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions.md#configure-feed-settings) for more details.

```yaml
- task: Npm@1
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishRegistry: useFeed
    publishFeed: <FEED_NAME>        ## For project-scoped feeds, use: <PROJECT_NAME>/<FEED_NAME> 
```

- **publishRegistry**: Options: *useExternalRegistry*, *useFeed*.  Select *useFeed* to use a feed within your organization.
- **publishFeed**: Required when publishRegistry = useFeed. The feed you want to publish to.

> [!TIP]
> Using the YAML editor to add the npm publish task will generate the project and feed IDs for your `publishFeed`.

  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishRegistry: useExternalRegistry
    publishEndpoint: '<NAME_OF_YOUR_SERVICE_CONNECTION>'
```
