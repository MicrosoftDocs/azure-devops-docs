# Publish npm packages

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**

You can publish npm packages produced by your build to:

* Azure Artifacts or the TFS Package Management service.
* Other registries such as `https://registry.npmjs.org/`.

Before you read this topic, you should understand the kind of build pipeline you're creating: [designer](../get-started-designer.md) or [YAML](../get-started-yaml.md).

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"
[!INCLUDE [package management permissions](_shared/package-management-permissions-for-yaml-build.md)]

To publish to an external npm registry, you must first create a service connection to point to that feed. You can do this by going to **Project settings**, selecting **Services**, and then creating a **New service connection**. Select the **npm** option for the service connection. Fill in the registry URL and the credentials to connect to the registry.

To publish a package to an npm registry, add the following snippet to your azure-pipelines.yml file.

```yaml
- task: Npm@1
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishEndpoint: '<copy and paste the name of the service connection here>'
```

For a list of other options, see the [npm task](../tasks/package/npm.md).

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

To publish an npm package to a Package Management feed, add the **npm** task. Then, configure these options:

- **working folder**: Select the folder that contains your `.npmrc` and `package.json`; leave blank if those files are at the root of the repo
- **npm command**: `publish`

To publish to an external npm registry, you must first create a service connection to point to that registry. You can do this by going to **Project settings**, selecting **Service connections**, and then creating a **New service connection**. Select the **npm** option for the service connection. Fill in the registry URL and the credentials to connect to the registry.

> [!NOTE]
> The build does not support using the `publishConfig` property to specify the `registry` to which you're publishing. Ensure that your working folder has an `.npmrc` file with a `registry=` line, as detailed in the **Connect to feed** screen in your feed.
