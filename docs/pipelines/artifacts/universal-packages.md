# Publish and download Universal Packages with Azure Pipelines

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Universal Packages allow you to package any number of files of any type and share them with your team. Using the Universal Package task in Azure Pipelines, you can pack, publish, and download packages of various sizes, up to 4 TB. Each package is uniquely identified with a name and a version number. You can use Azure CLI or Azure Pipelines to publish and consume packages from your Artifacts feeds.

> [!NOTE]
> Universal Packages are only available in Azure DevOps Services.

## Copy files

The Universal Packages task in Azure Pipelines is set to use `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` as the default publish directory. To ready your Universal Package for publishing, move the files you wish to publish to that directory. You can also use the [Copy Files](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) utility task to copy those files to the publish directory.

## Publish a Universal Package

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

To publish a Universal Package to your Azure Artifacts feed, add the following task to your pipeline's YAML file.

```yaml
- task: UniversalPackages@0
  displayName: Publish a Universal Package
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishDirectory: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    vstsFeedPublish: '<projectName>/<feedName>'
    vstsFeedPackagePublish: '<Package name>'
    packagePublishDescription: '<Package description>'
```

| Argument                    | Description                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| publishDirectory            | Location of the files you wish to publish.                                                                                |
| vstsFeedPublish             | The project and feed name to publish to. If you're working with an organization-scoped feed, specify only the feed name.  |
| vstsFeedPackagePublish      | The package name. Must be lower case. Use only letters, numbers, and dashes.                                              |
| packagePublishDescription   | Description of the package content.                                                                                       |

To publish packages to an Azure Artifacts feed from your pipeline, the pipeline identity must have the **Feed Publisher (Contributor)** role on the feed. For more information, see [Pipelines permissions](../../artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions.md#pipelines-permissions).

To publish to an external feed, you must first create a service connection to authenticate with your feed. For more information, see [Manage service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md). 

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

To publish your Universal Package, add the **Universal Package** task to your pipeline and fill out the required fields as follows:

- **Command:** Publish
- **Path to file(s) to publish:** The path to the list of files to be published. Default: `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`.
- **Feed location:** Publish to an Azure Artifacts feed in your current organization or in another organization.
- **Destination feed:** Select the feed that you want to publish to.
- **Package name:** Select an existing package (to publish a new version of that package), or enter a new package name (to publish the first version of a new package).

[!INCLUDE [package management permissions](includes/package-management-permissions-for-web-build.md)]

To publish to an external feed, you must first create a service connection to point to that feed. For more information, see [Manage service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md).

## Package versioning

Universal Packages follow the semantic versioning specification and can be identified by their names and version numbers. Semantic version numbers are composed of three numeric components, Major, Minor, and Patch, in the format: `Major.Minor.Patch`.

The minor version number is incremented when new features are added that are backward compatible with previous versions, in this case, you increment the minor version and reset the patch version to 0 (`1.4.17` to `1.5.0`). The major version number is incremented when there are significant changes that could break compatibility with previous versions. In this case, you increment the major version and reset the minor and patch versions to 0 (`2.6.5` to `3.0.0`). The patch version number should be incremented when only bug fixes or other small changes are made that don't affect compatibility with previous versions (`1.0.0` to `1.0.1`). 

When publishing a new package, the Universal Packages task will automatically select the next major, minor, or patch version for you.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

To enable versioning for your package, add a `versionOption` input to your YAML file. The options for publishing a new package version are: `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or `custom`.

Selecting `custom` enables you to manually specify your package version. The other options get the latest package version from your feed and increment the chosen version segment by 1. So if you have a *testPackage 1.0.0*, and select the *major* option, your new package will be *testPackage 2.0.0*. If you select the *minor* option, your package version will be *1.1.0*, and if you select the *patch* option, your package version will be *1.0.1*.

If you choose the `custom` option, you must also specify a `versionPublish` value as follows:

```yaml
- task: UniversalPackages@0
  displayName: Publish a Universal Package
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishDirectory: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    vstsFeedPublish: '<projectName>/<feedName>'
    vstsFeedPackagePublish: '<Package name>'
    versionOption: custom
    versionPublish: '<Package version>'
    packagePublishDescription: '<Package description>'
```

| versionOption                | Select a versioning strategy. Options: `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `custom`.                                               |
| versionPublish               | The custom package version.                                                                                               |
