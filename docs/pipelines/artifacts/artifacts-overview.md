# Artifacts in Azure Pipelines - overview

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Artifacts allow developers to publish and consume various types of packages from feeds and public registries like PyPI, Maven Central, and NuGet.org. You can combine Azure Artifacts with Azure Pipelines to publish build and pipeline artifacts, deploy packages, or integrate files across different stages of your pipeline for building, testing, or deploying your application.
