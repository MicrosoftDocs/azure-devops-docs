# Artifacts in Azure Pipelines - overview

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Artifacts enable developers to consume and publish different types of packages to Artifacts feeds and public registries such as NuGet.org and npmjs.com. You can use Azure Artifacts in conjunction with Azure Pipelines to deploy packages, publish build artifacts, or integrate files between your pipeline stages to build, test, or deploy your application.

## Supported artifact types

|         Artifact type                        |                                                 Description                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Build artifacts](build-artifacts.md)        | The files generated by a build. Example: .dll, .exe, or .PDB files.                                                    |
| [NuGet](nuget.md)                            | Publish NuGet packages to Azure Artifacts feeds or public registries such as nuget.org.                                |
| [npm](npm.md)                                | Publish npm packages to Azure Artifacts feeds or public registries such as nmpjs.com.                                  |
| [Maven](../../artifacts/get-started-maven.md)| Publish Maven packages to Azure Artifacts feeds.                                           |
| [PyPI](pypi.md)                              | Publish Python packages to Azure Artifacts feeds or PyPI.org.                                                          |
| [Universal packages](universal-packages.md)  | Publish Universal Packages to Azure Artifacts feeds.                                                                   |
| [Symbols](symbols.md)                        | Symbol files contain debugging information about the compiled executables. You can publish symbols to Azure Artifacts symbol server or to a file share. Symbol servers enable debuggers to automatically retrieve the correct symbol files without knowing the specific product, package, or build information.                                                                                                                                                      |
