# Artifacts in Azure Pipelines

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Artifacts enables developers to store multiple types of packages in a single feed. With Azure Pipelines, you can publish packages to both private and public Azure Artifacts feeds or registries such as NuGet.org and npmjs.com. Azure Pipelines also allows you to integrate files across different stages of your workflow; building, testing, and deploying artifacts to multiple environments.

## FAQ

#### Q: What are build artifacts?

A: Build artifacts are files produced during the build process. See [Build Artifacts](build-artifacts.md) to learn more about how to publish and download build artifacts.

#### Q: Can I delete pipeline artifacts when rerunning failed jobs?

A: Pipeline artifacts cannot be deleted or overwritten. To regenerate artifacts when rerunning a failed job, include the job ID in the artifact name using the variable `$(System.JobId)`. See [System variables](../build/variables.md#system-variables) to learn more about predefined variables.

#### Q: How can I access Artifacts feeds behind a firewall?

A:  If your organization uses a firewall or proxy, make sure you allow [Azure Artifacts Domain URLs and IP addresses](../../organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url.md#azure-artifacts).
