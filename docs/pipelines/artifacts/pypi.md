# Publish Python packages in Azure Pipelines

**Azure Pipelines**

> [!NOTE]
> Python package publishing in Azure Pipelines is currently in public preview.

You can publish Python packages produced by your build to:

* Azure Artifacts
* Other repositories such as `https://pypi.org/`

Before you read this topic, you should understand the kind of build pipeline you're creating: [visual designer](../get-started-designer.md) or [YAML](../get-started-yaml.md).

To publish Python packages produced by your build, you'll use [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/), a widely used tool for publishing Python packages. This guide covers how to do the following in your pipeline:

0. Install `twine` on your build agent
0. Authenticate `twine` with your Azure Artifacts feeds
0. Use a custom task that invokes `twine` to publish your Python packages

## Install twine 

First, you'll need to run `pip install twine` to ensure the build agent has `twine` installed.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

```yaml
- script: 'pip install twine'
```

Check out the [script YAML task reference](../yaml-schema.md#script) for the schema for this command.

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

* Type

 ```
inline
```
* Script

 ```
pip install twine
```

## Authenticate Azure Artifacts with twine

To use `twine` to publish Python packages, you first need to set up authentication. The [Python Twine Authenticate](../tasks/package/twine-authenticate.md) task stores your authentication credentials in an environment variable (`PYPIRC_PATH`). `twine` will reference this variable later.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

To authenticate with `twine`, add the following snippet to your _azure-pipelines.yml_ file.

```yaml
- task: TwineAuthenticate@0
  inputs:
    artifactFeeds: 'feed_name1, feed_name2'
    externalFeeds: 'feed_name1, feed_name2'
```

* **artifactFeeds**: the name of one or more Azure Artifacts feeds within your organization
* **externalFeeds**: the name of one or more [external connection endpoints](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints), including PyPI or feeds in other organizations in Azure DevOps

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

![icon](../tasks/package/_img/python-twine-authenticate.png) **Package: Python Twine Upload Authenticate**

* My feeds 

   Select feeds that you want to authenticate with `twine`.

* Feeds from external organizations

   Select feeds from outside the organization that you want to authenticate with `twine`.

## Use a custom twine task to publish

After you've set up authentication with the preceding snippet, you can use `twine` to publish your Python packages. The following example uses a custom command-line task.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

```yaml
- script: 'twine -r {feedName/EndpointName} --config-file $(PYPIRC_PATH) {package path to publish}'
```

Check out the [script YAML task reference](../yaml-schema.md#script) for the schema for this command.

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

![icon](../tasks/utility/_img/powershell.png) **Utility: Powershell**

* Type:

   ```
   inline
   ```
* Script:

   ```
   twine -r {feedName/EndpointName} --config-file $(PYPIRC_PATH) {package path to publish}
   ```

## Tips and FAQs

* The authentication credentials written into the `PYPIRC_PATH` environment variable supersede those in your .ini and .conf files. 

2. If you add multiple Python Twine Authenticate tasks at different times in your pipeline steps, each additional build task execution will extend (not override) the existing `PYPIRC_PATH` environment variable.

3. Lastly, we strongly recommend **NOT** checking into source control any credentials or tokens.
