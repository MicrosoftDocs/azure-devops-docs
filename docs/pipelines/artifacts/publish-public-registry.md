# Publish NuGet packages to NuGet.org (Classic/YAML)

Using Azure Pipelines, developers can streamline the process of publishing their NuGet packages to feeds and public registries. This article will walk you through publishing your NuGet packages to NuGet.org.

## Prerequisites

| **Product**       | **Requirements**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

1. Select the **Grant access permission to all pipelines** checkbox, and then select **Save** when you're done.

## Publish packages

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Ubuntu 24.04 or higher, you must use the `NuGetAuthenticate` task with the .NET CLI instead of the `NuGetCommand@2` task. See [Support for newer Ubuntu hosted images](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2#support-for-newer-ubuntu-hosted-images) for more details.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines**, select your pipeline definition, and then select **Edit**.

1. Add the following snippet to your YAML pipeline. Replace the placeholder with the name of the service connection you created earlier:

    ```yml
    steps:
    - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
      displayName: 'dotnet pack'
      inputs:
        command: pack
    - task: NuGetCommand@2
      displayName: 'NuGet push'
      inputs:
        command: push
        nuGetFeedType: external
        publishFeedCredentials: <NAME_OF_YOUR_SERVICE_CONNECTION>
    ```

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines**, select your pipeline definition, and then select **Edit**.

1. Select **+** to add a new task, and then add the **.NET Core** task to your pipeline.

1. From the command dropdown, select **pack**, and then select the **Path to csproj or nuspec file(s) to pack**. You can leave the default values for the other fields.

1. Select **+** to add another task, then add the **NuGet** task to your pipeline.

1. From the command dropdown, select **push**, and then select the **Path to NuGet package(s) to publish**.

1. Select **External NuGet server** for the **Target feed location**, and then select the service connection you created earlier from **NuGet server** dropdown menu.
