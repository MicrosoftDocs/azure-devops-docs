# Deploy to VMware vCenter Server

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2017-rtm](../_shared/version-tfs-2017-rtm.md)]

You can automatically provision virtual machines in a VMware environment and deploy to those virtual machines after every successful build. Before this guidance, read the [web quickstart](../get-started-designer.md).

## VMware connection

::: moniker range="vsts"

You need to first configure how Azure Pipelines connects to vCenter. You cannot use Microsoft-hosted agents to run VMware tasks since the vSphere SDK is not installed on these machines. You have to a set up a self-hosted agent that can communicate with the vCenter server.

1. Install the VMware vSphere Management 
SDK to call VMware API functions that access vSphere
web services. To install and configure the SDK on 
the agent machine:

   * Download and install the latest 
     version of the Java Runtime Environment from 
     [this location](http://aka.ms/downloadjre).

   * Go to [this location](http://aka.ms/vspheresdk)
     and sign in with your existing credentials or register
     with the website. Then download the **vSphere 6.0 
     Management SDK**.

   * Create a directory for the vSphere Management SDK
     such as **C:\vSphereSDK**. Do not include spaces in 
     the directory names to avoid issues with some of the
     batch and script files included in the SDK.

   * Unpack the vSphere Management SDK into the 
     new folder you just created.

   * Add the full path and name of the precompiled 
     VMware Java SDK file **vim25.jar** to the machine's 
     CLASSPATH environment variable. If you used the path and name
     **C:\vSphereSDK** for the SDK files, as shown above, the full
     path will be:  
     `C:\vSphereSDK\SDK\vsphere-ws\java\JAXWS\lib\vim25.jar`<p />

1. Install the [VMware extension ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.vmwareapp)
   from Visual Studio Marketplace into TFS or Azure Pipelines.

1. Follow these steps to create a vCenter Server service connection in your project:

   * Open your Azure Pipelines or TFS project in 
     your web browser. Choose the **Settings** icon in the menu bar and select **Services**.

   * In the **Services** tab, choose **New service connection**, and select **VMware vCenter Server**.

   * In the **Add new VMware vCenter Server Connection** 
     dialog, enter the values required to connect to the 
     vCenter Server:

     - **Connection Name**: Enter a user-friendly name 
       for the service connection such as **Fabrikam vCenter**.
     - **vCenter Server URL**: Enter the URL of the 
       vCenter server, in the form `https://machine.domain.com/`.
       Note that only **HTTPS** connections are supported.
     - **Username** and **Password**: Enter the credentials
       required to connect to the vCenter Server.
       Username formats such as **username**, **domain\\username**,
       **machine-name\\username**, and **.\\username** are supported.
       UPN formats such as **username@domain.com** and built-in system 
       accounts such as **NT Authority\\System** are not supported.<p/>

## Managing VM snapshots

Use the **VMware Resource Deployment** task from the VMware extension and configure the properties as follows to take snapshot of virtual machines, or to revert or delete them:
   
   - **VMware Service Connection**: Select the VMware vCenter Server connection you created earlier.
   
   - **Action**: Select one of the actions: **Take Snapshot of Virtual Machines**, **Revert Snapshot of Virtual Machines**, or **Delete Snapshot of Virtual Machines**.
   
   - **Virtual Machine Names**: Enter the names of one or more virtual machines. Separate multiple names with a comma; for example, `VM1,VM2,VM3`
   
   - **Datacenter**: Enter the name of the datacenter where the virtual machines will be created.
   
   - **Snapshot Name**: Enter the name of the snapshot. This snapshot must exist if you use the revert or delete action.
   
   - **Host Name**: Depending on the option you selected for the compute resource type, enter the name of the host, cluster, or resource pool.
   
   - **Datastore**: Enter the name of the datastore that will hold the virtual machines' configuration and disk files.
   
   - **Description**: Optional. Enter a description for the **Take Snapshot of Virtual Machines** action, such as `$(Build.DefinitionName).$(Build.BuildNumber)`. This can be used to track the execution of the build or release that created the snapshot.
   
   - **Skip Certificate Authority Check**: If the vCenter Server's certificate is self-signed, select this option to skip the validation of the certificate by a trusted certificate authority.<p />

   >To verify if a self-signed certificate is installed 
   on the vCenter Server, open the VMware vSphere Web 
   Client in your browser and check for a certificate
   error page. The vSphere Web Client URL will be 
   of the form `https://machine.domain/vsphere-client/`.
   Good practice guidance for vCenter Server certificates 
   can be found in the [VMware Knowledge Base](http://aka.ms/vcentercertificate)
   (article 2057223).

## Provisioning virtual machines

To configure the **VMware Resource Deployment** task to provision a new virtual machine from a template, use these settings:

   - **VMware Service Connection**: Select the VMware vCenter Server connection you created earlier.
   
   - **Action**: `Deploy Virtual Machines using Template`
   
   - **Template**: The name of the template that will be used to create the virtual machines. The template must exist in the location you enter for the **Datacenter** parameter.
   
   - **Virtual Machine Names**: Enter the names of one or more virtual machines. Separate multiple names with a comma; for example, `VM1,VM2,VM3`
   
   - **Datacenter**: Enter the name of the datacenter where the virtual machines will be created.
   
   - **Compute Resource Type**: Select the type of hosting for the virtual machines: `VMware ESXi Host`, `Cluster`, or `Resource Pool`
   
   - **Host Name**: Depending on the option you selected for the compute resource type, enter the name of the host, cluster, or resource pool.
   
   - **Datastore**: Enter the name of the datastore that will hold the virtual machines' configuration and disk files.
   
   - **Description**: Optional. Enter a description to identify the deployment.
   
   - **Skip Certificate Authority Check**: If the vCenter Server's certificate is self-signed, select this option to skip the validation of the certificate by a trusted certificate authority. See the note for the previous step to check for the presence of a self-signed certificate.<p />

## Deploying build to virtual machines

Once you have the virtual machines set up, deploying a build to those virtual machines is no different than deploying to any other machine. For instance, you can:

* Use the [PowerShell on Target Machines](../tasks/deploy/powershell-on-target-machines.md) task to run remote scripts on those machines using Windows Remote Management.
* Use [Deployment groups](../release/deployment-groups/index.md) to run scripts and other tasks on those machines using build and release agent.
