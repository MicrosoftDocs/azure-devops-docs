### Do I need an agent?

You need at least one [agent](../agents/agents.md) to run your build or release.

### I'm having problems. How can I troubleshoot them?

See [Troubleshoot Build and Release](../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md).

### I can't select a default agent pool and I can't queue my build or release. How do I fix this?

See [Agent pools](../agents/pools-queues.md).
