* While the simplest way to try this quickstart is to use an Azure DevOps organization, you can also use TFS. Make sure that you have [configured a build agent](../agents/v2-windows.md) for your project, and that you have Visual Studio 2017 installed on the agent machine and that you installed the latest Visual Studio update.
