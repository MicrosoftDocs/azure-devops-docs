* A GitHub account, where you can create a repository. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://github.com).

* An Azure DevOps organization. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](../get-started/pipelines-sign-up.md). (An Azure DevOps organization is different from your GitHub organization. Give them the same name if you want alignment between them.)

  If your team already has one, then make sure you're an administrator of the Azure DevOps project that you want to use.

* An ability to run pipelines on Microsoft-hosted agents. You can either purchase a [parallel job](licensing/concurrent-jobs.md) or you can request a free tier. To request a free tier, follow the instructions in [this article](licensing/concurrent-jobs.md). Please note that it may take us 2-3 business days to grant the free tier.
