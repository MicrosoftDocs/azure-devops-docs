Make sure you have the following items:

* A GitHub account where you can create a repository. [Create one for free](https://github.com).

* An Azure DevOps organization. [Create one for free](../get-started/pipelines-sign-up.md). 
  If your team already has one, then make sure you're an administrator of the Azure DevOps project that you want to use.

* An ability to run pipelines on Microsoft-hosted agents. You can either purchase a [parallel job](../licensing/concurrent-jobs.md) or you can request a free tier.
