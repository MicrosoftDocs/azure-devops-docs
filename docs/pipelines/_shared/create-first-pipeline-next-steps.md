## Next steps

You've just learned how to create your first Azure Pipeline. Now you're ready to configure a pipeline for the language of your choice:

* [.NET Core](../languages/dotnet-core.md)
* [Docker](../languages/docker.md)
* [Go](../languages/go.md)
* [Java](../languages/java.md)
* [Node.js](../languages/javascript.md)
* [Python](../languages/python.md)

Or, you can proceed to [customize the pipeline](../customize-pipeline.md) you just created.

To run your pipeline in a container, see [Container jobs](../process/container-phases.md).

For details about building GitHub repositories, see [Build GitHub repositories](../repos/github.md).

To learn what else you can do in YAML pipelines, see [YAML schema reference](../yaml-schema.md).
