### I use TFS on-premises and I don't see some of these features. Why not?

Some of these features are available only on
[Azure Pipelines](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/)
and not yet available on-premises. Some features are available on-premises if you have
[upgraded to the latest version of TFS](/azure/devops/server/upgrade/get-started).
