* You need an Azure DevOps organization. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137). If your team already has one, then make sure you're an administrator of the project you want to use. An Azure DevOps organization is different than your GitHub organization. It's common to give it the same as your GitHub organization so there's alignment across them.
