You can create a variable group that links to existing Azure key vaults and maps selected key vault secrets to the variable group. Only the secret names are mapped to the variable group, not the secret values. When pipelines run, they link to the variable group to fetch the latest secret values from the vault at runtime.

Any changes made to existing secrets in the key vault are automatically available to all the pipelines that use the variable group. However, if secrets are added to or deleted from the vault, the associated variable groups don't automatically update. You must explicitly update the secrets to include in the variable group.

Although Key Vault supports storing and managing cryptographic keys and certificates in Azure, Azure Pipelines variable group integration only supports mapping key vault secrets. Cryptographic keys and certificates aren't supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Key vaults that use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) aren't supported.

### Prerequisites

| Product | Requirements|
|---------|-------------|
| Azure DevOps | - An [Azure DevOps project](../../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).<br> - An [Azure Resource Manager service connection](../../library/connect-to-azure.md) for your project.<br>  - **Permissions:**<br>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To use service connections: Have at least the *User* role for the [service connection](../../policies/permissions.md#set-service-connection-security-in-azure-pipelines).<br>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To create a variable group: Have at least *Creator* [library permission](../../policies/permissions.md#set-library-security-in-azure-pipelines).  |
| Azure | - An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).<br> - **Permissions:**<br>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create a key vault: Have at least the *Owner* role for the subscription.|


### Create a key vault

Create an Azure key vault.  

1. In the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.
1. Search for and select **Key Vault**, then select **Create**.
1. Select your subscription.
1. Select an existing resource group or create a new one.
1. Enter a name for the key vault.
1. Select a region.
1. Select the **Access and configuration** tab.
1. Select **Vault access policy**. 
1. Select your account as the principal.
1. Select **Review + create** and then **Create**.


### Create the variable group linked to the key vault

1. In your Azure DevOps project, select **Pipelines** > **Library** > **+ Variable group**.
1. On the **Variable groups** page, enter a name and optional description for the variable group.
1. Enable the **Link secrets from an Azure key vault as variables** toggle.
1. Select your service connection and select **Authorize**.
1. Select your key vault name and enable Azure DevOps to access the key vault by selecting **Authorize** next to the vault name.
1. Select **+ Add** and on the **Choose secrets** screen, select the secrets from your vault for mapping to this variable group, then select **OK**.
1. Select **Save** to save the secret variable group.

>[!NOTE]
>Your service connection must have at least **Get** and **List** permissions on the key vault, which you can authorize in the preceding steps. You can also provide these permissions from the Azure portal by following these steps:
>
>1. Open **Settings** for the key vault, and then choose **Access configuration** > **Go to access policies**.
>1. On the **Access policies** page, if your Azure Pipelines project isn't listed under **Applications** with at least **Get** and **List** permissions, select **Create**.
>1. Under **Secret permissions**, select **Get** and **List**, and then select **Next**.
>1. Select your principal, and then select **Next**.
>1. Select **Next** again, review the settings, and then select **Create**.
