# About pipeline resources

A resource is anything used by a pipeline that lives outside the pipeline. [Resources](resources.md) are defined at one place and can be consumed anywhere in your pipeline. Resources can be [protected or open](../security/resources.md). 

Resources include:
- [agent pools](../agents/agents.md)
- [variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md)
- [secure files](../library/secure-files.md)
- [service connections](../library/service-endpoints.md)
- [environments](../process/environments.md)
- [repositories](resources.md#resources-repositories)
- [artifacts](../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md)
- [pipelines](resources.md#resources-pipelines)
- [containers](resources.md#resources-containers)
