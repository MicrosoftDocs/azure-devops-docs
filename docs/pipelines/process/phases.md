## Specifying jobs

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

In the simplest case, a pipeline has a single job. In that case, you do not have to explicitly use the `job` keyword. You can directly specify the steps in your YAML file.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'
steps:
- bash: echo "Hello world"
```

You may want to specify additional properties on that job. In that case, you can use the `job` keyword.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: myJob
  timeoutInMinutes: 10
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'
  steps:
  - bash: echo "Hello world"
```

Your pipeline may have multiple jobs. In that case, use the `jobs` keyword.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  - bash: echo "A"

- job: B
  steps:
  - bash: echo "B"
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Your pipeline may have multiple stages, each with multiple jobs. In that case, use the `stages` keyword.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: A
  jobs:
  - job: A1
  - job: A2

- stage: B
  jobs:
  - job: B1
  - job: B2
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The full syntax to specify a job is:

```yaml
- job: string  # name of the job, A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore
  displayName: string  # friendly name to display in the UI
  dependsOn: string | [ string ]
  condition: string
  strategy:
    parallel: # parallel strategy
    matrix: # matrix strategy
    maxParallel: number # maximum number simultaneous matrix legs to run
    # note: `parallel` and `matrix` are mutually exclusive
    # you may specify one or the other; including both is an error
    # `maxParallel` is only valid with `matrix`
  continueOnError: boolean  # 'true' if future jobs should run even if this job fails; defaults to 'false'
  pool: pool # see pool schema
  workspace:
    clean: outputs | resources | all # what to clean up before the job runs
  container: containerReference # container to run this job inside
  timeoutInMinutes: number # how long to run the job before automatically cancelling
  cancelTimeoutInMinutes: number # how much time to give 'run always even if cancelled tasks' before killing them
  variables: { string: string } | [ variable | variableReference ] 
  steps: [ script | bash | pwsh | powershell | checkout | task | templateReference ]
  services: { string: string | container } # container resources to run as a service container
```

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="azure-devops"

If the primary intent of your job is to deploy your app (as opposed to build or test your app), then you can use a special type of job called **deployment job**.

The syntax for a deployment job is:

```yaml
- deployment: string        # instead of job keyword, use deployment keyword
  pool:
    name: string
    demands: string | [ string ]
  environment: string
  strategy:
    runOnce:
      deploy:
        steps:
        - script: echo Hi!
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="> azure-devops-2019"

Although you can add steps for deployment tasks in a `job`, we recommend that you instead use a [deployment job](deployment-jobs.md). A deployment job has a few benefits. For example, you can deploy to an environment, which includes benefits such as being able to see the history of what you've deployed.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

* **Agent pool jobs** run on an agent in an agent pool.
* **Server jobs** run on the Azure DevOps server.
* **Container jobs** run in a container on an agent in an agent pool. See [container jobs](container-phases.md) for more information.

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

* **Agent pool jobs** run on an agent in an agent pool.
* **Server jobs** run on the Azure DevOps server.
* **Deployment group jobs** run on machines in a deployment group. These jobs are only available in a release pipeline. See [deployment group jobs](deployment-group-phases.md) for more information.

### Agent pool jobs

These are the most common type of jobs and they run on an agent in an agent pool. 
Use demands to specify what capabilities an agent must have to run your job.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

```yaml
pool:
  name: myPrivateAgents    # your job runs on an agent in this pool
  demands: agent.os -equals Windows_NT    # the agent must have this capability to run the job
steps:
- script: echo hello world
```

Or multiple demands:

```yaml
pool:
  name: myPrivateAgents
  demands:
  - agent.os -equals Darwin
  - anotherCapability -equals somethingElse
steps:
- script: echo hello world
```

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"
YAML is not yet supported in TFS.
::: moniker-end

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
You have the option to specify demands in the pipeline, in the jobs, or both.
If you specify demands in both the pipeline and in a job, the union of the two sets of demands is required for the system to select an agent.

* * *
Learn more about [agent capabilities](../agents/agents.md#capabilities).

<h3 id ="server-jobs">Server jobs</h3>

Tasks in a server job are orchestrated by and executed on the server (Azure Pipelines or TFS). A server job does not require an agent or any target computers. Only a few tasks are supported in a server job at present.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The full syntax to specify a server job is:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: string
  timeoutInMinutes: number
  cancelTimeoutInMinutes: number
  strategy:
    maxParallel: number
    matrix: { string: { string: string } }

  pool: server
```

You can also use the simplified syntax:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: string
  pool: server
```

---

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

When you define multiple jobs in a single stage, you can specify dependencies between them.

> [!NOTE]
> Each agent can run only one job at a time. To run multiple jobs in parallel you must configure multiple agents. You also need sufficient [parallel jobs](../licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The syntax for defining multiple jobs and their dependencies is:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: string
  dependsOn: string
  condition: string
```

Example jobs that build sequentially:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Debug
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from the Debug build
- job: Release
  dependsOn: Debug
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from the Release build
```

Example jobs that build in parallel (no dependencies):

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Windows
  pool:
    vmImage: 'vs2017-win2016'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from Windows
- job: macOS
  pool:
    vmImage: 'macOS-10.13'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from macOS
- job: Linux
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from Linux
```

Example of fan out:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial job
- job: SubsequentA
  dependsOn: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent A
- job: SubsequentB
  dependsOn: InitialJob
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent B
```

Example of fan in:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: InitialA
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial A
- job: InitialB
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from initial B
- job: Subsequent
  dependsOn:
  - InitialA
  - InitialB
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from subsequent
```

To add a new job, select '...' on the pipeline channel in the **Tasks** tab of the pipeline. The conditions and order of execution for a job are displayed when you select the job in the editor.

::: moniker range="> tfs-2018"
When you specify multiple jobs in a build pipeline, they run in parallel by default. You can specify the order in which jobs must execute by configuring dependencies between jobs. Job dependencies are not yet supported in release pipelines. Multiple jobs in a release pipeline run in sequence.

Multiple jobs you add to a build or a release pipeline run in sequence. You cannot configure the order of dependencies between jobs in this version of TFS.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< tfs-2018"
Multiple jobs you add to a release pipeline run in sequence. You cannot configure the order of dependencies between jobs in this version of TFS. You cannot also use jobs with build pipelines.
::: moniker-end

For example, the pipeline shown below divides the overall release
execution into separate execution jobs by using two agent jobs
and a [server job](#server-jobs).

![Configuring a manual intervention step](_img/phases-02.png)

In the example above:

1. The tasks in the first job of the release run on an agent
   and, after this job is complete, the agent is released.

1. The server job contains a Manual Intervention task
   that runs on the Azure Pipelines or TFS.
   It does not execute on, or require, an agent or any target servers.
   The Manual Intervention task displays its message and waits for a
   "resume" or "reject" response from the user. In this example, if
   the configured timeout is reached, the task will
   automatically reject the deployment (set the timeout in the control options section to zero if
   you do not want an automated response to be generated).   

1. If the release is resumed, tasks in the third job run -
   possibly on a different agent. If the release is rejected,
   this job does not run and the release is marked as failed.

It's important to understand some of the consequences of
phased execution:

* Each job may use different
  agents. You should not assume that the state from an earlier
  job is available during subsequent jobs.

* The **Continue on Error** and **Always run** options for
  tasks in each job do not have any effect on tasks in
  subsequent jobs. For example, setting
  **Always run** on a task at the end of the first job will
  not guarantee that tasks in subsequent jobs will run.

* * *
<h2 id="conditions">Conditions</h2>

You can specify the conditions under which each job runs. By default, a job runs if it does not depend on any other job, or if all of the jobs that it depends on have completed and succeeded. You can customize this behavior by forcing a job to run even if a previous job fails or by specifying a custom condition.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

Example to run a job based upon the status of running a previous job:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  - script: exit 1

- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  condition: failed()
  steps:
  - script: echo this will run when A fails

- job: C
  dependsOn:
  - A
  - B
  condition: succeeded('B')
  steps:
  - script: echo this will run when B runs and succeeds
```

Example of using a [custom condition](conditions.md):

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  - script: echo hello

- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['build.sourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/master'))
  steps:
  - script: echo this only runs for master
```

You can specify that a job run based on the value of an output variable set in a previous job. In this case, you can only use variables set in directly dependent jobs:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  - script: "echo ##vso[task.setvariable variable=skipsubsequent;isOutput=true]false"
    name: printvar

- job: B
  condition: and(succeeded(), ne(dependencies.A.outputs['printvar.skipsubsequent'], 'true'))
  dependsOn: A
  steps:
  - script: echo hello from B
```

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

Use the **Run this job** option on an agent or server job to run the tasks
  only when specific [conditions](conditions.md) are met. Select a predefined
  condition, or select "custom" and enter an [expression](conditions.md) that evaluates
  to **true** or **false**. Nested expressions can be used, and the
  expressions can access variables available in the release pipeline.

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="< tfs-2018"
Conditions are not supported in this version of TFS.
::: moniker-end

* * *
<h2 id="timeouts">Timeouts</h2>

To avoid taking up resources when your job is hung or waiting too long, it's a good idea to set a limit on how long your job is allowed to run. Use the job timeout setting to specify the limit in minutes for running the job. Setting the value to **zero** means that the job can run:

* Forever on self-hosted agents
* For 360 minutes (6 hours) on Microsoft-hosted agents with a public project and public repository
* For 60 minutes on Microsoft-hosted agents with a private project or private repository

The timeout period begins when the job starts running. It does not include the
time the job is queued or is waiting for an agent.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The `timeoutInMinutes` allows a limit to be set for the job execution time. When not specified, the default is 60 minutes. When `0` is specified, the maximum limit is used (described above).

The `cancelTimeoutInMinutes` allows a limit to be set for the job cancel time. When not specified, the default is 5 minutes.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Test
  timeoutInMinutes: 10
  cancelTimeoutInMinutes: 2
```

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"
YAML is not yet supported in TFS.
::: moniker-end

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
Select the job and then specify the timeout value.

On the **Options** tab you can specify default values for all jobs in the pipeline. If you specify a non-zero value for the job timeout, then it overrides any value that is specified in the pipeline options. If you specify a zero value, then the timeout value from the pipeline options is used. If the pipeline value is also set to zero, then there is no timeout.

* * *
::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> Jobs targeting Microsoft-hosted agents have [additional restrictions](../agents/hosted.md) on how long they may run.

::: moniker-end

You can also set the timeout for each task individually - see [task control options](tasks.md#controloptions).

<a name="parallelexec"></a>

## Multi-configuration

From a single job you author, you can run multiple jobs on multiple agents in parallel. Some examples include:

* **Multi-configuration builds:** You can build multiple configurations in parallel. For
  example, you could build a Visual C++ app for both `debug` and `release` configurations on both `x86` and `x64` platforms. To learn more, see [Visual Studio Build - multiple configurations for multiple platforms](../tasks/build/visual-studio-build.md#multiconfiguration).

* **Multi-configuration deployments:** You can run multiple deployments
   in parallel, for example, to different geographic regions.

* **Multi-configuration testing:** You can run test multiple configurations in parallel.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The `matrix` strategy enables a job to be dispatched multiple times, with different variable sets. The `maxParallel` tag restricts the amount of parallelism. The following job will be dispatched three times with the values of Location and Browser set as specified. However, only two jobs will run at the same time.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Test
  strategy:
    maxParallel: 2
    matrix: 
      US_IE:
        Location: US
        Browser: IE
      US_Chrome:
        Location: US
        Browser: Chrome
      Europe_Chrome:
        Location: Europe
        Browser: Chrome
```

> [!NOTE]
> Matrix configuration names (like `US_IE` above) must contain only basic Latin alphabet letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers, and underscores (`_`).
> They must start with a letter.
> Also, they must be 100 characters or less.

It's also possible to use [output variables](variables.md#set-a-multi-job-output-variable) to generate a matrix.
This can be handy if you need to generate the matrix using a script.

`matrix` will accept a runtime expression containing a stringified JSON object.
That JSON object, when expanded, must match the matrixing syntax.
In the example below, we've hard-coded the JSON string, but it could be generated by a scripting language or command-line program.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: generator
  steps:
  - bash: echo "##vso[task.setVariable variable=legs;isOutput=true]{'a':{'myvar':'A'}, 'b':{'myvar':'B'}}"
    name: mtrx
  # This expands to the matrix
  #   a:
  #     myvar: A
  #   b:
  #     myvar: B
- job: runner
  dependsOn: generator
  strategy:
    matrix: $[ dependencies.generator.outputs['mtrx.legs'] ]
  steps:
  - script: echo $(myvar) # echos A or B depending on which leg is running
```

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
To run multiple jobs using multi-configuration option,
  you identify a variable named a **multiplier**, and specify a list
  of values for that multiplier. A separate job is run for each value
  in the list. To use multipliers for build or deployment, you must:

* Define one or more [variables](../release/variables.md)
  on the **Variables** tab of the pipeline or in a [variable group](../library/variable-groups.md).
  Each variable, known in this context as a _multiplier_ variable,
  must be defined as a comma-delimited list of the values you want
  to pass individually to the agents. 

* Enter the name of the multiplier variable, without the **$** and parentheses, as the
  value of the **Multipliers** parameter. Note that using a secret variable as a multiplier variable is not supported.

* If you want to execute the job for more than one multiplier variable, enter
  the variable names as a comma-delimited list - omitting the **$** and parentheses
  for each one.

* If you want to limit the number of agents used during the deployment to a
  number less than you have configured for your subscription, enter that value as the
  **Maximum number of agents** parameter.

For example, you might define two variables named **Location** and **Browser** as follows::

* **Location** = `US,Europe`
* **Browser** = `IE,Chrome,Edge,Firefox`

The following configuration will execute the deployment eight times using
a maximum of four agents at any one time:

* **Multipliers** = `Location,Browser`
* **Maximum number of agents** = `4`

With multi-configuration you can run multiple jobs, each with a different value for one or more variables (multipliers). If you want to run the same job on multiple agents, then you can use **multi-agent** option of parallelism. The test slicing example above can be accomplished through multi-agent option.

* * *
## Slicing

An agent job can be used to run a suite of tests in parallel. For example, you can run a large suite of 1000 tests on a single agent. Or, you can use two agents and run 500 tests on each one in parallel.
To leverage slicing, the tasks in the job should be smart enough to understand the slice they belong to.
The Visual Studio Test task is one such task that supports test slicing. If you have installed multiple agents, you can specify how the Visual Studio Test task will run in parallel on these agents.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The `parallel` strategy enables a job to be duplicated many times.
Variables `System.JobPositionInPhase` and `System.TotalJobsInPhase` are added to each job. The variables can then be used within your scripts to divide work among the jobs.
See [Parallel and multiple execution using agent jobs](#parallelexec).

The following job will be dispatched 5 times with the values of `System.JobPositionInPhase` and `System.TotalJobsInPhase` set appropriately.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Test
  strategy:
    parallel: 5
```

::: moniker-end

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
Specify the **multi-agent** option on an agent job to leverage slicing.
The job is dispatched as many times as the number of agents you specify,
and the variables `System.JobPositionInPhase` and `System.TotalJobsInPhase` are automatically set in each job.

* * *
## Job variables

If you are using YAML, variables can be specified on the job. The variables can be passed to task inputs using the macro syntax $(variableName), or accessed within a script using the stage variable.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

Here's an example of defining variables in a job and using them within tasks.

```yaml
variables:
  mySimpleVar: simple var value
  "my.dotted.var": dotted var value
  "my var with spaces": var with spaces value

steps:
- script: echo Input macro = $(mySimpleVar). Env var = %MYSIMPLEVAR%
  condition: eq(variables['agent.os'], 'Windows_NT')
- script: echo Input macro = $(mySimpleVar). Env var = $MYSIMPLEVAR
  condition: in(variables['agent.os'], 'Darwin', 'Linux')
- bash: echo Input macro = $(my.dotted.var). Env var = $MY_DOTTED_VAR
- powershell: Write-Host "Input macro = $(my var with spaces). Env var = $env:MY_VAR_WITH_SPACES"
```

## Workspace

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

When you run an agent pool job, it creates a workspace on the agent. The workspace is a directory in which it downloads the source, runs steps, and produces outputs. The workspace directory can be referenced in your job using `Pipeline.Workspace` variable. Under this, various sub-directories are created:

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"

When you run an agent pool job, it creates a workspace on the agent. The workspace is a directory in which it downloads the source, runs steps, and produces outputs. The workspace directory can be referenced in your job using `Agent.BuildDirectory` variable. Under this, various sub-directories are created:

::: moniker-end

- `Build.SourcesDirectory` is where tasks download the application's source code.
- `Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory` is where tasks download artifacts needed for the pipeline or upload artifacts before they are published.
- `Build.BinariesDirectory` is where tasks write their outputs.
- `Common.TestResultsDirectory` is where tasks upload their test results.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

When you run a pipeline on a self-hosted agent, by default, none of the sub-directories are cleaned in between two consecutive runs. As a results, you can do incremental builds and deployments, provided that tasks are implemented to make use of that. You can override this behavior using the `workspace` setting on the job.

```yaml
- job: myJob
  workspace:
    clean: outputs | resources | all # what to clean up before the job runs
```

When you specify one of the `clean` options, they are interpreted as follows:

- `outputs`: Delete `Build.BinariesDirectory` before running a new job.
- `resources`: Delete `Build.SourcesDirectory` before running a new job.
- `all`: Delete the entire `Pipeline.Workspace` directory before running a new job.

> [!NOTE]
>  `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` and `$(Common.TestResultsDirectory)` are always deleted and recreated prior to every build regardless of any of these settings.

## Artifact download

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

```yaml
# test and upload my code as an artifact named WebSite
jobs:
- job: Build
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'
  steps:
  - script: npm test
  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    inputs:
      pathtoPublish: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
      artifactName: WebSite

# download the artifact and deploy it only if the build job succeeded
- job: Deploy
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'
  steps:
  - checkout: none #skip checking out the default repository resource
  - task: DownloadBuildArtifacts@0
    displayName: 'Download Build Artifacts'
    inputs:
      artifactName: WebSite
      downloadPath: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)

  dependsOn: Build
  condition: succeeded()
```

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
In a release pipeline, you may choose to skip the
  [download of artifacts](../release/artifacts.md#download)
  during the job execution. Use this option if you want to implement
  your own custom logic for downloading artifacts by using tasks, or if the tasks in a particular job do not rely on the artifacts.

::: moniker range=">=tfs-2018"

Alternatively, you can choose to download specific [artifacts](../release/artifacts.md#download) during the job execution in a release. Use this option if the tasks in a particular job rely on only specific artifacts.

## Access to OAuth token

 You can allow scripts running in a job to access the current Azure Pipelines or TFS OAuth security token.
  The token can be use to authenticate to the Azure Pipelines REST API.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The OAuth token is always available to YAML pipelines.
It must be explicitly mapped into the task or step using `env`.
Here's an example:

```yaml
steps:
- powershell: |
    $url = "$($env:SYSTEM_TEAMFOUNDATIONCOLLECTIONURI)$env:SYSTEM_TEAMPROJECTID/_apis/build/definitions/$($env:SYSTEM_DEFINITIONID)?api-version=4.1-preview"
    Write-Host "URL: $url"
    $pipeline = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -Headers @{
      Authorization = "Bearer $env:TOKEN"
    }
    Write-Host "Pipeline = $($pipeline | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 100)"
  env:
    TOKEN: $(system.accesstoken)
```

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
Select the **Allow scripts to access OAuth token** option in the control options for the job.
