# Define approvals and checks

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

A pipeline is made up of stages. A pipeline author can control whether a stage should run by defining [conditions](conditions.md) on the stage. Another way to control if and when a stage should run is through **approvals and checks**. 

Approvals and other checks aren't defined in the yaml file. Users modifying the pipeline yaml file can't modify the checks performed before start of a stage. Administrators of resources manage checks using the web interface of Azure Pipelines.

Pipelines rely on resources such as environments, service connections, agent pools, variable groups, and secure files. Checks enable the _resource owner_ to control if and when a stage in any pipeline can consume a resource. As an owner of a resource, you can define checks that must be satisfied before a stage consuming that resource can start. For example, a _manual approval check_ on an [environment](environments.md) ensures that deployment to that environment only happens after the designated user  reviews the changes being deployed. 

A stage can consist of many jobs, and each job can consume several resources. Before the execution of a stage can begin, all checks on all the resources used in that stage must be satisfied. Azure Pipelines pauses the execution of a pipeline before each stage, and waits for all pending checks to be completed. 

There are five categories of approvals and checks and they run in the order they were created within each category. Checks are reevaluated based on the retry interval specified in each check. If all checks aren't successful until the **timeout** specified, then that stage isn't executed.
If any of the checks terminally fails (for example, if you reject an approval on one of the resources), then that stage isn't executed. 

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2022"
You can retry a stage when approvals and checks time out.
:::moniker-end

Static checks run first and then pre-check approvals run. The categories in order are:

1. Static checks: Branch control, Required template, and Evaluate artifact
2. Pre-check approvals
3. Dynamic checks: Approval, Invoke Azure Function, Invoke REST API, Business Hours, Query Azure Monitor alerts
4. Post-check approvals
5. Exclusive lock 

You can also see the execution order on the **Approvals and checks** tab.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Checks can be configured on environments, service connections, repositories, variable groups, secure files, and agent pools.
> 
> Service connections cannot be specified by variable.

## Approvals

You can manually control when a stage should run using approval and checks. This check is commonly used to control deployments to production environments.

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Pipelines** > **Environments**, and then select your environment. 

1. Select the **Approvals and checks** tab, and then select the **+** sign to add a new check.

    :::image type="content" source="media/add-approvals-and-checks.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to add approvals and checks in Azure Pipelines.":::

1. Select **Approvals**, and then select **Next**.

1. Add users or groups as your designated **Approvers**, and, if desired, provide **instructions for the approvers**. Specify if you want to permit or restrict approvers from approving their own runs, and specify your desired **Timeout**. If approvals aren't completed within the specified Timeout, the stage is marked as skipped.

1. Select **Create** when you're done.

    :::image type="content" source="media/create-new-approval.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to create a new approval.":::

1. Once the approval check is triggered, a prompt window, as shown in the following example, is presented in the user interface. This window provides the option for approvers to either reject or approve the run, along with any accompanying instructions.

    :::image type="content" source="media/approval-prompt.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the approval prompt window.":::

The list of users who can review an Approval is fixed at the time approvals & checks start running. That is, changes to the list of users and groups of an approval check done after checks start executing aren't picked up.

> [!NOTE]
> If a group is designated as an approver, only one user within the group needs to approve for the run to proceed.

### Deferred approvals

There are situations when the time when an approval is given and the time the deployment should start don't match. For example, you might want to wait to deploy a new release until a low-traffic time in the evening. 

To address this scenario, you can defer an approval and set the time the approval becomes effective. 

1. Select **Defer approval**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/defer-approval.png" alt-text="Screenshot of defer approval option when you respond to an approval request. ":::

1. Set the approval time. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/defer-approval-set-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot of setting the time for an approval. ":::

You'll see the approval in the **Checks** panel as a pre-approval. The approval is effective at the set time. 

::: moniker-end

## Branch control

Using the branch control check, you can ensure all the resources linked with the pipeline are built from the **allowed** branches and that the branches have protection enabled. This check helps in controlling the release readiness and quality of deployments. In case multiple resources are linked with the pipeline, source for all the resources is verified. If you've linked another pipeline, then the branch of the specific run being deployed is verified for protection.

To define the branch control check:

1. In your Azure DevOps project, go to the resource (for example, environment) that needs to be protected. 

2. Navigate to **Approvals and Checks** for the resource.

3. Choose the **Branch control** check and provide a comma-separated list of allowed branches. You can mandate that the branch should have protection enabled. You can also define the behavior of the check if the protection status for one of the branches isn't known. A branch is considered protected if at least one policy has been applied (including policies applied at the repository level).

    :::image type="content" source="media/checks/branch-control-check.png" alt-text="Configuring branch control check.":::

At run time, the check would validate branches for all linked resources in the run against the allowed list. If any of the branches doesn't match the criteria, the check fails and the stage is marked failed. 

> [!NOTE]
> The check requires the branch names to be fully qualified. Make sure the format for branch name is `refs/heads/<branch name>`

## Business hours

In case you want all deployments to your environment to happen in a specific time window only, then business hours check is the ideal solution. When you run a pipeline, the execution of the stage that uses the resource waits for business hours. If you have multiple runs executing simultaneously, each of them is independently verified. At the start of the business hours, the check is marked successful for all the runs. 

:::image type="content" source="media/checks/business-hours-check.png" alt-text="Configuring business hours check.":::

If execution of the stage hasn't started at the end of business hours (held up by to some other check), then the business hours approval is automatically withdrawn and a reevaluation is scheduled for the next day.
The check fails if execution of the stage doesn't start within the **Timeout** period specified for the check, and the stage is marked as  failed.

## Invoke Azure function

Azure functions are the serverless computation platform offered by Azure. With Azure functions, you can run small pieces of code (called "functions") without worrying about application infrastructure. 
Given the high flexibility, Azure functions provide a great way to author your own checks. You include the logic of the check-in Azure function such that each execution is triggered on http request, has a short execution time, and returns a response. While defining the check, you can parse the response body to infer if the check is successful. The evaluation can be repeated periodically using the Time between evaluations setting in control options. [Learn More](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-function-v1)

:::image type="content" source="media/checks/azure-function-check.png" alt-text="Configuring Azure function check.":::

If your check doesn't succeed within the configured **Timeout**, the associated stage is skipped. Stages depending on it are skipped as well. For more information, see the [Azure Function App task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-function-app-v1).

> [!NOTE]
> User defined pipeline variables are accessible to the check starting with [Sprint 215](/azure/devops/release-notes/2023/sprint-215-update#variables-as-inputs-in-checks).

[Read more about the recommended way to use invoke Azure function checks](invoke-checks.md). Checks [need to follow specific rules](invoke-checks.md#check-compliance) depending on their mode and the number of retries to be compliant. 

## Invoke REST API

Invoke REST API check enables you to integrate with any of your existing services. Periodically, make a call to a REST API and continue if it returns a successful response. [Learn More](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/invoke-rest-api-v1)

The evaluation can be repeated periodically using the **Time between evaluations** setting in control options. If your check doesn't succeed within the configured **Timeout**, the associated stage is skipped. Stages depending on it are skipped as well. For more information, see [Invoke REST API task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/invoke-rest-api-v1).

> [!NOTE]
> User defined pipeline variables are accessible to the check starting with [Sprint 215](/azure/devops/release-notes/2023/sprint-215-update#variables-as-inputs-in-checks).

[Read more about the recommended way to use invoke REST API checks](invoke-checks.md).

## Query Azure Monitor Alerts
Azure Monitor offers visualization, query, routing, alerting, autoscale, and automation on data from the Azure infrastructure and each individual Azure resource. Alerts are a standard means to detect issues with the health of infrastructure or application, and take corrective actions. 
Canary deployments and staged rollouts are common deployment strategies used to lower risk of regressions to critical applications. After deploying to a stage (set of customers), the application is observed for a period of time. Health of the application after deployment is used to decide whether the update should be made to the next stage or not.

Query Azure Monitor Alerts helps you observe Azure Monitor and ensure no alerts are raised for the application after a deployment. The check succeeds if no alert rules are activated at the time of evaluation. [Learn More](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-monitor-v1)

The evaluation is repeated after **Time between evaluations** setting in control options. The checks fail if the stage hasn't started execution within the specified **Timeout** period.  

## Required template

With the required template check, you can enforce pipelines to use a specific YAML template. When this check is in place, a pipeline fails if it doesn't extend from the referenced template. 

To define a required template approval:

1. In your Azure DevOps project, go to the [service connection](../library/service-endpoints.md) that you want to restrict. 

2. Open **Approvals and Checks** in the menu next to **Edit**. 

3. In the **Add your first check** menu, select  **Required template**. 

4. Enter details on how to get to your required template file. 
    * **Repository type**: The location of your repository (GitHub, Azure, or Bitbucket).
    * **Repository**: The name of your repository that contains your template. 
    * **Ref**: The branch or tag of the required template. 
    * **Path to required template**: The name of your template. 


You can have multiple required templates for the same service connection. In this example, the required template is `production_template.yaml`.

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2022"


## Disable a check

When debugging a check, you might want to temporarily disable and then enable it again. To disable or enable a check:

1. In your Azure DevOps project, go to the resource with a check.  

2. Open the **Approvals and Checks** tab. 

3. In the contextual menu, select **Disable** or **Enable**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/checks/disable-check-approvals.png" alt-text="Screenshot of disable a check option.":::


## Bypass a check

In some circumstances such as a hotfix deployment, you may need to bypass a check. You can only bypass a check only if you have the administrator permission for the resource where the check is defined. 

To bypass an approval, business hours, invoke Azure function, or invoke REST API check, select **Bypass check** when the resource is waiting for review. Here's an example of bypassing the business hours check. 

:::image type="content" source="media/bypass-business-hours-check.png" alt-text="Screenshot of bypass business hours check option. ":::

When you bypass a check, you'll see who bypassed the check in the checks panel. 

:::image type="content" source="media/check-bypass-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot of log of bypassed check. ":::

::: moniker-end

## Evaluate artifact

You can evaluate artifacts to be deployed to an environment against custom policies.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, this works with container image artifacts only

To define a custom policy evaluation over the artifacts, follow the below steps.

1. In your Azure DevOps Services project, navigate to the environment that needs to be protected. Learn more about [creating an environment](environments.md).

    :::image type="content" source="media/checks/environments.png" alt-text="View environment.":::


2. Navigate to **Approvals and checks** for the environment.

    :::image type="content" source="media/checks/approvals-and-checks.png" alt-text="Add checks to environment.":::

3. Select **Evaluate artifact**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/checks/evaluate-artifact.png" alt-text="Add evaluate artifact check.":::
   
4. Paste the policy definition and select **Save**. [See more](artifact-policy.md) about writing policy definitions.

    :::image type="content" source="media/checks/policy-definition.png" alt-text="Add policy definition.":::
 
When you run a pipeline, the execution of that run pauses before entering a stage that uses the environment. The specified policy is evaluated against the available image metadata. The check passes when the policy is successful and fails otherwise. The stage is marked failed if the check fails.

### [Passed](#tab/check-pass)

## Exclusive lock

:::moniker range="> azure-devops-2020"

The **exclusive lock** check allows only a single run from the pipeline to proceed and can be set at the stage or pipeline level. All stages in all runs of that pipeline that use the resource are paused. When the stage using the lock completes, then another stage can proceed to use the resource. Also, only one stage is allowed to continue.

The `lockBehavior` property determines how other stages handle locks. When you specify the `lockBehavior` property for a stage, a lock is automatically created for that stage. There are two possible `lockBehavior` values:

* `runLatest` - Only the latest run acquires the lock to the resource. `runLatest` is the default if no `lockBehavior` is specified.
* `sequential` - All runs acquire the lock to the protected resource sequentially.

To use an exclusive lock check with `sequential` deployments or `runLatest`, follow these steps:

 1. Enable the exclusive lock check on the environment (or another protected resource). The exclusive lock option is an available check. 
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/exclusive-lock-option.png" alt-text="Screenshot of exclusive lock option Approvals tab. ":::

 1. In the YAML file for the pipeline, specify a property called `lockBehavior`. This can be specified for the whole [pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/pipeline) or for a given [stage](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/stages-stage):

Set on a stage:

```yaml
stages:
- stage: A
  lockBehavior: sequential
  jobs:
  - deployment: DeployWeb
    displayName: deploy Web App
    pool:
      vmImage: 'Ubuntu-latest'
    # environment on which Exclusive lock is enabled
    environment: 
      name: 'smarthotel-dev'
      resourceName: myVM
      resourceType: virtualMachine
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: Hey!
```
Set on the pipeline:

```yaml
lockBehavior: runLatest
stages:
- stage: A
 jobs:
 - deployment: DeployWeb
    displayName: deploy Web App
    pool:
      vmImage: 'Ubuntu-latest'
    # environment on which Exclusive lock is enabled
    environment: 
      name: 'smarthotel-dev'
      resourceName: myVM
      resourceType: virtualMachine
    strategy:
      runOnce:
        deploy:
          steps:
          - script: Hey!
    
```

If you don't specify a `lockBehavior` and a lock is set on a resource, the default value of `runLatest` is used. 

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="=azure-devops-2020"

The **exclusive lock** check allows only a single run from the pipeline to proceed.
All stages in all runs of that pipeline that use the resource are paused.
When the stage using the lock completes, then another stage can proceed to use the resource.
Also, only one stage is allowed to continue.
Any other stages that tried to take the lock will be canceled.

:::moniker-end

## ServiceNow Change Management

**This checks needs the [ServiceNow Change Management extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.vss-services-servicenowchangerequestmanagement) to be installed from the marketplace**

The **servicenow change management** check allows for an integration of ServiceNow change management process in the pipelines. 
By adding the check, a new change request in ServiceNow can be automatically created at the start of the stage. The pipeline waits for the change process to complete before starting the stage.
More details are available [here](../release/approvals/servicenow.md).


## Multiple Approvals and Checks

A stage can consist of many jobs, and each job can consume several resources. Before the execution of a stage can begin, all checks on all the resources used in that stage must be satisfied. Azure Pipelines pauses the execution of a pipeline prior to each stage, and waits for all pending checks to be completed.

A single final negative decision causes the pipeline to be denied access and the stage to fail. The decisions of all approvals and checks except for invoke Azure function / REST API and [Exclusive lock](#exclusive-lock) are final. You can rerun successful invoke Azure function / REST API checks. 

When using invoke Azure function / REST API checks in the [recommended way](invoke-checks.md), their access decisions are also final. 

When you specify _Time between evaluations_ for an invoke Azure function / REST API check to be non-zero, the check's decision is non-final. This scenario is worth exploring. 

Let us look at an example. Imagine your YAML pipeline has a stage that uses a service connection. This service connection has two checks configured for it:
1. An asynchronous check, named _External Approval Granted_, that verifies that [an external approval is given](invoke-checks.md#external-approval-must-be-granted) and is configured in the recommended way.
1. A synchronous check, named _Deployment Reason Valid_, that verifies that [the deployment reason is valid](invoke-checks.md#deployment-reason-must-be-valid) and for which you set the _Time between evaluations_ to 7 minutes.

A possible checks execution is shown in the following diagram.
:::image type="content" source="media/checks/checks-timeline.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the timeline of an asynchronous and a synchronous check's executions.":::

In this execution:
- Both checks, _External Approval Granted_ and _Deployment Reason Valid_, are invoked at the same time. _Deployment Reason Valid_ fails immediately, but because _External Approval Granted_ is pending, it is retried. 
- At minute 7, _Deployment Reason Valid_ is retried and this time it passes. 
- At minute 15, _External Approval Granted_ calls back into Azure Pipelines with a successful decision. Now, both checks pass, so the pipeline is allowed to continue to deploy the stage.

Let us look at another example, involving two synchronous checks. Assume your YAML pipeline has a stage that uses a service connection. This service connection has two checks configured for it:
1. A synchronous check, named _Sync Check 1_, for which you set the _Time between evaluations_ to 5 minutes.
1. A synchronous check, named _Sync Check 2_, for which you set the _Time between evaluations_ to 7 minutes.

A possible checks execution is shown in the following diagram.
:::image type="content" source="media/checks/checks-timeline-sync.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows the timeline of two synchronous checks' executions.":::

In this execution:
- Both checks, _Sync Check 1_ and _Sync Check 2_, are invoked at the same time. _Sync Check 1_ passes, but it is retried, because _Sync Check 2_ fails. 
- At minute 5, _Sync Check 1_ is retried but fails, so it is retried.
- At minute 7, _Sync Check 2_ is retried and succeeds. The pass decision is valid for 7 minutes. If _Sync Check 1_ doesn't pass in this time interval, _Sync Check 2_ is retried.
- At minute 10, _Sync Check 1_ is retried but fails, so it is retried.
- At minute 14, _Sync Check 2_ is retried and succeeds. The pass decision is valid for 7 minutes. If _Sync Check 1_ doesn't pass in this time interval, _Sync Check 2_ is retried.
- At minute 15, _Sync Check 1_ is retried and succeeds. Now, both checks pass, so the pipeline is allowed to continue to deploy the stage.

Let us look at an example that involves an approval and a synchronous check. Imagine you configured a synchronous check and an approval for a service connection with a _Time between evaluations_ of 5 minutes. Until the approval is given, your check runs every 5 minutes, regardless of decision.

## FAQ

### The checks defined didn't start. What happened?
The evaluation of checks starts once the stage conditions are satisfied. You should confirm run of the stage started after the checks were added on the resource and that the resource is consumed in the stage.

### How can I use checks for scheduling a stage?
Using the business hours check, you can control the time for start of stage execution. You can achieve the same behavior as [predefined schedule on a stage](../release/triggers.md#scheduled-release-triggers) in designer releases. 

### How can I take advance approvals for a stage scheduled to run in future?
This scenario can be enabled. 
1.	The business hours check enables all stages deploying to a resource to be scheduled for execution between the time window
2.	When approvals are configured on the same resource, the stage would wait for approvals before starting.
3.	You can configure both the checks on a resource. The stage would wait on approvals and business hours. It would start in the next scheduled window after approvals are complete. 

### Can I wait for completion of security scanning on the artifact being deployed?
In order to wait for completion of security scanning on the artifact being deployed, you would need to use an external scanning service like AquaScan. The artifact being deployed would need to be uploaded at a location accessible to the scanning service before the start of checks, and can be identified using [predefined variables](../build/variables.md?tabs=yaml#build-variables).
Using the Invoke REST API check, you can add a check to wait on the API in the security service and pass the artifact identifier as an input.

### How can I use output variables from previous stages in a check?
By default, only predefined variables are available to checks. You can use a linked variable group to access other variables. The output variable from the previous stage can be written to the variable group and accessed in the check.
