# Define variables

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/concept-rename-note.md)]

Variables give you a convenient way to get key bits of data into various parts of the pipeline. The most common use of variables is to define a value that you can then use in your pipeline. All variables are stored as strings and are mutable. The value of a variable can change from run to run or job to job of your pipeline.

When you define the same variable in multiple places with the same name, the most locally scoped variable wins. So, a variable defined at the job level can override a variable set at the stage level. A variable defined at the stage level will override a variable set at the pipeline root level. A variable set in the pipeline root level will override a variable set in the Pipeline settings UI. 

You can use variables with [expressions](expressions.md) to conditionally assign values and further customize pipelines.

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"
Variables are different from [runtime parameters](runtime-parameters.md), which are typed and available during template parsing. 
::: moniker-end

## User-defined variables

When you define a variable, you can use [different syntaxes (macro, template expression, or runtime)](#understand-variable-syntax) and what syntax you use will determine where in the pipeline your variable will render.

In YAML pipelines, you can set variables at the root, stage, and job level. You can also specify variables outside of a YAML pipeline in the UI. When you set a variable in the UI, that variable can be encrypted and set as secret. <a href="#secret-variables">Secret variables</a> are not automatically decrypted in YAML pipelines and need to be passed to your YAML file with `env:` or a variable at the root level. 

User-defined variables can be [set as read-only](../security/inputs.md). There are [naming restrictions for variables](#variable-naming-restrictions) (example: you can't use `secret` at the start of a variable name).

You can [use a variable group](../library/variable-groups.md) to make variables available across multiple pipelines.  

You can use [templates](templates.md) to define variables that are used in multiple pipelines in one file. 

## System variables

In addition to user-defined variables, Azure Pipelines has system variables with predefined values. If you are using YAML or classic build pipelines, see [predefined variables](../build/variables.md) for a comprehensive list of system variables. 
If you are using classic release pipelines, see [release variables](../release/variables.md).

System variables are set with their current value when you run the pipeline. Some variables are set automatically. As a pipeline author or end user, you change the value of a system variable before the pipeline is run. 

System variables are read-only. 

## Environment variables

Environment variables are specific to the operating system you are using. They are injected into a pipeline in platform-specific ways. The format corresponds to how environment variables get formatted for your specific scripting platform. 

 On UNIX systems (macOS and Linux), environment variables have the format `$NAME`. On Windows, the format is `%NAME%` for batch and `$env:NAME` in PowerShell.

System and user-defined variables also get injected as environment variables for your platform.  When variables are turned into environment variables, variable names become uppercase, and periods turn into underscores. For example, the variable name `any.variable` becomes the variable name `$ANY_VARIABLE`.

## Variable naming restrictions

User-defined variables can consist of letters, numbers, `.`, and `_` characters. Don't use variable prefixes that are reserved by the system. These are: `endpoint`, `input`, `secret`, and `securefile`. Any variable that begins with one of these strings (regardless of capitalization) will not be available to your tasks and scripts. 

## Understand variable syntax

Azure Pipelines supports three different ways to reference variables: macro, template expression, and runtime expression. Each syntax can be used for a different purpose and has some limitations. 

In a pipeline, template expression variables (`${{ variables.var }}`) get processed at compile time, before runtime starts. Macro syntax variables (`$(var)`) get processed during runtime before a task runs. Runtime expressions (`$[variables.var]`) also get processed during runtime but were designed for use with [conditions](conditions.md) and [expressions](expressions.md). When you use a runtime expression, it must take up the entire right side of a definition. 

In this example, you can see that the template expression still has the initial value of the variable after the variable is updated. The value of the macro syntax variable updates. The template expression value does not change because all template expression variables get processed at compile time before tasks run. In contrast, macro syntax variables are evaluated before each task runs. 

```yaml
variables:
- name: one
  value: initialValue 

steps:
  - script: |
      echo ${{ variables.one }} # outputs initialValue
      echo $(one)
    displayName: First variable pass
  - bash: echo '##vso[task.setvariable variable=one]secondValue'
    displayName: Set new variable value
  - script: |
      echo ${{ variables.one }} # outputs initialValue
      echo $(one) # outputs secondValue
    displayName: Second variable pass
```

### Macro syntax variables
Most documentation examples use macro syntax (`$(var)`). Macro syntax is designed to interpolate variable values into task inputs and into other variables. 

Variables with macro syntax get processed before a task executes during runtime. Runtime happens [after template expansion](runs.md#process-the-pipeline). When the system encounters a macro expression, it replaces the expression with the contents of the variable. If there's no variable by that name, then the macro expression is left unchanged. For example, if `$(var)` can't be replaced, `$(var)` won't be replaced by anything. 

Macro syntax variables remain unchanged with no value because an empty value like `$()` might mean something to the task you are running and the agent should not assume you want that value replaced.  For example, if you use `$(foo)` to reference variable `foo` in a Bash task, replacing all `$()` expressions in the input to the task could break your Bash scripts.

Macro variables are only expanded when they are used for a value, not as a keyword. Values appear on the right side of a pipeline definition. The following is valid: `key: $(value)`. The following isn't valid: `$(key): value`. Macro variables are not expanded when used to display a job name inline. Instead, you must use the `displayName` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Variables are only expanded for `stages`, `jobs`, and `steps`.
> You cannot, for example, use macro syntax inside a `resource` or `trigger`.

In this example, macro syntax is used with Bash, PowerShell, and a script task. The syntax for calling a variable with macro syntax is the same for all three. 

 ```yaml
variables:
  - name: projectName
    value: contoso

steps: 
- bash: echo $(projectName)
- powershell: echo $(projectName)
- script: echo $(projectName)
 ```

### Template expression syntax 
You can use template expression syntax to expand both [template parameters](../process/templates.md) and variables (`${{ variables.var }}`). Template variables are processed at compile time, and are replaced before runtime starts. Template expressions are designed for reusing parts of YAML as templates. 

 Template variables silently coalesce to empty strings when a replacement value isn't found. Template expressions, unlike macro and runtime expressions, can appear as either keys (left side) or values (right side). The following is valid: `${{ variables.key }} : ${{ variables.value }}`.

### Runtime expression syntax
You can use runtime expression syntax for variables that are expanded at runtime (`$[variables.var]`). Runtime expression variables silently coalesce to empty strings when a replacement value isn't found. Runtime expressions are designed to be used in the conditions of jobs, to support conditional execution of jobs, or whole stages.

Runtime expression variables are only expanded when they are used for a value, not as a keyword. Values appear on the right side of a pipeline definition. The following is valid: `key: $[variables.value]`. The following isn't valid: `$[variables.key]: value`. The runtime expression must take up the entire right side of a key-value pair. For example, `key: $[variables.value]` is valid but `key: $[variables.value] foo` is not. 

|Syntax|Example|When is it processed?|Where does it expand in a pipeline definition?|How does it render when not found?|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|macro|`$(var)`|runtime before a task executes|value (right side)|prints `$(var)`|
|template expression|`${{ variables.var }}`|compile time|key or value (left or right side)|empty string|
|runtime expression|`$[variables.var]`|runtime|value (right side)|empty string|

### What syntax should I use?

Use macro syntax if you are providing input for a task. 

Choose a runtime expression if you are working with [conditions](conditions.md) and [expressions](expressions.md). The exception to this is if you have a pipeline where it will cause a problem for your empty variable to print out. For example, if you have conditional logic that relies on a variable having a specific value or no value. In that case, you should use a runtime expression. 

If you are defining a variable in a template, use a template expression.

## Set variables in pipeline

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

In the most common case, you set the variables and use them within the YAML file. This allows you to track changes to the variable in your version control system. You can also define variables in the pipeline settings UI (see the Classic tab) and reference them in your YAML. 

Here's an example that shows how to set two variables, `configuration` and `platform`, and use them later in steps. To use a variable in a YAML statement, wrap it in `$()`. Variables can't be used to define a `repository` in a YAML statement. 

```yaml
# Set variables once
variables:
  configuration: debug
  platform: x64

steps:

# Use them once
- task: MSBuild@1
  inputs:
    solution: solution1.sln
    configuration: $(configuration) # Use the variable
    platform: $(platform)

# Use them again
- task: MSBuild@1
  inputs:
    solution: solution2.sln
    configuration: $(configuration) # Use the variable
    platform: $(platform)
```

### Variable scopes

In the YAML file, you can set a variable at various scopes:

- At the root level, to make it available to all jobs in the pipeline.
- At the stage level, to make it available only to a specific stage.
- At the job level, to make it available only to a specific job.

When a variable is defined at the top of a YAML, it will be available to all jobs and stages in the pipeline and is a global variable. Global variables defined in a YAML are not visible in the pipeline settings UI. 

Variables at the job level override variables at the root and stage level. Variables at the stage level override variables at the root level. 

```yaml
variables:
  global_variable: value    # this is available to all jobs

jobs:
- job: job1
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'
  variables:
    job_variable1: value1    # this is only available in job1
  steps:
  - bash: echo $(global_variable)
  - bash: echo $(job_variable1)
  - bash: echo $JOB_VARIABLE1 # variables are available in the script environment too

- job: job2
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'
  variables:
    job_variable2: value2    # this is only available in job2
  steps:
  - bash: echo $(global_variable)
  - bash: echo $(job_variable2)
  - bash: echo $GLOBAL_VARIABLE
```

### Specify variables

In the preceding examples, the `variables` keyword is followed by a list of key-value pairs.
The keys are the variable names and the values are the variable values.

There is another syntax, useful when you want to use [variable templates](templates.md) or [variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md). This syntax should be used at the root level of a pipeline. 


In this alternate syntax, the `variables` keyword takes a list of variable specifiers.
The variable specifiers are `name` for a regular variable, `group` for a variable group, and `template` to include a variable template.
The following example demonstrates all three.

```yaml
variables:
# a regular variable
- name: myvariable
  value: myvalue
# a variable group
- group: myvariablegroup
# a reference to a variable template
- template: myvariabletemplate.yml
```

<h2 id="secret-variables">Set secret variables</h2>

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

Don't set secret variables in your YAML file. Operating systems often log commands for the processes that they run, and you wouldn't want the log to include a secret that you passed in as an input. Use the script's environment or map the variable within the `variables` block to pass secrets to your pipeline.

You need to set secret variables in the pipeline settings UI for your pipeline. These variables are scoped to the pipeline in which you set them. You can also set [secret variables in variable groups](#reference-secret-variables-in-variable-groups). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/set-secrets.md)]

The following example shows how to use a secret variable called `mySecret` in PowerShell and Bash scripts.
Unlike a normal pipeline variable, there's no environment variable called `MYSECRET`.

```yaml
variables:
 GLOBAL_MYSECRET: $(mySecret) # this will not work because the secret variable needs to be mapped as env
 GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(nonSecretVariable) # this works because it's not a secret.
 
steps:

- powershell: |
    Write-Host "Using an input-macro works: $(mySecret)"
    Write-Host "Using the env var directly does not work: $env:MYSECRET"
    Write-Host "Using a global secret var mapped in the pipeline does not work either: $env:GLOBAL_MYSECRET"
    Write-Host "Using a global non-secret var mapped in the pipeline works: $env:GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR" 
    Write-Host "Using the mapped env var for this task works and is recommended: $env:MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(mySecret) # the recommended way to map to an env variable

- bash: |
    echo "Using an input-macro works: $(mySecret)"
    echo "Using the env var directly does not work: $MYSECRET"
    echo "Using a global secret var mapped in the pipeline does not work either: $GLOBAL_MYSECRET"
    echo "Using a global non-secret var mapped in the pipeline works: $GLOBAL_MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR" 
    echo "Using the mapped env var for this task works and is recommended: $MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR"
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_ENV_VAR: $(mySecret) # the recommended way to map to an env variable


```

The output from both tasks in the preceding script would look like this:

```text
Using an input-macro works: ***
Using the env var directly does not work:
Using a global secret var mapped in the pipeline does not work either:
Using a global non-secret var mapped in the pipeline works: foo
Using the mapped env var for this task works and is recommended: ***
```
You can also use secret variables outside of scripts. For example, you can map secret variables to tasks using the `variables` definition. This example shows how to use secret variables `$(vmsUser)` and `$(vmsAdminPass)` in an Azure file copy task. 

```yaml
variables:
  VMS_USER: $(vmsUser)
  VMS_PASS: $(vmsAdminPass)

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: AzureFileCopy@4
  inputs:
    SourcePath: 'my/path'
    azureSubscription: 'my-subscription'
    Destination: 'AzureVMs'
    storage: 'my-storage'
    resourceGroup: 'my-rg'
    vmsAdminUserName: $(VMS_USER)
    vmsAdminPassword: $(VMS_PASS)
```


### Reference secret variables in variable groups

This example shows how to reference a variable group in your YAML file, and also add variables within the YAML. There are two variables used from the variable group: `user` and `token`. The `token` variable is secret, and is mapped to the environment variable `$env:MY_MAPPED_TOKEN` so that it can be referenced in the YAML. 

This YAML makes a REST call to retrieve a list of releases, and outputs the result. 

```yaml
variables: 
- group: 'my-var-group' # variable group
- name: 'devopsAccount' # new variable defined in YAML
  value: 'contoso'
- name: 'projectName' # new variable defined in YAML
  value: 'contosoads'

steps:
- task: PowerShell@2
  inputs:
    targetType: 'inline'
    script: |
        # Encode the Personal Access Token (PAT)
        # $env:USER is a normal variable in the variable group
        # $env:MY_MAPPED_TOKEN is a mapped secret variable
        $base64AuthInfo = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(("{0}:{1}" -f $env:USER,$env:MY_MAPPED_TOKEN)))
        
        # Get a list of releases
        $uri = "https://vsrm.dev.azure.com/$(devopsAccount)/$(projectName)/_apis/release/releases?api-version=5.1"

        # Invoke the REST call
        $result = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Get -ContentType "application/json" -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)}
        
        # Output releases in JSON
        Write-Host $result.value
  env:
    MY_MAPPED_TOKEN: $(token) # Maps the secret variable $(token) from my-var-group

```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, each stage in a pipeline depends on the one just before it in the YAML file. If you need to refer to a stage that isn't immediately prior to the current one, you can override this automatic default by adding a `dependsOn` section to the stage.

> [!NOTE]
> The following examples use standard pipeline syntax. If you're using deployment pipelines, both variable and conditional variable syntax will differ. For information about the specific syntax to use, see [Deployment jobs](deployment-jobs.md).

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

For these examples, assume we have a task called `MyTask`, which sets an output variable called `MyVar`.
Learn more about the syntax in [Expressions - Dependencies](expressions.md#dependencies).

### Use outputs in the same job

```yaml
steps:
- task: MyTask@1  # this step generates the output variable
  name: ProduceVar  # because we're going to depend on it, we need to name the step
- script: echo $(ProduceVar.MyVar) # this step uses the output variable
```

### Use outputs in a different job

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  steps:
  # assume that MyTask generates an output variable called "MyVar"
  # (you would learn that from the task's documentation)
  - task: MyTask@1
    name: ProduceVar  # because we're going to depend on it, we need to name the step
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  variables:
    # map the output variable from A into this job
    varFromA: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['ProduceVar.MyVar'] ]
  steps:
  - script: echo $(varFromA) # this step uses the mapped-in variable
```
::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"

### Use outputs in a different stage

To use the output from a different stage at the job level, you use the `stageDependencies` syntax.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: One
  jobs:
  - job: A
    steps:
    - task: MyTask@1  # this step generates the output variable
      name: ProduceVar  # because we're going to depend on it, we need to name the step
- stage: Two
  - job: B
    variables:
      # map the output variable from A into this job
      varFromA: $[ stageDependencies.One.A.outputs['ProduceVar.MyVar'] ]
    steps:
    - script: echo $(varFromA) # this step uses the mapped-in variable
```

You can also pass variables between stages with a file input. To do so, you'll need to define variables in the second stage at the job level and then pass the variables as `env:` inputs. 

```bash
## script-a.sh
echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=sauce;isOutput=true]crushed tomatoes"
```

```bash
## script-b.sh
echo 'Hello file version'
echo $skipMe
echo $StageSauce
```

```yaml
## azure-pipelines.yml
stages:

- stage: one
  jobs:
  - job: A
    steps:
    - task: Bash@3
      inputs:
          filePath: 'script-a.sh'
      name: setvar
    - bash: |
       echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=skipsubsequent;isOutput=true]true"
      name: skipstep
  
- stage: two
  jobs:
  - job: B
    variables:
      - name: StageSauce
        value: $[ stageDependencies.one.A.outputs['setvar.sauce'] ]
      - name: skipMe
        value: $[ stageDependencies.one.A.outputs['skipstep.skipsubsequent'] ]
    steps:
    - task: Bash@3
      inputs:
        filePath: 'script-b.sh'
      name: fileversion
      env:
        StageSauce: $(StageSauce) # predefined in variables section
        skipMe: $(skipMe) # predefined in variables section
    - task: Bash@3
      inputs:
        targetType: 'inline'
        script: |
          echo 'Hello inline version'
          echo $(skipMe) 
          echo $(StageSauce) 
```

### Use outputs in the same job

In the **Output variables** section, give the producing task a reference name.
Then, in a downstream step, you can use the form `$(<ReferenceName>.<VariableName>)` to refer to output variables. 

### Use outputs in a different job

You must use YAML to consume output variables in a different job.

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli/)

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"
There is no [**az pipelines**](/cli/azure/pipelines) command that applies to using output variables from tasks. The Azure DevOps CLI commands are only valid for Azure DevOps Services (cloud service).

## List variables

You can list all of the variables in your pipeline with the [az pipelines variable list](/cli/azure/pipelines/variable#ext-azure-devops-az-pipelines-variable-list) command. To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).

```azurecli 
az pipelines variable list [--org]
                           [--pipeline-id]
                           [--pipeline-name]
                           [--project]
``` 

#### Parameters 

- **org**: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization using `az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`. Example: `--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.
- **pipeline-id**: Required if **pipeline-name** is not supplied. ID of the pipeline.
- **pipeline-name**: Required if **pipeline-id** is not supplied, but ignored if **pipeline-id** is supplied. Name of the pipeline.
- **project**: Name or ID of the project. You can configure the default project using `az devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID`. Required if not configured as default or picked up by using `git config`.

#### Example

The following command lists all of the variables in the pipeline with ID **12** and shows the result in table format.

```azurecli
az pipelines variable list --pipeline-id 12 --output table

Name           Allow Override    Is Secret    Value
-------------  ----------------  -----------  ------------
MyVariable     False             False        platform
NextVariable   False             True         platform
Configuration  False             False        config.debug
```

::: moniker-end

## Set variables in scripts

A script in your pipeline can define a variable so that it can be consumed by one of the subsequent steps in the pipeline. All variables set by this method are treated as strings. To set a variable from a script, you use a command syntax and print to stdout.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

### Set a job-scoped variable from a script

To set a variable from a script, you use the `task.setvariable` [logging command](../scripts/logging-commands.md). This will update the environment variables for subsequent jobs. Subsequent jobs will have access to the new variable with [macro syntax](#understand-variable-syntax) and in tasks as environment variables.

When `issecret` is set to true, the value of the variable will be saved as secret and masked from the log.  For more information on secret variables, see [logging commands](../scripts/logging-commands.md).  

```yaml
steps:
# Create a variable
- bash: |
    echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=sauce]crushed tomatoes"

# Use the variable
# "$(sauce)" is replaced by the contents of the `sauce` variable by Azure Pipelines
# before handing the body of the script to the shell.
- bash: |
    echo my pipeline variable is $(sauce)
```

Subsequent steps will also have the pipeline variable added to their environment. You cannot use the variable in the step that it is defined.

```yaml
steps:
# Create a variable
# Note that this does not update the environment of the current script.
- bash: |
    echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=sauce]crushed tomatoes"

# An environment variable called `SAUCE` has been added to all downstream steps
- bash: |
    echo "my environment variable is $SAUCE"
- pwsh: |
    Write-Host "my environment variable is $env:SAUCE"
```


### Set a multi-job output variable

If you want to make a variable available to future jobs, you must mark it as
an output variable by using `isOutput=true`. Then you can map it into future jobs by using the `$[]` syntax and including the step name that set the variable. Multi-job output variables only work for jobs in the same stage. 

To pass variables to jobs in different stages, use the [stage dependencies](expressions.md#dependencies) syntax. 

> [!NOTE]
> By default, each stage in a pipeline depends on the one just before it in the YAML file. Therefore, each stage can use output variables from the prior stage. To access further stages, you will need to alter the dependency graph, for instance, if stage 3 requires a variable from stage 1, you will need to declare an explicit dependency on stage 1.

When you create a multi-job output variable, you should assign the expression to a variable. In this YAML, `$[ dependencies.A.outputs['setvarStep.myOutputVar'] ]` is assigned to the variable `$(myVarFromJobA)`. 

```yaml
jobs:
# Set an output variable from job A
- job: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'vs2017-win2016'
  steps:
  - powershell: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=myOutputVar;isOutput=true]this is the value"
    name: setvarStep
  - script: echo $(setvarStep.myOutputVar)
    name: echovar

# Map the variable into job B
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'
  variables:
    myVarFromJobA: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['setvarStep.myOutputVar'] ]  # map in the variable
                                                                          # remember, expressions require single quotes
  steps:
  - script: echo $(myVarFromJobA)
    name: echovar
```
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"

If you're setting a variable from one stage to another, use `stageDependencies`. 

```yaml
stages:
- stage: A
  jobs:
  - job: A1
    steps:
     - bash: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=myStageOutputVar;isOutput=true]this is a stage output var"
       name: printvar

- stage: B
  dependsOn: A
  variables:
    myVarfromStageA: $[ stageDependencies.A.A1.outputs['printvar.myStageOutputVar'] ]
  jobs:
  - job: B1
    steps:
    - script: echo $(myVarfromStageA)
```
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

If you're setting a variable from a [matrix](phases.md?tab=yaml#parallelexec)
or [slice](phases.md?tab=yaml#slicing), then, to reference the variable when you access it from a downstream job,
you must include:

- The name of the job.
- The step.

```yaml
jobs:

# Set an output variable from a job with a matrix
- job: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'
  strategy:
    maxParallel: 2
    matrix:
      debugJob:
        configuration: debug
        platform: x64
      releaseJob:
        configuration: release
        platform: x64
  steps:
  - bash: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=myOutputVar;isOutput=true]this is the $(configuration) value"
    name: setvarStep
  - bash: echo $(setvarStep.myOutputVar)
    name: echovar

# Map the variable from the debug job
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'
  variables:
    myVarFromJobADebug: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['debugJob.setvarStep.myOutputVar'] ]
  steps:
  - script: echo $(myVarFromJobADebug)
    name: echovar
```

```yaml
jobs:

# Set an output variable from a job with slicing
- job: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'
    parallel: 2 # Two slices
  steps:
  - bash: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=myOutputVar;isOutput=true]this is the slice $(system.jobPositionInPhase) value"
    name: setvarStep
  - script: echo $(setvarStep.myOutputVar)
    name: echovar

# Map the variable from the job for the first slice
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'
  variables:
    myVarFromJobsA1: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['job1.setvarStep.myOutputVar'] ]
  steps:
  - script: "echo $(myVarFromJobsA1)"
    name: echovar
```

Be sure to prefix the job name to the output variables of a [deployment](deployment-jobs.md) job. In this case, the job name is `A`:

```yaml
jobs:

# Set an output variable from a deployment
- deployment: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'
  environment: staging
  strategy:
    runOnce:
      deploy:
        steps:
        - bash: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=myOutputVar;isOutput=true]this is the deployment variable value"
          name: setvarStep
        - bash: echo $(setvarStep.myOutputVar)
          name: echovar

# Map the variable from the job for the first slice
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'
  variables:
    myVarFromDeploymentJob: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['A.setvarStep.myOutputVar'] ]
  steps:
  - bash: "echo $(myVarFromDeploymentJob)"
    name: echovar
```

### Set a job-scoped variable from a script

To set a variable from a script, use the `task.setvariable` logging command.
This doesn't update the environment variables, but it does make the new
variable available to downstream steps within the same job.

[!INCLUDE [include](includes/set-variables-in-scripts.md)]

### Use variables as task inputs

In order to use a variable as a task input, you must make the variable an output variable, and you must give the producing task a reference name.
You can set a task's reference name on the **Output Variables** section of the task editor.
For instance, a script task whose output variable reference name is `producer` might have the following contents:

```cmd
mkdir myDir
echo ##vso[task.setvariable variable=newworkdir;isOutput=true]$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)\myDir
```

The output variable `newworkdir` can be referenced in the input of a downstream task as `$(producer.newworkdir)`.

### Set a multi-job output variable

You can't pass a variable from one job to another job of a build pipeline, unless you use YAML.

## Set variables by using expressions

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You can set a variable by using an expression. We already encountered one case of this to set a variable to the output of another from a previous job.

```yaml
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  variables:
    myVarFromJobsA1: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['job1.setvarStep.myOutputVar'] ] # remember to use single quotes
```

You can use any of the supported expressions for setting a variable. Here's an example of setting a variable to act as a counter that starts at 100, gets incremented by 1 for every run, and gets reset to 100 every day.

```yaml
jobs:
- job:
  variables:
    a: $[counter(format('{0:yyyyMMdd}', pipeline.startTime), 100)]
  steps:
  - bash: echo $(a)
```

## Configure settable variables for steps

You can define `settableVariables` within a step or specify that no variables can be set. 

In this example, the script cannot set a variable. 

```yaml
steps:
- script: echo This is a step
  target:
    settableVariables: none
```

In this example, the script allows the variable `sauce` but not the variable `secretSauce`. You'll see a warning on the pipeline run page. 

:::image type="content" source="media/set-vars-warning.png" alt-text="Warning that you cannot set secretSauce."::: 

```yaml
steps:

      echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=secretSauce;]crushed tomatoes with garlic"

     settableVariables:
      - sauce

```

## Allow at queue time

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

If a variable appears in the `variables` block of a YAML file, its value is fixed and can't be overridden at queue time. Best practice is to define your variables in a YAML file but there are times when this doesn't make sense. For example, you may want to define a secret variable and not have the variable exposed in your YAML. Or, you may need to manually set a variable value during the pipeline run.

You have two options for defining queue-time values. You can define a variable in the UI and select the option to **Let users override this value when running this pipeline** or you can use [runtime parameters](runtime-parameters.md) instead. If your variable is not a secret, the best practice is to use [runtime parameters](runtime-parameters.md).

To set a variable at queue time, add a new variable within your pipeline and select the override option. 

:::image type="content" source="media/set-queue-time-variable.png" alt-text="Set a variable at queue time.":::

To allow a variable to be set at queue time, make sure the variable doesn't also appear in the `variables` block of a pipeline or job. If you define a variable in both the variables block of a YAML and in the UI, the value in the YAML will have priority.

## Expansion of variables

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

When you set a variable with the same name in multiple scopes, the following precedence applies (highest precedence first).

1. Job level variable set in the YAML file
1. Stage level variable set in the YAML file
1. Pipeline level variable set in the YAML file
1. Variable set at queue time
1. Pipeline variable set in Pipeline settings UI

In the following example, the same variable `a` is set at the pipeline level and job level in YAML file. It's also set in a variable group `G`, and as a variable in the Pipeline settings UI.

```yaml
variables:
  a: 'pipeline yaml'

stages:
- stage: one
  displayName: one
  variables:
  - name: a
    value: 'stage yaml'

  jobs:
  - job: A
    variables:
    - name: a
      value: 'job yaml'
    steps:
    - bash: echo $(a)        # This will be 'job yaml'
```
When you set a variable with the same name in the same scope, the last set value will take precedence.

```yaml
stages:
- stage: one
  displayName: Stage One
  variables: 
    - name: a
      value: alpha
    - name: a
      value: beta
  jobs: 
  - job: I
    displayName: Job I
    variables:
      - name: b
        value: uno
      - name: b
        value: dos
    steps: 
    - script: echo $(a) #outputs beta
    - script: echo $(b) #outputs dos
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you set a variable in the YAML file, don't define it in the web editor as settable at queue time. You can't currently change variables that are set in the YAML file at queue time. If you need a variable to be settable at queue time, don't set it in the YAML file.

Variables are expanded once when the run is started, and again at the beginning of each step. For example:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  variables:
    a: 10
  steps:
  - bash: |
      echo $(a)            # This will be 10
      echo '##vso[task.setvariable variable=a]20'
      echo $(a)            # This will also be 10, since the expansion of $(a) happens before the step
  - bash: echo $(a)        # This will be 20, since the variables are expanded just before the step
```

There are two steps in the preceding example. The expansion of `$(a)` happens once at the beginning of the job, and once at the beginning of each of the two steps.

Because variables are expanded at the beginning of a job, you can't use them in a strategy. In the following example, you can't use the variable `a` to expand the job matrix, because the variable is only available at the beginning of each expanded job.

```yaml
jobs:
- job: A
  variables:
    a: 10
  strategy:
    matrix:
      x:
        some_variable: $(a)    # This does not work
```

If the variable `a` is an output variable from a previous job, then you can use it in a future job.

```yaml
- job: A
  steps:
  - powershell: echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=a;isOutput=true]10"
    name: a_step

# Map the variable into job B
- job: B
  dependsOn: A
  variables:
    some_variable: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['a_step.a'] ]
```

### Recursive expansion

On the agent, variables referenced using `$( )` syntax are recursively expanded.
For example:

```yaml
variables:
  myInner: someValue
  myOuter: $(myInner)

steps:
- script: echo $(myOuter)  # prints "someValue"
  displayName: Variable is $(myOuter)  # display name is "Variable is someValue"
```

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
When you set a variable with the same name in multiple scopes, the following precedence applies (highest precedence first).

1. Variable set at queue time
1. Variable set in the pipeline
1. Variable set in the variable group

Variables are expanded once when the run is started, and again at the beginning of each step. Here's an example to demonstrate this:

- You set a variable called `a` to 10 in a pipeline.
- In one of the steps (a bash script step), run the following script:

   ```bash
   echo $(a)            # This will be 10
   echo '##vso[task.setvariable variable=a]20'
   echo $(a)            # This will also be 10, since the expansion of $(a) happens before the step
   ```

- In the next step (another bash script step), run the following script:

   ```bash
   echo $(a)            # This will be 20, since the variables are expanded just before the step
   ```
