# Access repositories, artifacts, and other resources

At run-time, each job in a pipeline may access other resources in Azure DevOps. For example, a job may:
- Check out source code from a Git repository
- Add a tag to the repository
- Access a feed in Azure Artifacts
- Upload logs from the agent to the service
- Upload test results and other artifacts from the agent to the service
- Update a work item

Azure Pipelines uses job access tokens to perform these tasks. A **job access token** is a security token that is dynamically generated by Azure Pipelines for each job at run time. The agent on which the job is running uses the job access token in order to access these resources in Azure DevOps. You can control which resources your pipeline has access to by controlling how permissions are granted to job access tokens.

The token's permissions are derived from (a) job authorization scope and (b) the permissions you set on project or collection build service account.

## Job authorization scope

You can set the job authorization scope to be **collection** or **project**. By setting the scope to **collection**, you choose to let pipelines access all repositories in the collection or organization. By setting the scope to **project**, you choose to restrict access to only those repositories that are in the same project as the pipeline.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml/)

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"

Job authorization scope can be set for the entire Azure DevOps organization or for a specific project. 

To set job authorization scope for the organization:

- Navigate to your organization settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

To set job authorization scope for a specific project:

- Navigate to your project settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope is set to **project** at the organization level, you cannot change the scope in each project.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If the scope is not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then every job in your YAML pipeline gets a collection scoped job access token. In other words, your pipeline has access to any repository in any project of your organization. If an adversary is able to gain access to a single pipeline in a single project, he or she will be able to gain access to any repository in your organization. This is why, it is recommended that you restrict the scope at the highest level (organization settings) in order to contain the attack to a single project.

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

If you use Azure DevOps Server 2019, then all YAML jobs run with the job authorization scope set to **collection**. In other words, these jobs have access to all repositories in your project collection. You cannot change this in Azure DevOps server 2019.

YAML pipelines are not available in TFS.

# [Classic](#tab/classic/)

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"

Job authorization scope can be set for the entire Azure DevOps organization, for a specific project, or for a specific pipeline. 

To set job authorization scope for the organization:

- Navigate to your organization settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

To set job authorization scope for a specific project:

- Navigate to your project settings page in the Azure DevOps user interface.
- Select **Settings** under **Pipelines**.
- Turn on the toggle **Limit job authorization scope to current project** to limit the scope to project. This is the recommended setting, as it enhances security for your pipelines.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope is set to **project** at the organization level, you cannot change the scope in each project.

To set job authorization scope for a specific pipeline:

- Navigate to the pipeline in the **Pipelines** page.
- Select **Edit** to edit the pipeline.
- In the **Options** tab, select **Project collection** or **Current project** for **Build job authorization scope**.
- Save the build pipeline.

>[!NOTE]
>If the scope if restricted to **project** in the organization or project level settings, then the pipeline-level job authorization scope is ignored. The project or organization level setting prevails.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the scopes are not restricted at either the organization level or project level, then you are allowing the pipeline authors to determine the access they need to repositories. If an adversary is able to create or edit a pipeline in one project, he or she will be able to gain access to any repository in your organization. This is why, it is recommended that you restrict the scope at the highest level (organization settings) in order to contain the attack to a single project.

Job authorization scope can be set for each pipeline. To set this scope:

- Navigate to the pipeline in the **Pipelines** page.
- Select **Edit** to edit the pipeline.
- In the **Options** tab, select **Project collection** or **Current project** for **Build job authorization scope**.
- Save the build pipeline.

>[!NOTE]
> If your pipeline is in a **public project**, then the job authorization scope is automatically restricted to **project** no matter what you configure in any setting. Jobs in a public project can access resources such as build artifacts or test results only within the project and not from other projects of the organization.

## Build service account

You may want to change the permissions of job access token in scenarios such as the following:

- You want your pipeline to access a feed that is in a different project.
- You want your pipeline to be restricted from changing code in the repository.
- You want your pipeline to be restricted from creating work items.

To update the permissions of job access token:

- First, determine the job authorization scope for your pipeline. See the section above to understand job authorization scope. If the job authorization scope is **collection**, then the corresponding build service account to manage permissions on is **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**. If the job authorization scope is **project**, then the build service account to manage permissions on is **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)**.

- To restrict or grant additional access to **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**:
  - Select **Manage security** in the overflow menu on **Pipelines** page.
  - Under **Users**, select **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Navigate to organization settings for your Azure DevOps organization (or collection settings for your project collection).
  - Select **Permissions** under **Security**.
  - Under the **Users** tab, look for **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the non-pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Since **Project Collection Build Service (your-collection-name)** is a user in your organization or collection, you can add this account explicitly to any resource - for e.g., to a feed in Azure Artifacts.

- To restrict or grant additional access to **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)**:
  - The build service account on which you can manage permissions will only be created after you run the pipeline once. Make sure that you already ran the pipeline once.
  - Select **Manage security** in the overflow menu on **Pipelines** page.
  - Under **Users**, select **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Navigate to organization settings for your Azure DevOps organization (or collection settings for your project collection).
  - Select **Permissions** under **Security**.
  - Under the **Users** tab, look for **Your-project-name build service (your-collection-name)**.
  - Make any changes to the non-pipelines-related permissions for this account.
  - Since **Your-project-name Build Service (your-collection-name)** is a user in your organization or collection, you can add this account explicitly to any resource - for e.g., to a feed in Azure Artifacts.

## FAQ

### How do I determine the job authorization scope of my YAML pipeline?

* If the pipeline is in a public project, then the job authorization scope is **project**.
* If the pipeline is in a private project, check the Pipeline settings under your Azure DevOps **organization settings**:
  * If the toggle for "Limit job authorization scope to current project" is enabled, then the scope is **project**.
  * If the toggle is not enabled, then check the Pipeline settings under your **project settings** in Azure DevOps:
    * If the toggle for "Limit job authorization scope to current project" is enabled, then the scope is **project**.
    * Or else, the scope is **collection**.
