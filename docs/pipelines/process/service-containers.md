# Service Containers

**Azure Pipelines**

If your pipeline requires the support of one or more services, in many cases you'll want to create, connect to, and clean up each
service on a per-job basis. For instance, a pipeline may run integration tests that require access to
a database and a memory cache. The database and memory cache need to be freshly created for each job in the pipeline.

A container provides a simple and portable way to run a service that your pipeline depends on.
A _service container_ enables you to automatically create, network, and manage the lifecycle of your containerized service.
Each service container is accessible by only the job that requires it.
Service containers work with any kind of [job](phases.md), but they're most commonly used with [container jobs](container-phases.md).

## Requirements

Service containers must define a `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`.
The pipeline will `docker run` the provided container without additional arguments.

Azure Pipelines can run Linux or [Windows Containers](/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/). Use either
the Hosted Ubuntu 1604 pool for Linux containers, or the Hosted Windows Container pool for Windows containers.
(The Hosted macOS pool does not support running containers.)
If you want to use a self-hosted agent, it must be running [Windows Server version 1803](/windows-server/get-started/get-started-with-1803) or newer.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

## Single container job

A simple example of using [container jobs](container-phases.md):

```yaml
resources:
  containers:
  - container: my_container
    image: ubuntu:16.04
  - container: nginx
    image: nginx
  - container: redis
    image: redis

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'

container: my_container

services:
  nginx: nginx
  redis: redis

steps:
- script: |
    apt install -y curl
    curl nginx
    apt install redis-tools
    redis-cli -h redis ping
```

This pipeline fetches the latest `nginx` and `redis` containers from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)
and then starts the containers. The containers are networked together so that they can reach each other
by their `services` name. The pipeline then runs the `apt`, `curl` and `redis-cli` commands inside the `ubuntu:16.04` container.
From inside this job container, the `nginx` and `redis` host names resolve to the correct services using Docker networking.
All containers on the network automatically expose all ports to each other.

## Single job

You can also use service containers without a job container. A simple example:

```yaml
resources:
  containers:
  - container: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - 8080:80
    env:
      NGINX_PORT: 80
  - container: redis
    image: redis
    ports:
    - 6379

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'

services:
  nginx: nginx
  redis: redis

steps:
- script: |
    curl localhost:8080
    redis-cli -p "${AGENT_SERVICES_REDIS_PORTS_6379}" ping
```

This pipeline starts the latest `nginx` and `redis` containers,
and then publishes the specified ports to the host. Since the job is not running in a container, there's no automatic name resolution.
This example shows how you can instead reach services by using `localhost`. 
In the above example we provide the port explicitly (for example, `8080:80`).

An alternative approach is to let a random
port get assigned dynamically at runtime. You can then access these dynamic ports by using [variables](variables.md). 
In a Bash script, you can access a variable by using the process environment. These variables take the form: `agent.services.<serviceName>.ports.<port>`.
In the above example, `redis` is assigned a random available port on the host.
The `agent.services.redis.ports.6379` variable contains the port number.

## Multiple jobs

Service containers are also useful for running the same steps against multiple versions of the same service.
In the following example, the same steps run against multiple versions of PostgreSQL.

```yaml
resources:
  containers:
  - container: my_container
    image: ubuntu:16.04
  - container: pg11
    image: postgres:11
  - container: pg10
    image: postgres:10

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04'

strategy:
  matrix:
    postgres11:
      postgresService: pg11
    postgres10:
      postgresService: pg10

container: my_container

services:
  postgres: $[ variables['postgresService'] ]
steps:
  - script: |
      apt install -y postgresql-client
      psql --host=postgres --username=postgres --command="SELECT 1;"
```

## Ports

When specifying a container resource or an inline container, you can specify an array of `ports` to expose on the container.

```yaml
resources:
  container:
  - container: my_service
    image: my_service:latest
    ports:
    - 8080:80
    - 5432

services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
    - 6379/tcp
```

Specifying `ports` is not required if your job is running in a container because containers on the same Docker network automatically expose all ports
to each other by default.

If your job is running on the host, then `ports` are required to access the service. A port takes the form `<hostPort>:<containerPort>` or just `<containerPort>`,
with an optional `/<protocol>` at the end, for example `6379/tcp` to expose `tcp` over port `6379`, bound to a random port on the host machine.

For ports bound to a random port on the host machine, the pipeline creates a variable of the form `agent.services.<serviceName>.ports.<port>` so that it can be accessed
by the job. For example, `agent.services.redis.ports.6379` resolves to the randomly assigned port on the host machine.

## Volumes

Volumes are useful for sharing data between services, or for persisting data between multiple runs of a job.

You can specify volume mounts as an array of `volumes`. Volumes can either be named Docker volumes, anonymous Docker volumes, or bind mounts on the host.

```yaml
services:
  my_service:
    image: myservice:latest
    volumes:
    - mydockervolume:/data/dir
    - /data/dir
    - /src/dir:/dst/dir
```

Volumes take the form `<source>:<destinationPath>`, where `<source>` can be a named volume or an absolute path on the host machine, and `<destinationPath>` is
an absolute path in the container.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use our hosted pools, then your volumes will not be persisted between jobs because the host machine is cleaned up after the job is completed.

## Other options

Service containers share the same container resources as container jobs. This means that you can use the same
[additional options](container-phases.md?tabs=yaml#other-settings).

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

Service containers are not yet supported in classic pipelines.

## Healthcheck

Optionally, if any service container specifies a [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck), the
agent waits until the container is healthy before running the job.
