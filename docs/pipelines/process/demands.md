# Specify demands

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/concept-rename-note.md)]
::: moniker-end

Use demands to make sure that the [capabilities](../agents/agents.md#capabilities) your pipeline needs are present on the agents that run it. Demands are asserted automatically by tasks or manually by you.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Demands and capabilities are designed for use with self-hosted agents so that jobs can be matched with an agent that 
> meets the requirements of the job. When using Microsoft-hosted agents, you select an image for the agent that 
> matches the requirements of the job, so although it is possible to add capabilities to a Microsoft-hosted agent, you don't need 
> to use capabilities with Microsoft-hosted agents.

## Task demands

Some tasks won't run unless one or more demands are met by the agent. For example, the [Visual Studio Build](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/vsbuild-v1) task demands that ```msbuild``` and ```visualstudio``` are installed on the agent.

## Manually entered agent demands

You might need to use self-hosted agents with special capabilities. For example, your pipeline may require **SpecialSoftware** on agents in the `Default` pool. Or, if you have multiple agents with different operating systems in the same pool, you may have a pipeline that requires a Linux agent.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

:::moniker range=">=azure-devops-2019"

To add a single demand to your YAML build pipeline, add the `demands:` line to the `pool` section.
```yaml
pool:
  name: Default
  demands: SpecialSoftware # exists check for SpecialSoftware
```

Or if you need to add multiple demands, add one per line.

```yaml
pool:
  name: MyPool
  demands:
  - myCustomCapability   # exists check for myCustomCapability
  - Agent.Version -equals 2.144.0 # equals check for Agent.Version 2.144.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> Checking for the existence of a capability (exists) and checking for a specific string in a capability (equals) are the only two supported operations for demands.

For more information and examples, see [YAML schema - Demands](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/pool).

:::moniker-end

:::moniker range="<azure-devops-2019"

YAML Pipelines are supported in Azure DevOps Server 2019 and higher.

:::moniker-end

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

In the Tasks tab of the pipeline, add the demand to your agent job.

| Name | Condition | Value |
|---|---|---|
| SpecialSoftware | exists | N/A |
| Agent.OS | equals | Linux |

---

Register each agent that has the capability.

1. In your web browser, navigate to Agent pools:

   [!INCLUDE [agent-pools-tab](../agents/includes/agent-pools-tab.md)]

1. Navigate to the capabilities tab for the agent:
 
   [!INCLUDE [agent-capabilities](../agents/includes/agent-capabilities-tab.md)]

1. Add something like the following entry:

| First box | Second box |
|---|---|
| SpecialSoftware | C:\Program Files (x86)\SpecialSoftware |

> [!TIP]
> For classic non-YAML build definitions, when you manually queue a build you can change the demands on that run.
