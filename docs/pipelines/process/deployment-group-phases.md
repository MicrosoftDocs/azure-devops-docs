# Deployment group jobs

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018**

[Deployment groups](../release/deployment-groups/index.md) make it easy to define groups of target servers for deployment. Tasks that you define in a deployment group job run on some or all of the target servers, depending on the arguments you specify for the tasks and the job itself.

You can select specific sets of servers from a deployment group to receive the deployment by specifying the machine tags that you have defined for each server in the deployment group. You can also specify the proportion of the target servers that the pipeline should deploy to at the same time. This ensures that the app running on these servers is capable of handling requests while the deployment is taking place.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

> [!NOTE]

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

You add a deployment group job in the editor by selecting '...' on **Process** channel in the **Tasks** tab of a release pipeline. The properties for the deployment group job are displayed when you select the job in the editor.

> [!NOTE]
> Deployment group jobs can only be used in release pipelines. They cannot be used in build pipelines.

## Timeouts

Use the job timeout to specify the timeout in minutes for jobs in this job. A zero
  value for this option means that the timeout is effectively infinite and so, by default, jobs run until they complete or fail.
  You can also set the timeout for each task individually - see [task control options](tasks.md#controloptions). Jobs targeting Microsoft-hosted agents have [additional restrictions](../agents/hosted.md) on how long they may run.
