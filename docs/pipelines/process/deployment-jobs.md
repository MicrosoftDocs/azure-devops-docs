# Deployment jobs

[!INCLUDE [version-team-services](../_shared/version-team-services.md)]

> [!NOTE]

> To use deployment jobs, [make sure the Multi-stage pipelines experience is turned on](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

In YAML pipelines, we recommend that you put your deployment steps in a deployment job. A deployment job is a special type of [job](phases.md) that is a collection of steps to be run sequentially against the environment.

## Overview

Using deployment job provides some benefits:

 - **Deployment history**: You get end-to-end deployment history across pipelines down to a specific resource and status of the deployments for auditing.
 - **Apply deployment strategy**: Define how your application is rolled-out.

   > [!NOTE] 
   > At the moment we offer only the *runOnce* strategy, which executes the steps once sequentially. Additional strategies like blue-green, canary and rolling are on our roadmap.

## Schema

Here's the full syntax to specify a deployment job: 

```YAML
jobs:
- deployment: string   # name of the deployment job, A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and underscore
  displayName: string  # friendly name to display in the UI
  pool:                # see pool schema
    name: string
    demands: string | [ string ]
  dependsOn: string 
  condition: string 
  continueOnError: boolean                # 'true' if future jobs should run even if this job fails; defaults to 'false'
  timeoutInMinutes: nonEmptyString        # how long to run the job before automatically cancelling
  cancelTimeoutInMinutes: nonEmptyString  # how much time to give 'run always even if cancelled tasks' before killing them
  variables: { string: string } | [ variable | variableReference ]  
  environment: string  # target environment name and optionally a resource-name to record the deployment history; format: <environment-name>.<resource-name>
  strategy:
    runOnce:
      deploy:
        displayName: string                 # friendly name to display in the UI
        steps:
        - script: [ script | bash | pwsh | powershell | checkout | task | templateReference ]
```

## Examples

The following example YAML snippet showcases a simple use of a deploy job - 

```YAML
jobs:
  # track deployments on the environment
- deployment: DeployWeb
  displayName: deploy Web App
  pool:
    vmImage: 'Ubuntu-16.04'
  # creates an environment if it doesn't exist
  environment: 'smarthotel-dev'
  strategy:
    # default deployment strategy, more coming...
    runOnce:
      deploy:
        steps:
        - script: echo my first deployment
```

In the above example, with each run of this job, deployment history is recorded against the "smarthotel-dev" environment.

> [!NOTE]
> - Currently only Kubernetes resources are supported within an environment, with support for VMs and other resources on the roadmap.
> - It is also possible to create an environment with empty resources and use that as an abstract shell to record deployment history as shown in the previous example.

The following example snippet demonstrates how a pipeline can refer an environment and a resource within the same to be used as the target for a deployment job.

```YAML
jobs:
- deployment: DeployWeb
  displayName: deploy Web App
  pool:
    vmImage: 'Ubuntu-16.04'
  # records deployment against bookings resource - Kubernetes namespace
  environment: 'smarthotel-dev.bookings'
  strategy: 
    runOnce:
      deploy:
        steps:
          # No need to explicitly pass the connection details
        - task: KubernetesManifest@0
          displayName: Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
          inputs:
            action: deploy
            namespace: $(k8sNamespace)
            manifests: |
              $(System.ArtifactsDirectory)/manifests/*
            imagePullSecrets: |
              $(imagePullSecret)
            containers: |
              $(containerRegistry)/$(imageRepository):$(tag)
```

This approach has the following benefits:
- Records deployment history on a specific resource within the environment as opposed to recording the history on all resources within the environment.
- Steps in the deployment job **automatically inherit** the connection details of the resource (in this case, a kubernetes namespace: `smarthotel-dev.bookings`), since the deployment job is linked to the environment. 
This is particularly useful in the cases where the same connection detail is to be set for multiple steps of the job.
