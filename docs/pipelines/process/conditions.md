# Conditions

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.3** 

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/concept-rename-note.md)]
::: moniker-end

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml/)
::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can specify conditions under which a step, job, or stage will run.
[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/task-run-built-in-conditions.md)]
* Custom conditions

By default, steps, jobs, and stages run if all previous steps/jobs have succeeded.
It's as if you specified "condition: succeeded()" (see [Job status functions](expressions.md#job-status-functions)).

```yaml
jobs:
- job: Foo

  steps:
  - script: echo Hello!
    condition: always() # this step will always run, even if the pipeline is cancelled

- job: Bar
  dependsOn: Foo
  condition: failed() # this job will only run if Foo fails
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
YAML is not yet supported in TFS.
::: moniker-end

#### [Classic](#tab/classic/)
Inside the **Control Options** of each task, and in the **Additional options** for a job in a release pipeline,
you can specify the conditions under which the task or job will run:

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/task-run-built-in-conditions.md)]
* Custom conditions

* * *
## Enable a custom condition

If the built-in conditions don't meet your needs, then you can specify **custom conditions**.

::: moniker range="= tfs-2017"

> In TFS 2017.3, custom task conditions are available in the user interface only for Build pipelines. You can use the Release [REST APIs](../../integrate/index.md) to establish custom conditions for Release pipelines.

::: moniker-end

Conditions are written as expressions.
The agent evaluates the expression beginning with the innermost function and works its way out.
The final result is a boolean value that determines if the task, job, or stage should run or not.
See the [expressions](expressions.md) topic for a full guide to the syntax.

Do any of your conditions make it possible for the task to run even after the build is canceled by a user? If so, then specify a reasonable value for [cancel timeout](phases.md#timeouts) so that these kinds of tasks have enough time to complete after the user cancels a run.

## Examples

### Run for the master branch, if succeeding

```
and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/master'))
```

### Run if the branch is not master, if succeeding

```
and(succeeded(), ne(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/master'))
```

### Run for user topic branches, if succeeding

```
and(succeeded(), startsWith(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/users/'))
```

### Run for continuous integration (CI) builds if succeeding

```
and(succeeded(), in(variables['Build.Reason'], 'IndividualCI', 'BatchedCI'))
```

### Run if the build is run by a branch policy for a pull request, if failing

```
and(failed(), eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'PullRequest'))
```

### Run if the build is scheduled, even if failing, even if canceled

```
and(always(), eq(variables['Build.Reason'], 'Schedule'))
```

> **Release.Artifacts.{artifact-alias}.SourceBranch** is equivalent to **Build.SourceBranch**.

### Use a template parameter as part of a condition

Parameter expansion happens before conditions are considered, so you can embed parameters inside conditions.

```yaml
parameters:
  doThing: false

steps:
- script: echo I did a thing
  condition: and(succeeded(), eq('${{ parameters.doThing }}', 'true'))
```

## Q&A

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### I've got a conditional step that runs even when a job is cancelled. Does this affect a job that I cancelled in the queue?

No. If you cancel a job while it's in the queue, then the entire job is canceled, including steps like this.

### I've got a conditional step that should run even when the deployment is canceled. How do I specify this?

If you defined the pipelines using a YAML file, then this is supported. This scenario is not yet supported for release pipelines.
