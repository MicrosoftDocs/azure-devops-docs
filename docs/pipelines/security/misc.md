# Other security considerations

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

There are a handful of other things you should consider when securing pipelines.

## Relying on PATH

Relying on the agent's `PATH` setting is dangerous.
It may not point where you think it does, since a previous script or tool could have altered it.
For security-critical scripts and binaries, always use a fully qualified path to the program.

## Logging of secrets

Azure Pipelines attempts to scrub secrets from logs wherever possible.
This filtering is on a best-effort basis and can't catch every way that secrets can be leaked.
Avoid echoing secrets to the console, using them in command line parameters, or logging them to files.

## Lock down containers

Containers have a few system-provided volume mounts mapping in the tasks, the workspace, and external components required to communicate with the host agent.
You can mark any or all of these volumes read-only.

```yaml
resources:
  containers:
  - container: example
    image: ubuntu:22.04
    mountReadOnly:
      externals: true
      tasks: true
      tools: true
      work: false  # the default; shown here for completeness
```

Most people should mark the first three read-only and leave `work` as read-write.
If you know you won't write to the work directory in a given job or step, go ahead and make `work` read-only as well.
If you have tasks in your pipeline, which self-modify, you may need to leave `tasks` read-write.

## Control available tasks

You can disable the ability to install and run tasks from the Marketplace.
This will allow you greater control over the code that executes in a pipeline.
You may also disable all the in-the-box tasks (except Checkout, which is a special action on the agent).
We recommend that you don't disable in-the-box tasks under most circumstances.

Tasks directly installed with [`tfx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tfx-cli) are always available.
With both of these features enabled, **only** those tasks are available.

## Use the Auditing service

Many pipeline events are recorded in the Auditing service.
Review the audit log periodically to ensure no malicious changes have slipped past.
Visit `https://dev.azure.com/ORG-NAME/_settings/audit` to get started.
