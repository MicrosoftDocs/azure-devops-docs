# Create a multi-platform pipeline

**Azure Pipelines**

This is a step-by-step guide to using Azure Pipelines to build on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/ci-cd-prerequisites-vsts.md)]

* You need a GitHub account, where you can create a repository.

## Get the sample code

You can use Azure Pipelines to build an app on written in any language, on multiple platforms at the same time.

1. Go to https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-javascript.

1. Fork the repo into your own GitHub account.

You should now have a sample app in your GitHub account.

## Add additional platforms

In the sample repo, the Node.js app is configured to run on Ubuntu Linux. You're going to add a second job that runs on Windows.

1. Go to your fork of the sample code on GitHub.

1. Select `azure-pipelines.yml`, and then select the _Edit this file_ pencil icon.

1. In GitHub's web editor, replace the existing content with the content below.

```yaml
# Build NodeJS Express app using Azure Pipelines
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/javascript?view=vsts
jobs:
- job: Linux

  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu 16.04'

  steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '8.x'

  - script: |
      npm install
      npm test

  - task: PublishTestResults@2
    inputs:
      testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-RESULTS.xml'
      testRunTitle: 'Test results for JavaScript'

  - task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@1
    inputs: 
      codeCoverageTool: Cobertura
      summaryFileLocation: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*coverage.xml'
      reportDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/coverage'

  - task: ArchiveFiles@2
    inputs:
      rootFolderOrFile: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
      includeRootFolder: false

  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1

- job: Windows

  pool:
    vmImage: 'vs2017-win2016'

  steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: '8.x'

  - script: |
      npm install
      npm test

  - task: PublishTestResults@2
    inputs:
      testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-RESULTS.xml'
      testRunTitle: 'Test results for JavaScript'

  - task: PublishCodeCoverageResults@1
    inputs: 
      codeCoverageTool: Cobertura
      summaryFileLocation: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*coverage.xml'
      reportDirectory: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/coverage'

  - task: ArchiveFiles@2
    inputs:
      rootFolderOrFile: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)'
      includeRootFolder: false

  - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
```

At the bottom of the GitHub editor, select **Commit changes**.

Each job in this example runs on a different VM image.
By default, the Linux and Windows jobs run at the same time in parallel.

Note: To make this example clearer, we've copied the code.
However, when you go to put a pipeline for your app into production, we recommend that you instead use [templates](process/templates.md) to reduce code duplication.
Also, `script` runs in each platform's native script interpreter: Bash on macOS and Linux, CMD on Windows.
See [multi-platform scripts](scripts/cross-platform-scripting.md) to learn more.

## Create the pipeline

Now that you've configured your GitHub repo with a pipeline, you're ready to build it.

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization and navigate to your project.

1. In your project, go to the **Pipelines** page, and then select **New pipeline**.

1. Select **GitHub** as the location of your source code.

   ![Select GitHub](_img/get-started-yaml/new-pipeline.png)

1. For **Repository**, select **Authorize** and then **Authorize with OAuth**. 

1. You might be redirected to GitHub to sign in. If this happens, then enter your GitHub credentials. After you're redirected back to Azure Pipelines, select the **sample app** repository.

1. For the **Template**, Azure Pipelines analyzes the code in your repository. If your repository already contains an `azure-pipelines.yml` file (as in this case), then this step is skipped. Otherwise, Azure Pipelines recommends a starter template based on the code in your repository.

1. Azure Pipelines shows you the YAML file that it will use to create your pipeline.

1. Select **Save and run**, and then select the option to **Commit directly to the master branch**.

1. The YAML file is pushed to your GitHub repository, and a new build is automatically started. Wait for the build to finish.

## Next steps

You've just learned the basics of using multiple platforms with Azure Pipelines. From here, you can learn more about:

* Running [multiple jobs](process/multiple-phases.md?tabs=yaml)
* [Cross-platform scripting](scripts/cross-platform-scripting.md)
* [Templates](process/templates.md) to remove the duplication
* Building [Node.js](languages/javascript.md) apps
* Building [.NET Core](languages/dotnet-core.md), [Go](languages/go.md), [Java](languages/java.md), or [Python](languages/python.md) apps
