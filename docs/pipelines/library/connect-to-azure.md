# Connect to Azure with an Azure Resource Manager service connection

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

> [!NOTE]
>We are rolling out the new Azure service connection creation experience. Receiving it in your organization depends on various factors, and you may still see the older user experience.

An Azure Resource Manager service connection allows you to connect to Azure resources like Azure Key Vault from your pipeline. This connection lets you use a pipeline to deploy to Azure resources, such as an Azure App Service app, without needing to authenticate each time.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
You have multiple authentication options for connecting to Azure with an Azure Resource Manager service connection. We recommend using [workload identity federation](/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identity-federation) with either an app registration or managed identity. Workload identity federation eliminates the need for secrets and secret management. 

Recommended options:
* [App registration (automatic) with workload identity federation](#create-an-app-registration-with-workload-identity-federation-automatic) 
* Managed identity that creates a workload identity federation credential and connects to an [existing user-assigned managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity). Use this option when you [don't have permission to create an app registration](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-app-roles#to-disable-the-default-ability-to-create-application-registrations-or-consent-to-applications).
* [App registration or managed identity (manual) with workload identity federation or a secret](../release/configure-workload-identity.md). Manual configuration is more time consuming than the automatic configuration and should only be used if you've already tried to automatic option. 

> [!NOTE]
> There are other Azure Resource Manager service connection authentication options that don't use workload identity federation. These options are available for backwards compatibility and edge cases and not recommended. If you're setting up a service connection for the first time, use workload identity federation. If you have an existing service connection, try [converting your service connection to use workload identity federation](#convert-an-existing-service-connection-to-use-workload-identity-federation) first. 
> * [Automatic app registration with a secret](azure-resource-manager-alternate-approaches.md#create-an-app-registration-with-a-secret-automatic)
> * [Agent-assigned managed identity](azure-resource-manager-alternate-approaches.md#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-to-a-vm-that-uses-a-managed-identity)

## Create an app registration with workload identity federation (automatic)

<a name="create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-that-uses-workload-identity-federation"></a>
You can use this approach if all the following items are true for your scenario:

* You have the Owner role for your Azure subscription.
* You're not connecting to the [Azure Stack](azure-resource-manager-alternate-approaches.md#connect-to-azure-stack) or the [Azure US Government](azure-resource-manager-alternate-approaches.md#connect-to-an-azure-government-cloud) environments.
* Any Marketplace extensions tasks that you use are updated to support workload identity federation.

With this selection, Azure DevOps automatically queries for the subscription, management group, or Machine Learning workspace that you want to connect to and creates a workload identity federation for authentication.

1. In the Azure DevOps project, go to **Project settings** > **Service connections**.

   For more information, see [Open project settings](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).

1. Select **New service connection**,  then select **Azure Resource Manager** and **Next**.

1. Select **App registration (automatic)** with the credential **Workload identity federation**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/select-app-registration-workload-identity-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of app registration (automatic) authentication method selection with workload identity selected.":::

1. Select a **Scope level**. Select **Subscription**, **Management Group**, or **Machine Learning Workspace**. [Management groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management-groups-overview) are containers that help you manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions. A [Machine Learning Workspace](/azure/machine-learning/concept-workspace) is place to create machine learning artifacts.

    * For the **Subscription** scope, enter the following parameters:
    
        | Parameter | Description |
        | --------- | ----------- |
        | **Subscription** | Required. Select the Azure subscription. |
        | **Resource group** | Optional. Select the Azure resource group. |
    
    * For the **Management Group** scope, select the **Azure management group**.
    
    * For the **Machine Learning Workspace** scope, enter the following parameters:

## Convert an existing service connection to use workload identity federation

You can quickly convert an existing Azure Resource Manager service connection to use workload identity federation for authentication instead of a secret. You can use the service connection conversion tool in Azure DevOps if your service connection meets these requirements:

* Azure DevOps originally created the service connection. If you manually create your service connection, you can't convert the service connection by using the service connection conversion tool because Azure DevOps doesn't have permissions to modify its own credentials.
* Only one project uses the service connection. You can't convert [cross-project service connections](../policies/permissions.md#set-service-connection-project-permissions).

To convert a service connection:

1. In the Azure DevOps project, go to **Project settings** > **Service connections**.

   For more information, see [Open project settings](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).

1. Select the service connection that you want to convert to use workload identity.

1. Select **Convert**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/federated-convert-credential.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting convert for federated credentials.":::
    
    If you have an existing credential with an expired secret, you see a different option to convert. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/secret-expired-workload-convert.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows option to convert to use federated credentials when you have an expired certificate. ":::

1. Select **Convert** again to confirm that you want to create a new service connection.

   The conversion might take a few minutes. If you want to revert the connection, you must revert it within seven days.

#### Convert multiple service connections with a script

Use a script to update multiple service connections at once to now use workload identity federation for authentication.

This example PowerShell script requires two parameters: Azure DevOps organization (example: `https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam-tailspin`) and Azure DevOps project (example: `Space game web agent`). The script then retrieves the associated service connections for your Azure DevOps project and organization. 

When converting service connections to use workload identity federation, you're prompted to confirm the update for each connection not already using it. Upon confirmation, the script updates these service connections via the Azure DevOps REST API to utilize workload identity federation.

The script requires [PowerShell 7.3 or newer](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) and [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to run. Save the script to a `.ps1` file and run it using PowerShell 7.

```powershell

### Revert an existing service connection that uses a secret

You can revert a converted automatic service connection with its secret for seven days. After seven days, manually create a new secret.

If you manually create and convert your service connection, you can't revert the service connection by using the service connection conversion tool because Azure DevOps doesn't have permissions to modify its own credentials.

To revert a service connection:

1. In the Azure DevOps project, go to **Pipelines** > **Service connections**.

1. Select an existing service connection to revert.

1. Select **Revert conversion to the original scheme**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/federated-revert-credential.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting revert for a federated credential.":::

1. Select **Revert** again to confirm your choice.
