# Manage service connections

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This article covers service connections in Azure Pipelines. Service connections are authenticated connections between Azure Pipelines and external or remote services that you use to execute tasks in a job.

For example, your pipelines might use the following categories of service connections:

- Azure subscriptions, to use for Azure Web Site Deployment tasks.
- Different build servers or file servers, such as a standard GitHub Enterprise Server service connection to a GitHub repository.
- Online continuous integration environments, such as a Jenkins service connection for continuous integration of Git repositories.
- Services installed on remote computers, such as an Azure Resource Manager service connection to an Azure virtual machine with a managed service identity.
- External services, such as a service connection to a Docker registry, Kubernetes cluster, or Maven repository.
  
The first part of this article explains how to create, view, edit, and use service connections. The second part of the article provides a reference to [Azure Pipelines service connection types](#common-service-connection-types).

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps project and pipeline.
- The appropriate assigned user roles to create, view, use, or manage a service connection. For more information, see [Service connection permissions](../policies/service-connection-permissions.md).

## Create a service connection

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

To create a service connection for Azure Pipelines:

1. In your Azure DevOps project, select **Project settings** > **Service connections**.

1. Select **New service connection**, select the type of service connection that you need, and then select **Next**.

1. Choose an authentication method, and then select **Next**.

1. Enter the parameters for the service connection. The parameters vary based on the [service connection type](#common-service-connection-types) and authentication method.

   Depending on the service connection type and authentication method, there might be a link to **Verify** the connection. The validation link uses a REST call to the external service with the information that you entered, and indicates whether the call succeeded.
   
1. Enter a **Service connection name** to use for the service connection in task properties.

1. Optionally, enter a **Description**.

1. Select **Grant access permission to all pipelines** to allow all pipelines to use this connection.

   If you don't select this option, you must later explicitly [authorize each pipeline to use the service connection](#authorize-pipelines).
   
1. Select **Save** or **Verify and save**.

The following example shows an Azure Resource Manager connection to an Azure subscription. You use the **Service connection name** as the `MyAzureSubscription1
` or equivalent subscription name value in pipeline tasks.

## View a service connection

To view information about a service connection, from your project select **Project settings** > **Service connections**, and select the service connection that you want to view.

- The **Overview** tab shows the details of the service connection, such as connection type, creator, and authentication type.

  :::image type="content" source="media/azure-overview-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Resource Manager overview page." lightbox="media/azure-overview-page.png":::

- The **Usage history** tab shows details about historical usage of the service connection.

  :::image type="content" source="media/azure-usage-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Resource Manager usage history." lightbox="media/azure-usage-history.png":::

- The **Approvals and checks** tab shows the [approvals and checks](../process/approvals.md) that allow a pipeline stage to use the service connection. To add approvals and checks, select the **+** symbol or **Add new**.

  :::image type="content" source="media/azure-approvals-checks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Resource Manager approvals and checks." lightbox="media/azure-approvals-checks.png":::

## Edit a service connection

- To edit service connection properties, select **Edit** on the service connection page. The parameters that you can edit depend on the service connection type and authentication method.

- You can also select **Security** or **Delete** on the **More options** menu. For more information about managing security permissions, see [Set service connection permissions](../policies/permissions.md#set-service-connection-security-in-azure-pipelines).

- To edit existing approvals and checks, select from the **More options** menu next to the approval on the **Approvals and checks** tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-edit-service-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of ways to edit Azure Resource Manager service connection." lightbox="media/azure-edit-service-connection.png":::

## Use a service connection

To use the service connection in pipelines:

- For YAML pipelines, use the connection name in your code as the `azureSubscription` or other connection name value.

  :::image type="content" source="media/yaml-connection-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of YAML service connection setting.":::

<a id="classic"></a>
- For Classic pipelines, select the connection name in the **Azure subscription** or other connection name setting in your pipeline task.

  :::image type="content" source="media/ui-connection-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of classic service connection setting." lightbox="media/ui-connection-setting.png":::

### Authorize pipelines

- To authorize all pipelines to use the service connection, select the **Allow all pipelines to use this connection** option in the connection properties.

- To authorize a single pipeline to use the service connection:

  1. Select **Run pipeline** on the pipeline page to queue a manual build.
  1. The message **This pipeline needs permission to access a resource before this run can continue** appears. Select **View** next to the message.
  1. On the **Waiting for review** screen, select **Permit**, and on the confirmation screen, select **Permit** again.

  This action explicitly adds the pipeline as an authorized user of the service connection.

#### Service account option

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Server URL | Required. Cluster's API server URL. |
| Secret | Secret associated with the service account to be used for deployment. |
| Connection name | Required. The name you use to refer to the service connection in task properties. If you're using YAML, use the name as the **azureSubscription** or the equivalent subscription name value in the script. |
| Description | Optional. The description of the service connection. |
| Security | Optional. Select **Grant access permission to all pipelines** to allow all pipelines to use this connection. If you don't select this option, you must explicitly authorize the service connection for each pipeline that uses it. |

Use the following command to fetch the Server URL.

```
kubectl config view --minify -o 'jsonpath={.clusters[0].cluster.server}'
```

Use the following sequence of commands to fetch the Secret object required to connect and authenticate with the cluster.

```
kubectl get serviceAccounts <service-account-name> -n <namespace> -o 'jsonpath={.secrets[*].name}'
```

In the following command, replace the `service-account-secret-name` with the output of the previous command.

```
kubectl get secret <service-account-secret-name> -n <namespace> -o json
```

Copy and paste the Secret object fetched in YAML form into the Secret text-field.

> [!NOTE]
> When using the service account option, [ensure that a RoleBinding exists](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#kubectl-create-rolebinding), which grants permissions in the `edit` `ClusterRole` to the desired service account. This is needed so that the service account can be used by Azure Pipelines for creating objects in the chosen namespace.
