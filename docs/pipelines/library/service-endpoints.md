# Service endpoints for builds and releases

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015**

You will typically need to connect to external and remote services to execute tasks
for a build or deployment. For example, you may need to connect to your Microsoft Azure
subscription, to a different build server or file server, to an online continuous
integration environment, or to services you install on remote computers.

You can define endpoints in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or Team Foundation Server (TFS) that are available for use in all
your tasks. For example, you can create an endpoint for your Azure subscription
and use this endpoint name in an Azure Web Site Deployment task in a release definition.

You define and manage service endpoints from the Admin settings of your project.
* VSTS: `https://{account}.visualstudio.com/{teamproject}/_admin/_services`
* TFS: `https://{tfsserver}/{collection}/{teamproject}/_admin/_services`

Service endpoints are created at project scope. An endpoint created in one project is not visible in another project.

<a name="create-new"></a>

## Create a service endpoint

1. Open the **Services** page from the "settings" icon in the top menu bar.

   ![Opening the Services page](_img/new-service-endpoint-1.png)

1. Choose **+ New Service Endpoint** and select the type of endpoint you need. 

   ![Choosing a service endpoint type](_img/new-service-endpoint-2.png)

1. Fill in the parameters for the endpoint. The list of parameters differs for each  type of service endpoint - see the following list.

## Common endpoint types

VSTS and TFS support a variety of endpoint types by default. Some of these are described below:

* [Azure Classic service endpoint](#sep-azure-classic)
* [Azure Resource Manager service endpoint](#sep-azure-rm)
* [Azure Service Bus service endpoint](#sep-servbus)
* [Bitbucket Cloud service endpoint](#sep-bbucket)
* [Chef service endpoint](#sep-chef)
* [Docker Host service endpoint](#sep-dochost)
* [Docker Registry service endpoint](#sep-docreg)
* [External Git service endpoint](#sep-extgit)
* [Generic service endpoint](#sep-generic)
* [GitHub service endpoint](#sep-github)
* [GitHub Enterprise service endpoint](#sep-githubent)
* [Jenkins service endpoint](#sep-jenkins)
* [Kubernetes service endpoint](#sep-kuber)
* [npm service endpoint](#sep-npm)
* [NuGet service endpoint](#sep-nuget)
* [Service Fabric service endpoint](#sep-fabric)
* [SSH service endpoint](#sep-ssh)
* [Subversion service endpoint](#sep-subversion)
* [Team Foundation Server / VSTS service endpoint](#sep-tfsts)
* [Visual Studio App Center service endpoint](#sep-vsmobile)

After you enter the parameters when creating a service endpoint, validate the
connection. The validation link uses a REST call to the external service with
the information you entered, and indicates if the call succeeded.

<h3 id="sep-azure-classic">Azure Classic service endpoint</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Azure credentials or an Azure management certificate.
[How do I create a new service endpoint?](#create-new)

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| \[authentication type\] | Required. Select **Credentials** or **Certificate based**. |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this endpoint in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. |
| Environment | Required. Select **Azure Cloud**, **Azure Stack**, or one of the pre-defined [Azure Government Clouds](government-cloud.md) where your subscription is defined. |
| Subscription ID | Required. The GUID-like identifier for your Azure subscription (not the subscription name). You can copy this from the Azure portal. |
| Subscription Name | Required. The name of your Microsoft Azure subscription (account). |
| User name | Required for Credentials authentication. User name of a work or school account (for example @fabrikam.com). Microsoft accounts (for example @live or @hotmail) are not supported. |
| Password | Required for Credentials authentication. Password for the user specified above. |
| Management Certificate | Required for Certificate based authentication. Copy the value of the management certificate key from your [publish settings XML file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=312990) or the Azure portal. |

> If your subscription is defined in an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md), ensure your application meets the relevant compliance requirements before you configure a service endpoint.

<a name="sep-azure-rm-conditions"></a>

<h3 id="sep-azure-rm">Azure Resource Manager service endpoint</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Service Principal Authentication (SPA). The dialog offers two modes:

* **Automated subscription detection**. In this mode, VSTS and TFS will attempt to query Azure for all of the subscriptions and instances to which you have access using the credentials you are currently logged on with in VSTS or TFS (including Microsoft accounts and School or Work accounts). 
  If no subscriptions are shown, or subscriptions other than the one you want to use, you must sign out of VSTS or TFS and sign in again
  using the appropriate account credentials. For more information, see the [next section](#arm-auto-connect) of this topic.

* **Manual subscription definition**. In this mode, you must specify the service principal you want to use to connect to Azure. The service principal specifies the resources and the access levels that will be available over the connection.
  Use this approach when you need to connect to an Azure account using different credentials from those you are currently logged on with in VSTS or TFS.
  This is also a useful way to maximize security and limit access.
  For more information, see the [following section](#arm-manual-connect) of this topic.     

> **NOTE**: If you don't see any Azure subscriptions or instances, or you have problems validating the connection, see [Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service endpoints](../release/azure-rm-endpoint.md).

<a name="arm-auto-connect"></a>

**Automated subscription detection**. 

You cannot use this version of the dialog to connect to an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md) or [Azure Stack](azure-stack.md).

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this endpoint in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. |
| Subscription | Select an existing Azure subscription. If you don't see any Azure subscriptions or instances, see [Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service endpoints](../release/azure-rm-endpoint.md). |
| Resource Group | If required, restrict the scope to a specific resource group within the subscription. |
<p />

[How do I create a new service endpoint?](#create-new)

Selecting an existing subscription automatically creates a new Azure
service principal that is assigned the **Contributor** role and so, by default, has
access to all resources within the subscription. To maximize security when using this connection approach:

* Select the **Resource Group** to which you want to limit access in the dialog (see table above).
* Edit the service principal that is created in the Azure portal, **Subscriptions | Users | Roles** section afterwards. For more details, see
[Azure Active Directory for developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-developers-guide).
* Use the [manual subscription definition](#arm-manual-connect) approach and then restrict access rights by using a specific service principal.

<a name="arm-manual-connect"></a>
<a name="sep-azure-rm-existingsp"></a>

**Manual subscription definition**

You must use this version of the dialog when connecting to an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md) or [Azure Stack](azure-stack.md).

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this endpoint in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. |
| Environment | Required. Select **Azure Cloud**, [Azure Stack](azure-stack.md), or one of the pre-defined [Azure Government Clouds](government-cloud.md) where your subscription is defined. |
| Environment URL | Required for [Azure Stack](azure-stack.md). The management URL of your on-premises installation. |
| Subscription ID | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The GUID-like identifier for your Azure subscription (not the subscription name). [More information](#sep-azure-rm-createsp). |
| Subscription Name | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The name of your Microsoft Azure subscription (account). [More information](#sep-azure-rm-createsp). |
| Service Principal ID | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The Azure Active Directory client application ID for the account. [More information](#sep-azure-rm-createsp). |
| Service Principal Key | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The Azure Active Directory client authentication key for the account. [More information](#sep-azure-rm-createsp). |
| Tenant ID | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The ID of the client tenant in Azure Active Directory. [More information](#sep-azure-rm-createsp). |
<p />

[How do I create a new service endpoint?](#create-new)

You will typically use an existing service principal that has restricted scope.
You can allocate service principal permissions at the subscription level, resource group level, or resource level. For details of how to restrict
a service principal's access rights by using Role-Based Access Control
([RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles)) roles, see
[Use portal to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal).

<a name="sep-azure-rm-createsp"></a>
**To use the manual subscription definition dialog:**

1. [Create a new service endpoint](#create-new) and select **Azure Resource Manager**.
1. Download and run [this PowerShell script](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-rm-extensions/blob/master/TaskModules/powershell/Azure/SPNCreation.ps1) in an Azure PowerShell window.
   When prompted, enter your subscription name, password, role (optional), and the type of cloud such as Azure Cloud (the default), Azure Stack, or an Azure Government Cloud.
1. Switch from the simplified version of the dialog to the full version using the link in the dialog.

   ![Opening the full version of the service endpoint dialog](_img/rm-endpoint-link.png)

1. Enter a user-friendly name to use when referring to this service endpoint connection.
1. Select the Environment name (such as Azure Cloud, Azure Stack, or an Azure Government Cloud).
1. Enter the Environment URL if required. For Azure Stack, this will be something like `https://management.local.azurestack.external`
1. Copy these fields from the output of the PowerShell script into the Azure subscription dialog textboxes:
   - Subscription ID
   - Subscription Name
   - Service Principal ID
   - Service Principal Key
   - Tenant ID<p/>

## Extensions for other endpoints

Other service endpoint types and tasks can be installed in VSTS
and Team Foundation Server as extensions. Some examples of service endpoints currently
available through extensions are:

* [TFS artifacts for Release Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.vss-services-externaltfs).
  Deploy on-premises TFS builds with VSTS
  Release Management through a TFS service endpoint
  connection and the **Team Build (external)** artifact,
  even when the TFS machine is not reachable directly
  from VSTS. For more information, see
  [External TFS](../release/artifacts.md#onpremtfssource) and
  [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/04/05/deploy-artifacts-from-onprem-tfs-server-with-release-management-service/).

* [TeamCity artifacts for Release Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vss-services-teamcity).
  This extension provides integration with TeamCity through a TeamCity service endpoint,
  enabling artifacts produced in TeamCity to be deployed
  by using Release Management. See
  [TeamCity](../release/artifacts.md#teamcitysource)
  for more details.

* [SCVMM Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.scvmmapp).
  Connect to a System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) server to easily
  provision virtual machines and perform actions on
  them such as managing checkpoints, starting and
  stopping VMs, and running PowerShell scripts.

* [VMware Resource Deployment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.vmwareapp).
  Connect to a VMware vCenter Server from Visual Studio Team
  Services or Team Foundation Server to provision,
  start, stop, or snapshot VMware virtual machines.

For information about creating your own custom extensions, see
[Overview of extensions for VSTS](../../integrate/index.md).

<h2 id="security">Endpoint security</h2>

You can control who can define new service endpoints in a library, and who can use an existing service endpoint. **Roles** are defined for  service endpoints, and **membership** in these roles governs the operations you can perform on those endpoints.

| Role on a library service endpoint | Purpose |
|------------------------------------|---------|
| User | Members of this role can use the endpoint when authoring build or release definitions. |
| Administrator | In addition to using the endpoint, members of this role can manage membership of all other roles for the service endpoint. The user that created the service endpoint is automatically added to the Administrator role for that service endpoint.

Two special groups called **Endpoint administrators** and **Endpoint creators** are added to every project. 
Members of the Endpoint administrators group can manage all endpoints. By default, project administrators are added as members of this group. This group is also added as an administrator to every endpoint created.
Members of the Endpoint creators group can create new endpoints. By default, project contributors are added as members of this group.
