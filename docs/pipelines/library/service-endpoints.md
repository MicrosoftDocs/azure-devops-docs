You can create a connection from Azure Pipelines to external and remote services for executing tasks in a job. Once you establish a connection, you can view, edit, and add security to the service connection.

For example, you might want to connect to one of the following categories and their services.

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription: Create a service connection with your Microsoft Azure subscription and use the name of the service connection in an Azure Web Site Deployment task in a release pipeline.
* A different build server or file server: Create a standard GitHub Enterprise Server service connection to a GitHub repository.
* An online continuous integration environment: Create a Jenkins service connection for continuous integration of Git repositories.
* Services installed on remote computers: Create an Azure Resource Manager service connection to a VM with a managed service identity.
  
> [!TIP]
> The Azure Resource Manager service connection is a single example of a service connection. For more information, see [Common service connection types](#common-service-connection-types).

## Prerequisites

You can create, view, use, and manage a service connection based on your assigned user roles. For more information, see [User permissions](#user-permissions).

## Create a service connection

::: moniker-end

Based on usage patterns, service connection security is divided into the following categories. Edit permissions as desired.

* [User permissions](#user-permissions)
* [Pipeline permissions](#pipeline-permissions)
* [Project permissions](#project-permissions---cross-project-sharing-of-service-connections)

    :::image type="content" source="../release/_img/azure-rm-endpoint/azure-rm-security.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Azure Resource Manager security.":::

### User permissions

Control who can create, view, use, and manage a service connection with user roles. In **Project settings** > **Service connections**, you can set the hub-level permissions, which are inherited. You can also override the roles for each service connection.

| Role on a service connection | Purpose |
|------------------------------------|---------|
| Creator | Members of this role can create the service connection in the project. Contributors are added as members by default|
| Reader | Members of this role can view the service connection. |
| User | Members of this role can use the service connection when authoring build or release pipelines or authorize yaml pipelines. |
| Administrator | Members of this role can use the service connection and manage membership of all other roles for the project's service connection. Project Administrators are added as members by default. |

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!NOTE]
> Previously, Endpoint Creator and Endpoint Administrator groups were used to control who could create and manage service connections. We've moved to the pure RBAC model, which uses roles.
For backward compatibility in existing projects, the Endpoint Administrator group is now the Administrator role and the Endpoint Creator group is the Creator role, which ensures there's no change in the behavior for existing service connections.
>
>We've also introduced **Sharing of service connections across projects**. With this feature, service connections now become an organization-level object, however scoped to your current project by default. In **User permissions**, you can see **Project**- and **Organization**- level permissions. The functionality of the Administrator role is split between the two permission levels.

::: moniker-end

#### Project-level permissions

The project-level permissions are the user permissions with reader, user, creator and administrator roles, as explained above, within the project scope. You have inheritance and you can set the roles at the hub level and for each service connection.

The project-level Administrator can do the following tasks:

* Manage other users and roles at the project-level
* Rename a service connection and update the description
* Delete a service connection, which removes it from the project

![Azure Resource Manager project security](../release/_img/azure-rm-endpoint/azure-rm-project-level-security.png)

The user who created the service connection is automatically added to the Administrator role for that service connection. Users and groups assigned the Administrator role at the hub-level are inherited if the inheritance is turned on.

#### Organization-level permissions

Any permissions set at the organization-level reflect across all the projects where the service connection is shared. There's no inheritance for organization-level permissions.

The organization-level Administrator can do the following administrative tasks:

* Manage organization-level users
* Edit all the fields of a service connection
* Share and unshare a service connection with other projects

![Azure Resource Manager organization security](../release/_img/azure-rm-endpoint/azure-rm-organization-security.png)

The user who created the service connection is automatically added as an organization-level Administrator role for that service connection. In all existing service connections, the connection Administrators are made organization-level Administrators.

### Pipeline permissions

Pipeline permissions control which YAML pipelines are authorized to use the service connection. Pipeline permissions do not restrict access from Classic pipelines.

You can choose from the following options:

* Open access for all pipelines to consume the service connection from the more options at top-right corner of the **Pipeline permissions** section in security tab of a service connection.

* Lock down the service connection and only allow selected YAML pipelines to consume the service connection. If any other YAML pipeline refers to the service connection, an authorization request gets raised, which must be approved by a connection Administrator. This does not limit access from Classic pipelines.

![Azure Resource Manager pipeline permissions](../release/_img/azure-rm-endpoint/azure-rm-pipeline-permissions.png)

### Project permissions - Cross project sharing of service connections

Project permissions control which projects can use the service connection. By default, service connections aren't shared with any other projects.

* Only the organization-level administrators from **User permissions** can share the service connection with other projects.
* The user who's sharing the service connection with a project should have at least Create service connection permission in the target project.
* The user who shares the service connection with a project becomes the project-level Administrator for that service connection. The project-level inheritance is set to *on* in the target project.
* The service connection name is appended with the project name and it can be renamed in the target project scope.
* Organization-level administrator can unshare a service connection from any shared project.

![Azure Resource Manager project permissions](../release/_img/azure-rm-endpoint/azure-rm-project-permissions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The project permissions feature is dependent on the new service connections UI. When we enable this feature, the old service
> connections UI will no longer be usable.

## Use a service connection

Once you've [created your service connection](#create-a-service-connection), complete the following steps to use it.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

1. Copy the connection name into your code as the **azureSubscription** (or the equivalent connection name) value.

  ![If you're using YAML.](media/yaml-connection-setting.png)

<a id="classic"></a>

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

1. Select the connection name you assigned in the **Azure subscription** (or the equivalent connection name) setting of your pipeline.

  ![If you're using the UI.](media/ui-connection-setting.png)

---

1. Authorize the service connection using one of the following techniques:

* To authorize any pipeline to use the service connection, go to Azure Pipelines, open the Settings page, select Service connections, and enable the setting **Allow all pipelines to use this connection** option for the connection.

* To authorize a service connection for a specific pipeline, open the pipeline
  by selecting **Edit** and queue a build manually. You see a resource authorization error
  and an "Authorize resources" action on the error. Choose this action to explicitly add the pipeline as an
  authorized user of the service connection.

You can also create your own [custom service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Service connections can't be specified by variables.

## Common service connection types

Azure Pipelines supports the following service connection types by default:

[Azure Classic](#azure-classic-service-connection) | [Azure Repos/TFS](#azure-repos) | [Azure Resource Manager](#azure-resource-manager-service-connection) | [Azure Service Bus](#azure-service-bus-service-connection) | [Bitbucket](#bitbucket-cloud-service-connection) | [Chef](#chef-service-connection) | [Docker hub or others](#docker-hub-or-others) | [Other Git](#other-git-service-connection) | [Generic](#generic-service-connection) | [GitHub](#github-service-connection) | [GitHub Enterprise Server](#github-enterprise-server-service-connection) | [Jenkins](#jenkins-service-connection) | [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-service-connection) | [Maven](#maven-service-connection) | [npm](#npm-service-connection) | [NuGet](#nuget-service-connection) | [Python package download](#python-package-download-service-connection) | [Python package upload](#python-package-upload-service-connection) | [Service Fabric](#service-fabric-service-connection) | [SSH](#ssh-service-connection) | [Subversion](#subversion-service-connection) | [Visual Studio App Center](#visual-studio-app-center-service-connection) |

### Azure Classic service connection

Use the following parameters to define and secure a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription, using Azure credentials or an Azure management certificate.

[How do I create a new service connection?](#create-a-service-connection)

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| \[authentication type\] | Required. Select **Credentials** or **Certificate based**. |
| Connection name | Required. The name you use to refer to the service connection in task properties. It's not the name of your Azure account or subscription. If you're using YAML, use the name as the **azureSubscription** or the equivalent subscription name value in the script. |
| Environment | Required. Select **Azure Cloud**, **Azure Stack**, or one of the predefined [Azure Government Clouds](/azure/azure-government/connect-with-azure-pipelines) where your subscription is defined. |
| Subscription ID | Required. The GUID-like identifier for your Azure subscription (not the subscription name). You can copy the subscription ID from the Azure portal. |
| Subscription name | Required. The name of your Microsoft Azure subscription. |
| User name | Required for Credentials authentication. User name of a work or school account (for example @fabrikam.com). Microsoft accounts (for example @live or @hotmail) are't supported. |
| Password | Required for Credentials authentication. Password for the user specified above. |
| Management certificate | Required for Certificate-based authentication. Copy the value of the management certificate key from your [publish settings XML file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=312990) or the Azure portal. |

If your subscription is defined in an [Azure Government Cloud](/azure/azure-government/connect-with-azure-pipelines), ensure your application meets the relevant compliance requirements before you configure a service connection.

### Azure Repos

Use the following parameters to define and secure a connection to another Azure DevOps organization.

| Parameter | Description  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|(authentication) |  Select **Basic** or **Token Based** authentication.|
| Connection name | Required. The name you use to refer to the service connection in task properties. This isn't the name of your Azure account or subscription. If you're using YAML, use the name as the **azureSubscription** or the equivalent subscription name value in the script. |
| Connection URL  |  Required. The URL of the TFS or the other Azure DevOps organization.|
| User name | Required for Basic authentication. The username to connect to the service.|
| Password  |  Required for Basic authentication. The password for the specified username.|
| Personal Access Token | Required for Token Based authentication (TFS 2017 and newer and Azure Pipelines only). The token to use to authenticate with the service. [Learn more](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md). |

Use the **Verify connection** link to validate your connection information.

For more information, see [Authenticate access with personal access tokens for Azure DevOps](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md).

### Azure Resource Manager service connection

Use the following parameters to define and secure a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Service Principal Authentication (SPA) or an Azure managed Service Identity.
The dialog offers two main modes:

* **Automated subscription detection**. In this mode, Azure Pipelines queries Azure for all of the subscriptions and instances to which you have access. They use the credentials you're currently signed in with in Azure Pipelines (including Microsoft accounts and School or Work accounts).
  
If you don't see the subscription you want to use, sign out of Azure Pipelines and sign in again using the appropriate account credentials.

* **Manual subscription pipeline**. In this mode, you must specify the service principal you want to use to connect to Azure. The service principal specifies the resources and the access levels that are available over the connection.

Use this approach when you need to connect to an Azure account using different credentials from the credentials you're currently signed in with in Azure Pipelines. It's useful way to maximize security and limit access. Service principals are valid for two years.

For more information, see [Connect to Microsoft Azure](connect-to-azure.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see any Azure subscriptions or instances, or you have problems validating the connection, see [Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service connections](../release/azure-rm-endpoint.md).

### Azure Service Bus service connection

Use the following parameters to define and secure a connection to a Microsoft Azure Service Bus queue.

| Parameter  | Description  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

> This option lists all the subscriptions the service connection creator has access to *across different Azure tenants*. If you can't see subscriptions from other Azure tenants, check your Azure AD permissions in those tenants.

#### Service account option

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection name | Required. The name you use to refer to the service connection in task inputs. |
| Server URL | Required. Cluster's API server URL. |
| Secret | Secret associated with the service account to be used for deployment |

Use the following command to fetch the Server URL.

```
kubectl config view --minify -o 'jsonpath={.clusters[0].cluster.server}'
```

Use the following sequence of commands to fetch the Secret object that's required to connect and authenticate with the cluster.

```
kubectl get serviceAccounts <service-account-name> -n <namespace> -o 'jsonpath={.secrets[*].name}'
```

In the following command, replace the `service-account-secret-name` with the output of the previous command.

```
kubectl get secret <service-account-secret-name> -n <namespace> -o json
```

Copy and paste the Secret object fetched in YAML form into the Secret text-field.

> [!NOTE]
> When using the service account option, [ensure that a RoleBinding exists](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#kubectl-create-rolebinding), which grants permissions in the `edit` `ClusterRole` to the desired service account. This is needed so that the service account can be used by Azure Pipelines for creating objects in the chosen namespace.
