You will typically need to connect to external and remote services to execute tasks
in a job. For example, you may need to connect to your Microsoft Azure
subscription, to a different build server or file server, to an online continuous
integration environment, or to services you install on remote computers.

You can define service connections in Azure Pipelines or Team Foundation Server (TFS) that are available for use in all
your tasks. For example, you can create a service connection for your Azure subscription
and use this service connection name in an Azure Web Site Deployment task in a release pipeline.

You define and manage service connections from the Admin settings of your project:

* Azure DevOps: `https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_settings/adminservices`
* TFS: `https://{tfsserver}/{collection}/{project}/_admin/_services`

<a name="create-new"></a>

## Create a service connection

1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Service connections** page from the [project settings page](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).
   In TFS, open the **Services** page from the "settings" icon in the top menu bar.

1. Choose **+ New service connection** and select the type of service connection you need.

1. Fill in the parameters for the service connection. The list of parameters differs for each type of service connection - see the [following list](#ep-types).
   
1. Decide if you want the service connection to be accessible for any pipeline by
   setting the **Allow all pipelines to use this connection** option. This option allows pipelines
   defined in YAML, which are not automatically authorized for service connections,
   to use this service connection. See [Use a service connection](#use-connection).

1. Choose **OK** to create the connection.
For example, this is the default **Azure Resource Manager** connection dialog:

   ![Azure Resource Manager connection dialog](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/new-connection-01.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The connection dialog may appear different for the different types of service connections, 
   > and have different parameters. See the list of parameters in 
   > [Common service connection types](#common-service-connection-types) for each
   > service connection type.

## Manage a service connection

1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Service connections** page from the [project settings page](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).
   Or, in TFS, open the **Services** page from the "settings" icon in the top menu bar.

1. Select the service connection you want to manage.

1. You will land in the **Overview** tab of the service connection where you can see the details of the service connection i.e. type, creator, authentication type (like Token, Username/Password or OAuth etc.).
![Azure Resource Manager connection overview](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/overview-page.png)

1. Next to the overview tab, you can see **Usage history** that shows the list of pipelines using the service connection.
![Azure Resource Manager usage history](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/usage-history.png)

1. To update the service connection, click on **Edit** at the top-right corner of the page.

1. **Approvals and checks**, **Security** and **Delete** are part of the more options at the top-right corner.
![Azure Resource Manager more options](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/more-options.png)

<a name="security"></a>

## Secure a service connection

To manage the security for a connection:

1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Service connections** page from the [project settings page](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).
   In TFS, open the **Services** page from the "settings" icon in the top menu bar.

1. To manage user permissions at hub level, go to the more options at the top-right corner and choose **Security**.
![Service connection hub security](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/service-connection-hub-security.png)

1. To manage security for a service connection, open the service connection and go to more options at top-right corner and choose **Security**.
![Azure Resource Manager security](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/security.png)

Service connection is a critical resource for various workflows in Azure DevOps like Classic Build and Release pipelines, YAML pipelines, KevVault Variable groups etc. Based on the usage patterns, service connection security is divided into three categories in the service connections new UI.
* User permissions
* Pipeline permissions
* Project permissions

### User permissions
You can control who can create, view, use and manage the service connection with user permissions. You have four roles i.e. Creator, Reader, User and Administrator roles to manage each of these actions. In the service connections tab, you can set the hub level permissions which are inherited and you can override the roles for each service connection. 

| Role on a service connection | Purpose |
|------------------------------------|---------|
| Creator | Members of this role can create the service connection in the project. Contributors are added as members by default|
| Reader | Members of this role can view the service connection. |
| User | Members of this role can use the service connection when authoring build or release pipelines or authorize yaml pipelines. |
| Administrator | In addition to using the service connection, members of this role can manage membership of all other roles for the service connection in the project. Project administrators are added as members by default |

Previously, two special groups, Endpoint Creators and Endpoint Administrator groups were used to control who can create and manage service connections. Now, as part of service connection new UI, we are moving to pure RBAC model i.e. using roles.
For backward compatibility, in the existing projects, Endpoint Administrators group is added as Administrator role and Endpoint creators group is assigned with creator role which ensures there is no change in the behavior for existing service connections. 

> [!NOTE]
> This change is applicable only in Azure DevOps Services where new UI is available. 
> Azure DevOps Server 2019 and older versions still follow the previous security model.

Along with the new service connections UI, we are introducing **Sharing of service connections across projects**. With this feature, service connections now become an organization level object however scoped to current project by default. In User permissions section, you can see **Project** and **Organization** level permissions. And the functionalities of administrator role are split between the two levels.

#### Project level permissions
The project level permissions are the user permissions with reader, user, creator and administrator roles, as explained above, within the project scope. You have inheritance and you can set the roles at the hub level as well as for each service connection. 

The project-level administrator has limited administrative capabilities as below:
* A project-level administrator can manage other users and roles at project scope.
* A project-level administrator can rename a service connection, update description and enable/disable "Allow pipeline access" flag.
* A project-level administrator can delete a service connection which removes the existence of service connection from the project.

![Azure Resource Manager project security](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/project-level-security.png)

The user that created the service connection is automatically added to the project level Administrator role for that service connection. And users/groups assigned administrator role at hub level are inherited if the inheritance is turned on.

#### Organization level permissions
Organization level permissions are introduced along with cross project sharing feature. Any permissions set at this level are reflected across all the projects where the service connection is shared. There is not inheritance for organization level permissions. Today we only have administrator role at organization level.

The organization-level administrator has all the administrative capabilities that include:
* An organization-level administrator can manage organization level users.
* An organization-level administrator can edit all the fields of a service connection.
* An organization-level administrator can share/un-share a service connection with other projects.

![Azure Resource Manager organization security](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/organization-security.png)

The user that created the service connection is automatically added as an organization level Administrator role for that service connection. In all the existing service connections, for backward compatibility, all the connection administrators are made organization-level administrators to ensure there is no change in the behavior.


### Pipeline permissions
Pipeline permissions control which YAML pipelines are authorized to use this service connection. This is interlinked with 'Allow pipeline access' checkbox you find in service connection creation dialogue.

You can either choose to open access for all pipelines to consume this service connection from the more options at top-right corner of the **Pipeline permissions** section in security tab of a service connection.

Or you can choose to lock down the service connection and only allow selected YAML pipelines to consume this service connection. If any other YAML pipeline refers to this service connection, an authorization request is raised which has to be approved by the connection administrators.

![Azure Resource Manager pipeline permissions](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/pipeline-permissions.png)

### Project permissions - Cross project sharing of service connections

* Only the organization-level administrators from **User permissions** can share the service connection with other projects.
* The user who is sharing the service connection with a project should have atleast create service connection permission in the target project.
* The user who shares the service connection with a project becomes the project-level administrator for that service connection  and the project-level inheritance is turned on in the target project.
* The service connection name is appended with the project name and it can be renamed in the target project scope.
* Organization level administrator can unshare a service connection from any shared project.

![Azure Resource Manager project permissions](../release/media/azure-rm-endpoint/project-permissions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The sharing feature is still under preview and is not yet rolled out. If you want this feature enabled, you can reach out to us.
> Project permissions feature is dependent on the new service connections UI and once we enable this feature, the old service
> connections UI is no longer usable.

## Use a service connection

After the new service connection is created:

<a id="yaml"></a>

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

Copy the connection name into your code as the **azureSubscription** (or the equivalent connection name) value.

  ![If you are using it in YAML](media/yaml-connection-setting.png)

<a id="classic"></a>

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

Select the connection name you assigned in the **Azure subscription** (or the equivalent connection name) setting of your pipeline.

  ![If you are using it in the UI](media/ui-connection-setting.png)

---

Next you must authorize the service connection.
To do this, or if you encounter a resource authorization error in your build,
use one of the following techniques:

- If you want to authorize any pipeline to use the service connection,
  go to Azure Pipelines, open the Settings page, select Service connections,
  and enable the setting **Allow all pipelines to use this connection** option for the connection.

- If you want to authorize a service connection for a specific pipeline, open the pipeline
  by selecting **Edit** and queue a build manually. You will see a resource authorization error
  and an "Authorize resources" action on the error. Choose this action to explicitly add the pipeline as an
  authorized user of the service connection.

> You can also create your own [custom service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Service connection cannot be specified by variable

<a name="ep-types"></a>

## Common service connection types

Azure Pipelines and TFS support a variety of service connection types by default. Some of these are described below:

- [Service connections](#service-connections)
  - [Create a service connection](#create-a-service-connection)
  - [Manage a service connection](#manage-a-service-connection)
  - [Secure a service connection](#secure-a-service-connection)
    - [User permissions](#user-permissions)
      - [Project level permissions](#project-level-permissions)
      - [Organization level permissions](#organization-level-permissions)
    - [Pipeline permissions](#pipeline-permissions)
    - [Project permissions - Cross project sharing of service connections](#project-permissions---cross-project-sharing-of-service-connections)
  - [Use a service connection](#use-a-service-connection)
- [YAML](#yaml)
- [Classic](#classic)
  - [Common service connection types](#common-service-connection-types)
  - [Extensions for other service connections](#extensions-for-other-service-connections)

After you enter the parameters when creating a service connection, validate the
connection. The validation link uses a REST call to the external service with
the information you entered, and indicates if the call succeeded.

<h3 id="sep-azure-classic">Azure Classic service connection</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Azure credentials or an Azure management certificate.
[How do I create a new service connection?](#create-new)

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| \[authentication type\] | Required. Select **Credentials** or **Certificate based**. |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this service connection in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. If you are using YAML, use this name as the **azureSubscription** or the equivalent subscription name value in the script. |
| Environment | Required. Select **Azure Cloud**, **Azure Stack**, or one of the pre-defined [Azure Government Clouds](government-cloud.md) where your subscription is defined. |
| Subscription ID | Required. The GUID-like identifier for your Azure subscription (not the subscription name). You can copy this from the Azure portal. |
| Subscription Name | Required. The name of your Microsoft Azure subscription (account). |
| User name | Required for Credentials authentication. User name of a work or school account (for example @fabrikam.com). Microsoft accounts (for example @live or @hotmail) are not supported. |
| Password | Required for Credentials authentication. Password for the user specified above. |
| Management Certificate | Required for Certificate-based authentication. Copy the value of the management certificate key from your [publish settings XML file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=312990) or the Azure portal. |

> If your subscription is defined in an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md), ensure your application meets the relevant compliance requirements before you configure a service connection.

<h3 id="sep-azure-resource-manager">Azure Resource Manager service connection</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Service Principal Authentication (SPA) or an Azure-Managed Service Identity.
The dialog offers two main modes:

* **Automated subscription detection**. In this mode, Azure Pipelines and TFS will attempt to query Azure for all of the subscriptions and instances to which you have access using the credentials you are currently logged on with in Azure Pipelines or TFS (including Microsoft accounts and School or Work accounts).
  If no subscriptions are shown, or subscriptions other than the one you want to use, you must sign out of Azure Pipelines or TFS and sign in again
  using the appropriate account credentials.

* **Manual subscription pipeline**. In this mode, you must specify the service principal you want to use to connect to Azure. The service principal specifies the resources and the access levels that will be available over the connection.
  Use this approach when you need to connect to an Azure account using different credentials from those you are currently logged on with in Azure Pipelines or TFS.
  This is also a useful way to maximize security and limit access.

For more information, see [Connect to Microsoft Azure](connect-to-azure.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see any Azure subscriptions or instances, or you have problems validating the connection, see [Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service connections](../release/azure-rm-endpoint.md).

<h3 id="sep-kuber">Kubernetes service connection</h3>

Defines a connection to a Kubernetes cluster.

**Azure subscription option**

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this service connection in task inputs. |
| Azure subscription | Required. The Azure subscription containing the cluster to be used for service connection creation.  |
| Cluster | Name of the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. |
| Namespace | Namespace within the cluster. |

For an RBAC enabled cluster, a ServiceAccount is created in the chosen namespace along with RoleBinding object so that the created ServiceAccount is able to perform actions only on the chosen namespace.

For an RBAC disabled cluster, a ServiceAccount is created in the chosen namespace. But the created ServiceAccount has cluster-wide privileges (across namespaces).

> [!NOTE]
> This option lists all the subscriptions the service connection creator has access to *across different Azure tenants*. If you are unable to see subscriptions from other Azure tenants, please check your AAD permissions in those tenants.

**Service account option**

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this service connection in task inputs. |
| Server URL | Required. Cluster's API server URL.  |
| Secret | Secret associated with the service account to be used for deployment |

The following command can be used to fetch Server URL - 

```
kubectl config view --minify -o 'jsonpath={.clusters[0].cluster.server}'
```
For fetching Secret object required to connect and authenticate with the cluster, the following sequence of commands need to be run -

```
kubectl get serviceAccounts <service-account-name> -n <namespace> -o 'jsonpath={.secrets[*].name}'
```   

The above command fetches the name of the secret associated with a ServiceAccount. The output of the above command is to be substituted in the following command for fetching Secret object - 

```
kubectl get secret <service-account-secret-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
```

Copy and paste the Secret object fetched in YAML form into the Secret text-field.

> [!NOTE]
> When using the service account option, [ensure that a RoleBinding exists](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#kubectl-create-rolebinding), which grants permissions in the `edit` `ClusterRole` to the desired service account. This is needed so that the service account can be used by Azure Pipelines for creating objects in the chosen namespace.

**Kubeconfig option**

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this service connection in task inputs. |
| Kubeconfig | Required. Contents of the kubeconfig file  |
| Context | Context within the kubeconfig file that is to be used for identifying the cluster |

## Extensions for other service connections

Other service connection types and tasks can be installed in Azure Pipelines
and Team Foundation Server as extensions. Some examples of service connections currently
available through extensions are:

* [TFS artifacts for Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.vss-services-externaltfs).
  Deploy on-premises TFS builds with Azure Pipelines
  through a TFS service connection and the **Team Build (external)** artifact,
  even when the TFS machine is not reachable directly
  from Azure Pipelines. For more information, see
  [External TFS](../release/artifacts.md#onpremtfssource) and
  [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/deploy-artifacts-from-onprem-tfs-server-with-release-management-service/).

* [TeamCity artifacts for Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vss-services-teamcity).
  This extension provides integration with TeamCity through a TeamCity service connection,
  enabling artifacts produced in TeamCity to be deployed
  by using Azure Pipelines. See
  [TeamCity](../release/artifacts.md#teamcitysource)
  for more details.

* [SCVMM Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.scvmmapp).
  Connect to a System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) server to easily
  provision virtual machines and perform actions on
  them such as managing checkpoints, starting and
  stopping VMs, and running PowerShell scripts.

* [VMware Resource Deployment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.vmwareapp).
  Connect to a VMware vCenter Server from Visual Studio Team
  Services or Team Foundation Server to provision,
  start, stop, or snapshot VMware virtual machines.

> You can also create your own [custom service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md).
