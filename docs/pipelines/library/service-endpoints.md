You will typically need to connect to external and remote services to execute tasks
in a job. For example, you may need to connect to your Microsoft Azure
subscription, to a different build server or file server, to an online continuous
integration environment, or to services you install on remote computers.

You can define service connections in Azure Pipelines or Team Foundation Server (TFS) that are available for use in all
your tasks. For example, you can create a service connection for your Azure subscription
and use this service connection name in an Azure Web Site Deployment task in a release pipeline.

You define and manage service connections from the Admin settings of your project:

* Azure DevOps: `https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_admin/_services`
* TFS: `https://{tfsserver}/{collection}/{project}/_admin/_services`

Service connections are created at project scope. A service connection created in one project is not visible in another project.

<a name="create-new"></a>

## Create a service connection

1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Service connections** page from the [project settings page](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).
   In TFS, open the **Services** page from the "settings" icon in the top menu bar.

1. Choose **+ New service connection** and select the type of service connection you need.

1. Fill in the parameters for the service connection. The list of parameters differs for each type of service connection - see the [following list](#ep-types).
   For example, this is the default **Azure Resource Manager** connection dialog:

   ![Azure Resource Manager connection dialog](../release/_img/azure-rm-endpoint/azure-rm-endpoint-01.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The connection dialog may appear different for the different types of service connections, 
   > and have different parameters. See the list of parameters in 
   > [Common service connection types](#common-service-connection-types) for each
   > service connection type.

1. Decide if you want the service connection to be accessible for any pipeline by
   setting the **Allow all pipelines to use this connection** option. This option allows pipelines
   defined in YAML, which are not automatically authorized for service connections,
   to use this service connection. See [Use a service connection](#use-connection).

1. Choose **OK** to create the connection.

> For more information about Azure Resource Manager service connections, see [Connect to Microsoft Azure](connect-to-azure.md).
> You can also create your own [custom service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md).

## Manage a service connection

1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Service connections** page from the [project settings page](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).
   Or, in TFS, open the **Services** page from the "settings" icon in the top menu bar.

1. Select the service connection you want to manage.

1. Choose from the list of **Actions** in the **Details** tab in the right pane.

The actions available depend on the chosen type of connection. You can update only
some properties of connections; for example, to change the selected subscription
you must re-create the connection. Choose **Disconnect** to delete or remove a connection.

<a name="security"></a>

## Secure a service connection

You can control who can define new service connections in a library, and who can use an existing service connection.
**Roles** are defined for  service connections, and **membership** in these roles governs the operations you can perform on those service connections.

| Role on a library service connection | Purpose |
|------------------------------------|---------|
| User | Members of this role can use the service connection when authoring build or release pipelines. |
| Administrator | In addition to using the service connection, members of this role can manage membership of all other roles for the service connection. The user that created the service connection is automatically added to the Administrator role for that service connection.

Two special groups for service connections, endpoint administrators and creators, are added to every project.
Members of the administrators group can manage all service connections.
By default, project administrators are added as members of this group.
This group is also added as an administrator to every service connection created.
Members of the creators group can create new service connections.
By default, project contributors are added as members of this group.

To modify the security for a connection:

1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Service connections** page from the [project settings page](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#open-project-settings).
   In TFS, open the **Services** page from the "settings" icon in the top menu bar.

1. Choose the **Roles** link to open the security tab.

   ![Editing the roles](_img/endpoint-roles.png)

1. Add users or groups, turn on and off inheritance, or change the role for existing users and groups as required.

> For more information about securing an Azure Resource Manager service connection, see [Connect to Microsoft Azure](connect-to-azure.md).

<a name="use-connection"></a>

## Use a service connection

After the new service connection is created:

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

Copy the connection name into your code as the **azureSubscription** (or the equivalent connection name) value.

  ![If you are using it in YAML](_img/yaml-connection-setting.png)
# [Classic](#tab/classic)

Select the connection name you assigned in the **Azure subscription** (or the equivalent connection name) setting of your pipeline.

  ![If you are using it in the UI](_img/ui-connection-setting.png)

---

Next you must authorize the service connection.
To do this, or if you encounter a resource authorization error in your build,
use one of the following techniques:

- If you want to authorize any pipeline to use the service connection,
  go to Azure Pipelines, open the Settings page, select Service connections,
  and enable the setting **Allow all pipelines to use this connection** option for the connection.

- If you want to authorize a service connection for a specific pipeline, open the pipeline
  by selecting **Edit** and queue a build manually. You will see a resource authorization error
  and a "Authorize resources" action on the error. Choose this action to explicitly add the pipeline as an
  authorized user of the service connection.

> You can also create your own [custom service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md).

<a name="ep-types"></a>

## Common service connection types

Azure Pipelines and TFS support a variety of service connection types by default. Some of these are described below:

* [Azure Classic service connection](#sep-azure-classic)
* [Azure Resource Manager service connection](#sep-azure-rm)
* [Azure Service Bus service connection](#sep-servbus)
* [Bitbucket Cloud service connection](#sep-bbucket)
* [Chef service connection](#sep-chef)
* [Docker Host service connection](#sep-dochost)
* [Docker Registry service connection](#sep-docreg)
* [External Git service connection](#sep-extgit)
* [Generic service connection](#sep-generic)
* [GitHub service connection](#sep-github)
* [GitHub Enterprise Server service connection](#sep-githubent)
* [Jenkins service connection](#sep-jenkins)
* [Kubernetes service connection](#sep-kuber)
* [Maven service connection](#sep-maven)
* [npm service connection](#sep-npm)
* [NuGet service connection](#sep-nuget)
* [Python package download service connection](#sep-python-download)
* [Python package upload service connection](#sep-python-upload)
* [Service Fabric service connection](#sep-fabric)
* [SSH service connection](#sep-ssh)
* [Subversion service connection](#sep-subversion)
* [Team Foundation Server / Azure Pipelines service connection](#sep-tfsts)
* [Visual Studio App Center service connection](#sep-vsmobile)

After you enter the parameters when creating a service connection, validate the
connection. The validation link uses a REST call to the external service with
the information you entered, and indicates if the call succeeded.

<h3 id="sep-azure-classic">Azure Classic service connection</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Azure credentials or an Azure management certificate.
[How do I create a new service connection?](#create-new)

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| \[authentication type\] | Required. Select **Credentials** or **Certificate based**. |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this service connection in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. If you are using YAML, use this name as the **azureSubscription** or the equivalent subscription name value in the script. |
| Environment | Required. Select **Azure Cloud**, **Azure Stack**, or one of the pre-defined [Azure Government Clouds](government-cloud.md) where your subscription is defined. |
| Subscription ID | Required. The GUID-like identifier for your Azure subscription (not the subscription name). You can copy this from the Azure portal. |
| Subscription Name | Required. The name of your Microsoft Azure subscription (account). |
| User name | Required for Credentials authentication. User name of a work or school account (for example @fabrikam.com). Microsoft accounts (for example @live or @hotmail) are not supported. |
| Password | Required for Credentials authentication. Password for the user specified above. |
| Management Certificate | Required for Certificate based authentication. Copy the value of the management certificate key from your [publish settings XML file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=312990) or the Azure portal. |

> If your subscription is defined in an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md), ensure your application meets the relevant compliance requirements before you configure a service connection.

<h3 id="sep-azure-rm">Azure Resource Manager service connection</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Service Principal Authentication (SPA) or an Azure Managed Service Identity.
The dialog offers two main modes:

* **Automated subscription detection**. In this mode, Azure Pipelines and TFS will attempt to query Azure for all of the subscriptions and instances to which you have access using the credentials you are currently logged on with in Azure Pipelines or TFS (including Microsoft accounts and School or Work accounts).
  If no subscriptions are shown, or subscriptions other than the one you want to use, you must sign out of Azure Pipelines or TFS and sign in again
  using the appropriate account credentials.

* **Manual subscription pipeline**. In this mode, you must specify the service principal you want to use to connect to Azure. The service principal specifies the resources and the access levels that will be available over the connection.
  Use this approach when you need to connect to an Azure account using different credentials from those you are currently logged on with in Azure Pipelines or TFS.
  This is also a useful way to maximize security and limit access.

For more information, see [Connect to Microsoft Azure](connect-to-azure.md)

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see any Azure subscriptions or instances, or you have problems validating the connection, see [Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service connections](../release/azure-rm-endpoint.md).

## Extensions for other service connections

Other service connection types and tasks can be installed in Azure Pipelines
and Team Foundation Server as extensions. Some examples of service connections currently
available through extensions are:

* [TFS artifacts for Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.vss-services-externaltfs).
  Deploy on-premises TFS builds with Azure Pipelines
  through a TFS service connection
  connection and the **Team Build (external)** artifact,
  even when the TFS machine is not reachable directly
  from Azure Pipelines. For more information, see
  [External TFS](../release/artifacts.md#onpremtfssource) and
  [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/04/05/deploy-artifacts-from-onprem-tfs-server-with-release-management-service/).

* [TeamCity artifacts for Azure Pipelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vss-services-teamcity).
  This extension provides integration with TeamCity through a TeamCity service connection,
  enabling artifacts produced in TeamCity to be deployed
  by using Azure Pipelines. See
  [TeamCity](../release/artifacts.md#teamcitysource)
  for more details.

* [SCVMM Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.scvmmapp).
  Connect to a System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) server to easily
  provision virtual machines and perform actions on
  them such as managing checkpoints, starting and
  stopping VMs, and running PowerShell scripts.

* [VMware Resource Deployment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.vmwareapp).
  Connect to a VMware vCenter Server from Visual Studio Team
  Services or Team Foundation Server to provision,
  start, stop, or snapshot VMware virtual machines.

> You can also create your own [custom service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md).
