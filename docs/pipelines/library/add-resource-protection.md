# Add an admin role to a protected resource

Azure Pipelines requires specific permissions to a [protected resource](../process/about-resources.md) and to open access to all pipelines. For all protected resource types other than Environments, you'll need the administrator role to create a protected resource or edit its **Security** configuration. For Environments, you'll need the **Creator** role. When you don't appropriate access, the **Grant access permission to all pipelines** option is disabled.

Protected resources include:

* Agent pools
* Secret variables in variable groups
* Secure files
* Service connections
* Environments
* Repositories

For repository resources, see [protect a repository resource](../process/repository-resource.md). 


## Prerequisites

You must be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md) to update resource permissions.
