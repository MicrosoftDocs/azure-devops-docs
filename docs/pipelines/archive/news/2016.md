[Hosted agents](../../agents/hosted.md)

## November 29

### Build and deploy Docker apps to Azure more easily

We're doing a few things to make continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of Docker apps simpler. Last week we released Visual Studio 2017 RC to enable you to quickly and automatically create a CI/CD pipeline for ASP.NET Core projects with Docker [see below for details](#november-16).

This week we've updated the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.docker) with support for Azure Container Service and Azure Container Registry. We've also begun offering the hosted Linux pool.

### Preview: Hosted Linux pool

We're offering a preview of our new hosted Linux pool to enable you to build and release on Linux machines without having to configure a private agent.

The agents in the hosted Linux pool run on an Ubuntu Linux host inside the [vsts-agent-docker container](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-agent-docker). This container includes all the standard Java, Node, Docker and .NET Core tooling. When we start the container we map in the Docker socket from the host VM and the working folder from /opt/vsts/work. This enables you to create or spawn other Docker containers as part of your build or release pipeline using either a script or the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.docker) in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

To use the Hosted Linux pool in your build definition, go to the **General** tab, open the **Default agent queue** menu, and then select **Hosted Linux**.

If you don't see the option yet, just give it a little time. We're rolling this option out to accounts over the next few weeks.

### Definitions can be pinned to a specific task version

By popular request, we're giving you control over the major version of a task that you run in your build or release. We expect this change to result in fewer unpredictable errors that were caused by automatic updates to the agent and task version. You now specify the major version of the task on the **Build** tab of your definition.

When a minor version is released (for example, 1.2 to 1.3), you get that change automatically in your build. But if a new major version is released (for example 2.0), then your build stays locked to version 1.3 until you edit the definition and manually change to the new major version. A flag in the build definition alerts you to new major versions.

If you select a version named something such as **1.* (preview)**, keep in mind that this version is still under development and might have known problems.

> **Tip:** In a build definition you've got a few options to test a new major version of a task:
 * If you change the version and have problems, you can revert the change from the history tab.
 * Clone the build definition and test the cloned definition with the new major task version.

### Roll back changes to a build definition

You can now select a version in the build definition [history](../../build/history.md) and **Rollback** to that version.

## November 16

### Build and deploy ASP.NET apps to Azure

Today we're [announcing the Visual Studio 2017 release candidate](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/11/16/visual-studio-2017-rc/). You can use this version of Visual Studio to automatically set up a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your ASP.NET Core Web App with Docker to Azure.

![visual-studio-configure-continuous-delivery-dialog-box](_img/2016/11/visual-studio-configure-continuous-delivery-command.png)

![visual-studio-configure-continuous-delivery-dialog-box](_img/2016/11/visual-studio-configure-continuous-delivery-dialog-box.png)

[Deploy ASP.NET Core Web App with Docker to Azure](../apps/aspnet/aspnetcore-docker-to-azure.md) so that you're set up to run an automated build and deployment to Azure Container Service with every Git push.

Also, we've updated these topics with more-end-to-end details:

* [Deploy ASP.NET 4 to Azure](../../apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-4.md)

* Deploy ASP.NET Core to Azure

### Pricing changes on Azure Pipelines

Later this month, on Azure Pipelines we're moving to a pricing model based on concurrent pipelines. (Previously you paid for agents.)

**No charge for private agents:** [Private agents](../../../pipelines/agents/agents.md) are now free. In Azure Pipelines, you used to have to license each private agent after the first. Now you can run deployments concurrently for no additional charge.

**Concurrent pipelines:** For each build that you want to run concurrently on Azure Pipelines, you need a concurrent pipeline. Some concurrent pipelines are included. If you need more, you can add more in a few ways.

> **On TFS** you don't need concurrent pipelines to run builds. You can run as many builds as you want at the same time for no additional charge.

[Concurrent pipelines for your builds and releases in Azure Pipelines](../../../pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs-vsts.md)

## November 10

### Don't sync sources

To bypass synchronizing source files, select one of the Git options as your [repository type](../../build/repository.md), and then select **Don't sync sources.** This can be useful if you want to handle Git version control operations yourself, or if you just want to run automation without version control dependencies.

## October 12

### Git LFS and shallow fetch

**Checkout files from LFS:** Download files from large file storage (LFS).

**Shallow fetch:** If your repository is large, this option might make your build pipeline more efficient.

> Your agent must be version 2.107.* or newer for this feature to work.

[Specify the repository](../../build/repository.md)

### New places to search

You can now search for builds in the **Mine** and **Queued** tabs.

### Visual Studio 15 Preview 5

Build apps developed in Visual Studio 15 Preview 5:

* [Build: Visual Studio Build task](../../tasks/build/visual-studio-build.md): For **Visual Studio Version** select _Visual Studio "15" (preview)_.

* [Build: MSBuild task](../../tasks/build/msbuild.md): For **MSBuild Version** select _MSBuild 15.0 (preview)_.

> At the moment you must [deploy your own Windows agent](../../agents/v2-windows.md) to build these apps. Visual Studio 15 Preview is not yet available on the hosted pool.

### New mobile app options, updated docs

[Build your Xamarin app](../../languages/xamarin.md)

[Build and Test Xcode Projects](../../languages/xcode.md)

[Build: Xcode](../../tasks/build/xcode.md) Added Xcode 8 automatic signing. Added options to support creating app packages.

### Updated hosted build pool

[Hosted agent software list](../../agents/hosted.md#software) added:

* Azure SDK 2.9.1
* WIX 3.10
* SQL lite for Windows Phone 8.1
* Xamarin Stable Cycle 8 SR 0
* Windows 10 SDK 14393
* .NET 4.6.2
* Git 2.10.1

## September 21

### Xcode task xcpretty formatting

We've added an option that enables you to use [xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty/blob/master/README.md) to format your xcodebuild output and publish JUnit test results. See [Xcode](../../tasks/build/xcode.md).

### Publish Jenkins test and code coverage results

You can now use the **Jenkins Queue Job** build and release task to retrieve test and code coverage results from a Jenkins job or pipeline. See [Jenkins Queue Job](../../tasks/build/jenkins-queue-job.md).

### Build summary for Maven and Gradle tasks

When you enable the **Run SonarQube Analysis** option in the [Maven](../../tasks/build/maven.md) or [Gradle](../../tasks/build/gradle.md) build tasks, you get a link on the SonarQube project. You can request a full analysis to see the quality gates details, and choose to break the build if they are not met.

![maven and gradle](_img/2016/09/9_21_06.png)

### FindBugs and CheckStyle in Maven build

You can now request FindBugs and CheckStyle standalone static analysis in the [Maven](../../tasks/build/maven.md) build task (in addition to the PMD analysis). The results of the static analysis appear in the build summary, and resulting files are available from the Artifact tab of the build result.

### New and updated content

[Administer permissions](../../policies/permissions.md) Added walkthrough with examples to grant permissions.

[Triggers](../../build/triggers.md#ci) Added some tips on filtering the file path for your CI trigger.

## September 2

### Queued tab redesigned

We've implemented a new design to more cleanly show a longer list of queued and running builds.

![Queued tab](_img/2016/09/definitions-queued.png)

### Hosted pool agents are migrating to the v2 agent

We're switching from the [Windows v1 agent](../../agents/v1-windows.md) to the [Windows v2 agent](../../agents/v2-windows.md).

We expect this migration to be a non-event for the vast majority of users. However, we have seen a few cases where custom build tasks are not compatible due to reflection across internal APIs or reliance to specific agent folder layout. If you run into any issues [please let us know](../../../user-guide/provide-feedback.md).

### Xamarin builds simplified

You no longer need a Xamarin license to [build your Xamarin app](../../apps/mobile/xamarin.md). We're deprecating the [Utility: Xamarin license](../../tasks/utility/xamarin-license.md) task. We recommend that you remove this task from your build to avoid disruption when we remove the task from the product.

## August 19

We've had lots of exciting news this week. We're capping it off with a brand new user experience.

### New definitions experience

Welcome to the new definitions UX! The experience focuses on the builds you own and care about. We hope you enjoy the richer and more personalized views into the status and quality of your code.

### These builds are mine

Here you'll find the builds you care about most. The **Mine** tab features your favorites, team favorites, and builds of code that you've checked in.

![Definitions, Mine](_img/2016/08/definitions-mine.png)

The 7-day pass rate shows the percentage of builds that succeeded or partially succeeded out of all the builds completed during the past week. The arrow tells you if today's builds are doing better or worse than the 7-day rate.

### What's happening right now?

When you want to see what's happening right now and in recent history, check out the **Queued** tab.

![Definitions, Queued](_img/2016/08/definitions-queued.png)

### Folders!

Does your team have a lot of build definitions. You can now use folders to keep them organized in the **All Definitions** tab.

![Definitions, All](_img/2016/08/definitions-all.png)

![Manage folders](_img/2016/08/manage-folders.png)

> **Tip:** Have a batch of definitions that need the same permissions? Put them in a folder and then you can give permissions to the folder.
 ![Manage folders](_img/2016/08/folder-permissions.png)

### Lots more data about the build

When you click down to focus on a specific build, we now give you a lot more information about what's happening and overall code quality.

![Definition summary](_img/2016/08/definition-summary.png)
