> [!NOTE]
> This topic is archived. For the latest news on Build and Release, see the [News about Azure Pipelines](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/updates/).

## December 19

#### New documentation

Added:

* [Build: Grunt](../../tasks/build/grunt.md)

Updated:

## December 15

#### Build Universal apps

You can [build Universal apps](../../apps/windows/universal.md).

#### Why hasn't my build started? What are my build agents doing?

You can see information about what's delaying your build from starting.

![build agent pools tab with status information](_img/2015/12/build-agent-pools-tab-with-status-information.png)

#### More efficient repo cleaning

On the **Repository** tab of the build definition, when you set **Clean** to true, the cleaning is now done this way:

 * Git: git clean -fdx, git reset -hard HEAD

 * TFVC: undo pending changes and scorch.

If you want this switch to work differently, then on the Variables tab, set the ```Build.Clean``` variable to:

* ```all``` if you want to delete Agent.BuildDirectory, which is the entire working folder that contains the sources folder, binaries folder, artifact folder, and so on.

* ```source``` if you want to delete Build.SourcesDirectory.

* ```binary``` If you want to delete Build.BinariesDirectory.

#### Access the OAuth token from your script

Scripts can now use the build pipeline OAuth token to access the Azure Pipelines REST API. See [Use a script to customize your build pipeline](../../scripts/powershell.md).
