# Define a continuous integration build for your Node.js app

**[VSTS](quick-to-azure.md) | TFS 2017 RTM**

Here we'll show you how to define a continuous integration (CI) build process for your Node.js app. If you want to also continuously deploy (CD) your app to Azure, you'll be set up to make that happen after you're done creating this CI build process.

## Upload your code

0. [Download our Node.js Hello World sample app](http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/C/4/5C4CB575-D022-4BB8-9E95-5A2958C83CD2/nodejs-express-hello-world-app.zip).

0. Do you have your own code?

 * No: Upload the sample app to Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or your on-premises Team Foundation Server. Either push your code to Git or check in your code to TFVC.

 * Yes:

    0. Copy the **gulpfile.js** and **web.config** files from the sample app to the root folder of your app.

## Define your CI build

<ol>
[!INCLUDE [include](../../../_shared/begin-create-build-definition.md)]

<li>Click Empty to start with an empty definition.</li>
</ol>

### Add the build tasks

On the **Tasks** or **Build** tab, add these tasks.

<table>
   <tr>

      <td>![Package: npm install](../../../tasks/package/_img/npm.png)<br/>**Package: npm install**</td>
      <td>
<p>Install your npm package dependencies.</p>
<ul>
 <li> Command: ```install```</li>
</ul>
      </td>
</tr>

        <tr>
            <td>![Build: Gulp](../../../tasks/build/_img/gulp.png)<br/>**Build: Gulp**</td>
            <td>
<p>Pack your files into a .zip file.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gulp File Path: ```gulpfile.js```</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced, Arguments: ```--packageName=$(Build.BuildId).zip --packagePath=$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)```
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you've got a copy of **gulpfile.js** from our [sample app](#code) in the root folder of your app.</p>

</td>
        </tr>

<tr>
            <td>![Package: npm test](../../../tasks/package/_img/npm.png)<br/>**Package: npm test**</td>
            <td>
<p>(Optional) Test your application.</p>
<ul>
 <li> Command: ```test```</li>
 <li> Set the working folder to the folder where your application code is committed in the repository.</li>
</ul>
</td>
        </tr>
<tr>
            <td>![Build: Publish Build Artifacts](../../../tasks/build/_img/publish-build-artifacts.png)<br/>**Build: Publish Build Artifacts**</td>
            <td>
<p>(Optional) Drop some of the build outputs, such as the .zip file as we do in the example below.</p>
<ul>
 <li> Copy Root: ```$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)```</li>
 <li> Contents: ```$(Build.BuildId).zip```</li>
 <li> Artifact name: ```drop```</li>
 <li> Artifact Type: ```Server```</li>
</ul>
</td>
        </tr></table>

### Enable continuous integration (CI)

On the **Triggers** tab, enable **Continuous integration** (CI). This tells the system to queue a build whenever someone on your team commits or checks in new code.

### Save, queue, and test the build

Save and queue the build. Once the build is done, click the link to the completed build (for example, _Build 1634_), click **Artifacts**, and then click **Explore** to see the .zip file produced by the build. This is the web deploy package that your release definition will consume to deploy your app.

## Continuously deploy (CD) your app

After you've run the CI build, you're ready to create a continuous deployment (CD) release definition so that you can deploy your app to:

* [![Azure Web App Deploy](../../../tasks/deploy/_img/azure-web-app-deployment-icon.png) An Azure web site ](../../../apps/cd/deploy-webdeploy-webapps.md)

* [![IIS Web App Deploy](../../../tasks/deploy/_img/iis-web-application-deployment-icon.png) An IIS server](../../../apps/cd/deploy-webdeploy-iis-deploygroups.md)

* [![Build Machine Image](../../../tasks/deploy/_img/build-machine-image.png) An Azure Scale Set](../../../apps/cd/azure/deploy-azure-scaleset.md)

<h3 id="code">What code is in the sample app?</h3>

[Our Node.js Hello World sample app](http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/C/4/5C4CB575-D022-4BB8-9E95-5A2958C83CD2/nodejs-express-hello-world-app.zip) contains:

```
|-- .gitignore
`-- helloworld
    |-- gulpfile.js
    |-- package.json
    |-- server.js
    |-- web.config
    `-- typings
```

The gulpfile.js script zips up the app so it can be deployed to Azure. The web.config file enables running the app on Azure. The .gitignore file keeps build artifacts on your dev machine from getting into your Git repo.
