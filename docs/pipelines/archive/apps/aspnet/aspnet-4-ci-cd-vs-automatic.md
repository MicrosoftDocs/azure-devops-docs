# Use Visual Studio to automatically generate a CI/CD pipeline to deploy your ASP.NET web app to Azure

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2015-rtm](../../../_shared/version-tfs-2015-rtm.md)]

In this walkthrough we'll show how to use Visual Studio to automatically define a continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline to deploy an ASP.NET web application project to [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

[!INCLUDE [include](../../../apps/aspnet/_shared/ci-cd-description.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you don't yet have an app but want to try this out, then see the [Q&A below](#new_solution).

## Install the Continuous Delivery Tools extension

The quickest way to create a continuous delivery pipeline is with the Continuous Delivery Tools for Visual Studio (2017 RC.3 and newer),
which automate the creation of build and release definitions. The tools assume that you have an existing Azure Pipelines subscription,
and that your project has been added to source control.

To install the extension within Visual Studio, select **Tools > Extensions and Updates...** and search for **Continuous Delivery Tools for Visual Studio**. Alternatively, you can download the installer from the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://aka.ms/CD4VS).

## Create the build and release definitions automatically

To create both the build (CI) and release (CD) pipelines for a project, in Visual Studio, right-click the Solution node in Solution Explorer and select **Configure Continuous Delivery....** In the dialog that appears, choose the appropriate repository branch, Azure subscription, and target App Service, and click OK. You'll see details in the Output pane during the process.

## Q&A

<h3 id="new_solution">How do I create an ASP.NET 4 web app?</h3>

1. In Visual Studio, [connect to your project](../../../../organizations/projects/connect-to-projects.md#visual-studio).

1. On the Team Explorer home page (Keyboard: Ctrl + 0, H), under **Solutions**, click **New**.

1. Select the **Web** category under **Visual C#**.

1. Select **ASP.NET Web Application** and click **OK**.

1. Select **MVC** from the template list.

1. Click **Change Authentication**, select **No Authentication**, and click **OK**.

1. Optionally, set **Add unit tests** to create a unit test project for the application. Unit tests can be run automatically with every build as part of a release pipeline.

1. Clear **Host in the cloud** and click **OK**.

1. [Commit and push (Git)](../../../../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-vs.md) or [check in (TFVC)](../../../../repos/tfvc/share-your-code-in-tfvc-vs.md) your code.

### I got a file not found error message. How do I fix it?

All solution files must be checked into the server to run a build. One known cause of missing files is in cases where you populate an empty repo by creating a new project in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3. We recommend that you update your [.gitignore file](../../../../repos/git/ignore-files.md) with the latest copy from [GitHub: VisualStudio.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore).
