Click the **Triggers** tab in the build pipeline. Enable the **Continuous Integration** trigger. This will ensure that the build pipeline is automatically triggered every time you commit a change to your repository.

Select **Save & queue** to kick off your first build. On the **Save build pipeline and queue** dialog, select **Save & queue**.

A new build is started. You'll see a link to the new build on the top of the page. Click the link to watch the new build as it happens. Wait for the build to complete and succeed before proceeding to the next section.
