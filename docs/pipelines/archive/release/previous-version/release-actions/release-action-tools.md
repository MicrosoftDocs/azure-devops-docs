# Release Management tools to deploy an app

[!INCLUDE [previous-version-header](../../_shared/previous-version-header.md)]

Each release action uses a release management tool. For example, Command Line Runner is a tool that runs a specific executable for an action. If you need to perform a task that the provided tools do not support, you can create your own custom tool and add that to a custom release action. Tools can also be used to deploy a component of your app.

The following sections describe the tools provided with Release Management:

* [Database Deployment Agent - Execute Script](#database_da)
* [Reporting Services Deployment Agent](#rs_da)
* [MSI Deployment Agent](#msi_da)
* [XCopy Deployment Agent](#xcopy_da)
* [Command Line Runner](#clr)
* [Windows Registry Manager](#wrm)
* [Windows Common IO](#wcio)
* [Windows Service Manager](#wsm)
* [DACPAC Database Deployment Agent](#dacpac_da)
* [IIS Deployment Agent](#iis_da)
* [Microsoft Azure VM Manager](#mavmm)
* [XBAP Deployer](#xbapd)
* [Microsoft Test Manager Command-Line Utility](#mtm_clu)
* [INI File Manager](#ini_fm)
* [Windows Process](#wproc)

In Microsoft Test Manager 2010, this parameter is required. In Microsoft Test Manager 2012 and 2013 this parameter is still supported, but you should preferably use BuildDefinition and BuildNumber parameters.                                                  |
|    -BuildDefinition     |                 |     No\*      |       Allows the user to specify the build definition in which the automated tests are included.

|      -BuildNumber       |                 |     No\*      | Allows the user to specify the build number whose drop location will contain the automated tests. This parameter can only be used under Microsoft Test Manager 2012. If defined, the BuildDefinition parameter must also be specified. If not specified, the field "build" visible in the details of a test run, will not be affected by the test run. |

This is required to allow the test run to complete before processing the test results. If not specified, it will default to 10 seconds.                                                           |

By default, an inconclusive test will not fail the deployment.                                                                                                   |

This means that any tests that have a status different than Active will not be included in the test run.                                                                        |

If the automated tests are included in the same build pipeline as the 
application being deployed, it is possible to use metadata as the variable 
value and it will be automatically replaced at release time. The following is 
the currently available metadata that can be used with configuration 
variables:

| **Variable** | **Variable Value Metadata** |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| BuildDirectory | $(PackageLocation) |
| BuildNumber | $(BuildNumber) |
| BuildDefinition | $(BuildDefinition) |
| TFSCollection | $(TFSUrlWithCollection) |
