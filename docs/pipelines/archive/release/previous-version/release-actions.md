# Release actions to deploy an app

[!INCLUDE [previous-version-header](../_shared/previous-version-header.md)]

You add release actions to define the deployment sequence for each stage 
of your release. Each action uses a specific tool to run a command with 
a set of arguments.

If you haven't created your release path yet, go 
**[here](manage-your-release.md)** to do that.

Drag a release action from the toolbox to add it to your deployment 
sequence. Use any of the predefined release actions listed in the 
toolbox, or create your own **[custom release actions](#custom)**.

![Configure Apps tab, Release Templates tab ](_img/release-actions-01.png)

After adding a release action to the sequence, you can edit the 
configuration variables as necessary. For details about predefined 
release actions and their configuration variables go 
**[here](#actions_variables)**. Find out about the tools used by release 
actions **[here](release-actions/release-action-tools.md)**.

## Add a custom release action
 
Add a new release action and choose the tool that you want this action 
to use. Or, you can copy an existing action and use that as a basis to 
create a custom release action. You can't edit an existing release action.

1. From the Release Management client, open the **Inventory** page.
   (If the page doesn't appear, then request the **Can Manage Inventory**
   permission.)

1. Copy the action you want to edit, or add a new action.

   ![Copy a release action](_img/release-actions-02.png)

1. Select the tool that you want to use based on your requirements for 
   the action. Choose **New** to add your own custom tool if the 
   **[predefined tools](release-actions/release-action-tools.md)** 
   cannot do what you need for that step in your deployment sequence.

1. In the **Execution section**, enter any required arguments with 
   their tokens in the necessary format. You must add the prefix and 
   suffix consisting of two underscores (**\_\_**) to each parameter.
   Whenever you delete or add arguments with their tokens, they appear 
   in the **Parameters** list. For example, add the following arguments 
   with tokens:

   `-servername __servername__ -switch __onoff__` 

   Now **servername** and **onoff** are displayed in the list of parameters.

### To deactivate a release action

If there are some actions that you don't want your team to use, deactivate 
them. Open the action from the **Inventory** page and choose the 
**Deactivate** button.

### To reactivate a release action

Open the **Inactive** list, open the action, and choose **Activate**.

![Inactive list on Inventory page](_img/release-actions-03.png)

## Q & A

### Q: What permissions do I need to edit release actions?

**A**:To edit or add release actions, users must have the **Can Manage 
Inventory** permission. If the permission is not enabled, the **Inventory**
page does not display.

When the **No Tool** option is selected, the **Command** and **Arguments**
fields are not editable unless you have the **Can Use Custom Tool in Actions
and Components** permission. In **Configure Apps**, **Components**, when a 
user does not have the **Can Use Custom Tool in Actions and Components**
permission, the **Command** and **Arguments** fields will not be editable 
when the option **No Tool** is selected.

## Actions and Configuration Variables for Release Actions

* [Manage application pools and websites](#iis)
* [Create or modify .ini files](#ini)
* [Manage SQL Server databases](#sql)
* [Set up your servers](#winos)
* [Manage Windows services](#winsvc)
 
<a name="iis"></a>
### Manage application pools and websites
 
These actions use the predefined **IIS Deployer** tool to manage application 
pools, websites, web applications, and virtual directories. These actions 
are supported under IIS 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5. For details about this tool, 
go **[here](release-actions/release-action-tools.md)**.

| **Action** | **Usage and deployment failure conditions** |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Create Application Pool, Configure Application Pool, Recycle Application Pool, Remove Application Pool, Start Application Pool, Stop Application Pool | **Create Application Pool**: this action creates a new application pool under IIS. For IIS 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5 If the application pool already exists, it will be reconfigured to match the defined configuration variable values (undefined configuration variables will not affect the actual configuration of the application pool).  Under IIS versions prior to 7.0, if the application pool already exists, the deployment will fail.  **Configure Application Pool**, **Recycle Application Pool**, **Start Application Pool**, or **Stop Application Pool**: these actions will reconfigure, recycle, start, or stop an application pool. The deployment fails if the application pool doesn't exist. |
| Create Web Site, Configure Web Site, Remove Web Site, Start Web Site, Stop Web Site | **Create Web Site**: creates a new website under IIS. For IIS 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5. If the website already exists, it will be reconfigured to match the defined configuration variable values (undefined configuration variables will not affect the actual configuration of the website).  Under IIS versions prior to 7.0, if the application pool already exists, the deployment will fail.  **Configure Web Site**, **Restart Web Site**, **Start Web Site**, **Stop Web Site**: these actions will reconfigure, restart, start, or stop a website. The deployment fails if the website doesn't exist. |
| Create Web Application, Configure Web Application, Remove Web Application | **Create Web Application**: creates a new Web application under IIS. For IIS 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5. If the Web application already exists, it will be reconfigured to match the defined configuration variable values (undefined configuration variables will not affect the actual configuration of the Web application).  Under IIS versions prior to 7.0, if the application pool already exists, the deployment will fail.  **Configure Web Application** will reconfigure a Web application. The deployment fails if the Web application doesn't exist. |
| Create Virtual Directory, Configure Virtual Directory, Remove Virtual Directory | **Create Virtual Directory**: creates a virtual directory under IIS. For IIS 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5. If the virtual directory already exists, it will be reconfigured to match the defined configuration variable values (undefined configuration variables will not affect the actual configuration of the virtual directory).  **Configure Virtual Directory** will reconfigure a virtual directory. The deployment fails if the virtual directory doesn't exist. |

as manage files, folders, environment variables, and Windows registry keys 
and values. The system executes these actions using several predefined 
Release Management tools, including **Command Line Runner**, **Windows Process**, 
and **XCOPY Deployer**. For details about these tools, go
**[here](release-actions/release-action-tools.md)**.
