# Automate deployments with Release Management

[!INCLUDE [previous-version-header](../_shared/previous-version-header.md)]

Support a rapid release cadence and manage simultaneous releases. Set up 
release paths that represent your stages from development to production.
Run actions to deploy your app to an environment for that stage. Add 
approvers to sign off that the app has successfully passed each stage.
Start your release pipeline manually or automatically from a build. Then track your 
releases as they move through your release path.

![Overview of Release Management](_img/overview-01.png)

**Set up and start a release** 

* [Set up the release management server, client, and deployment agents](install-release-management.md).
* [Set up users and groups and control access to Release Management](add-users-and-groups.md).
* [Create your release path and start a release](manage-your-release.md).

After you have created your release path, you can 
[trigger a release from a build](trigger-a-release.md).

You can also simplify your scripts using 
[configuration variables and system variables](config-and-system-variables.md).
