# Release Management for Visual Studio, Azure Pipelines, and Team Foundation Server

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2015 | VS 2013**  

**Release Management** helps you support a rapid release cadence and manage simultaneous releases.
You can:

* Set up release pipelines that represent your environments from development to production.
* Run automations to deploy your app to each environment.
* Add approvers to sign off that the app has been successfully deployed in an environment.
* Create your release manually or automatically from a build.
* Track your releases as they are deployed to various environments.

... and much more.

The **[current version](../../overview.md)** of Release Management is integrated into **Azure Pipelines** and
Team Foundation Server (TFS).
For more information, see **[Build and Release in Azure Pipelines and TFS](../../overview.md)**.

The **previous versions** of Release Management are deprecated. No new features will be added to these versions:

* **[Server and client version for Visual Studio 2015](overview-rm2015.md)**
* **[Server and client version for Visual Studio 2013](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn217874%28v%3Dvs.120%29.aspx)**
