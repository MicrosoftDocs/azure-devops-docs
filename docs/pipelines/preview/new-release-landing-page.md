# New release landing page

A new and fully redesigned user experience is available for release landing page in VSTS.
To use this page, you simply need to switch it on using one of the on-screen prompts,
or from the [user profile **Previews** panel](../../collaborate/preview-features.md#enable-features-for-your-use).

## Highlights

* [See a list of the release definitions you release often](#listdefs)
* [Search for your definitions and favorite them](#favorite) 
* [Get great artifact traceability - see only the most relevant releases for a definition currently deployed to an environment](#filter) 
* [View the pipeline easily by expanding a release](#pipeline)
* [Create folders for organization and security](#folders)
* [Set permissions at a folder level](#folders)

## Active tab

<a name="listdefs"></a>
The **Active** tab shows a list of release definitions, and contains links to create or import a definition,
edit the selected definition, and create a release. 

![](_img/releases-page/1.png)

Use the drop-down menu to create a draft release, or to delete, clone, or export the selected release definition. 

![](_img/releases-page/2.png)

<a name="favorite"></a>
Search for definitions if you have many in your list, or make it easy to select regularly used definitions by adding them to your list of favorites...

<a name="filter"></a>
... or use the filter options to show the required subset of definitions. 

![](_img/releases-page/4.png)

<a name="pipeline"></a>
Use the drop-down menu to open a release and see the pipeline, abandon an executing release, delete a release, or to retain a release indefinitely.

![](_img/releases-page/5.png)

##All definitions tab

<a name="folders"></a>
The **All definitions** tab shows all your release definitions as a folder tree.
Create folders and set permissions at folder level.
Use the drop-down menu to create a release or work with the selected definition.

Because this is currently a preview, expect to see changes to the features and layout as development of the page continues.
