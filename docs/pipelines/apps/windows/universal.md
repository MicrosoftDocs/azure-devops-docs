# Build your Universal Windows Platform app

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.2**

Universal Windows Platform (UWP) is a common app platform available on every device that runs Windows 10. Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide a highly customizable continuous integration (CI) process to automatically build and package your UWP app whenever your team pushes or checks in code. In this quickstart you learn how to define your CI process.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-cd-prerequisites-vsts.md)]

* While the simplest way to try this quickstart is to use a VSTS account, you can also use a TFS server instead of a VSTS account. Make sure that you have [configured a build agent](../../agents/v2-windows.md) for your team project, and that you have a version of Visual Studio matching your development machine installed on the agent machine.

## Get sample app code

[!INCLUDE [include](../_shared/get-sample-code-intro.md)]

```
https://github.com/Microsoft/UWPQuickStart
```

# [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/vsts)

[!INCLUDE [include](../_shared/get-sample-code-vsts-tfs-2017-update-2.md)]

# [GitHub repo](#tab/github)

[!INCLUDE [include](../_shared/get-sample-code-github.md)]

---

## Set up continuous integration

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-quickstart-intro.md)]

[//]: # (TODO: Restore use of includes when we get support for using them in a list.)

1. Create a new build definition.

 # [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/vsts)

 Navigate to the **Files** tab of the **Code** hub, and then click **Set up build**.

 ![Screenshot showing button to set up build for a repository](../_shared/_img/set-up-first-build-from-code-hub.png)

 You are taken to the **Build and Release** hub and asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

 # [GitHub repo](#tab/github)

 Navigate to the **Builds** tab of the **Build and Release** hub in VSTS or TFS, and then click **+ New**. You are asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

 ---

1. In the right panel, click **Universal Windows Platform**, and then click **Apply**.

 You now see all the tasks that were automatically added to the build definition by the template. These are the tasks that will automatically run every time you push code changes.

1. For the **Agent queue**:

 * **VSTS:** Select _Hosted VS2017_. This is how you can use our pool of agents that have the software you need to build your app.

 * **TFS:** Select a queue that includes a [Windows build agent](../../agents/v2-windows.md).

1. Click **Get sources** and then:

 # [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/vsts)

 Observe that the new build definition is automatically linked to your repository.

 # [GitHub repo](#tab/github)

 Select your version control repository. You'll need to authorize access to your repo.

 ---

1. Click the **Triggers** tab in the build definition. Enable the **Continuous Integration** trigger. This will ensure that the build process is automatically triggered every time you commit a change to your repository.

1. Click **Save & queue** to kick off your first build. On the **Save build definition and queue** dialog box, click **Save & queue**.

1. A new build is started. You'll see a link to the new build on the top of the page. Click the link to watch the new build as it happens.

## Next steps

You can now update the build definition to generate production builds.
