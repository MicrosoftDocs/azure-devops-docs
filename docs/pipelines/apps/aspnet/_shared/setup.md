## Get set up

### Azure DevOps organization

You'll need an organization in Azure DevOps. To create one, visit [Sign up for Azure DevOps](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vsts/).

You can also use Team Foundation Server (TFS) if you require the use of on-premises servers instead of Azure DevOps, and we'll show some of those details. Also see [Get Started with TFS](/azure/devops/server/install/get-started) for general information.

### Set up local version control and a project

Creating a release pipeline relies on having your application code in version control. To set up a local repository and connect it to a remote repository in a project, follow the instructions in either [Share your code with Git and Visual Studio](../../../../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-vs.md) or [Share your code with TFVC and Visual Studio](../../../../repos/tfvc/share-your-code-in-tfvc-vs.md).
