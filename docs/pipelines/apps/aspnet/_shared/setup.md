## Get set up

### VSTS account

You'll need an account on VSTS. To create one, visit [Sign up for VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/vsts/).

You can also use Team Foundation Server (TFS) if your organization requires the use of on-premises servers instead of VSTS, and we'll show some of those details. Also see [Get Started with TFS](/tfs/server/install/get-started) for general information.

### Set up local version control and a team project

Creating a release pipeline relies on having your application code in version control. To set up a local repository and connect it to a remote repository in a team project, follow the instructions in either [Share your code with Git and Visual Studio](../../../../git/share-your-code-in-git-vs.md) or [Share your code with TFVC and Visual Studio](../../../../tfvc/share-your-code-in-tfvc-vs.md).
