# Build your Azure cloud service

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version.md)]

Here we'll show you how to define your continuous integration (CI) process for your Azure cloud service project.

## Get set up

For the instructions in this topic, you need an Azure cloud service project in Visual Studio.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't yet have an app but want to try this out, then see the [Q&A below](#new_solution).

## Define your CI build process

### Create the build definition

<ol>
    [!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/begin-create-build-definition.md)]

    <li>Select the **Azure Cloud Service** template.</li>


    <li>As the repository source, select the team project, repository, and branch.</li>

    <li>Remove the **Azure Cloud Service Deployment task** from the build definition, since you will be deploying the cloud service later through a release definition.</li>
</ol>

### Enable continuous integration (CI)

On the Triggers tab, enable **continuous integration** (CI). This tells the system to queue a build whenever someone on your team commits or checks in new code.

## Queue and test the build

Save the build definition and queue a new build by selecting the **Queue new build** command. Once the build is done, click **Artifacts** and then **Explore** to see the cloud service package (.cspkg file) produced by the build. This is the package that your release definition will consume to deploy your app.

## Deploy your app

After you've run the build, you're ready to create a release definition to deploy your app to:
