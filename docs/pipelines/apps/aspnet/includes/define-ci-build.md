<h2 id="ci">Define and test your CI build pipeline</h2>

Continuous integration means starting an automated build whenever new code is committed to or checked into the project's source control repository. This gives you immediate feedback that the code builds and can potentially be deployed. You can also run automated tests. Finally, this CI build will produce a web deploy package artifact and publish it so that it can be consumed by your CD pipeline.
