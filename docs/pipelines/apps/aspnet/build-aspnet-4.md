# Build ASP.NET apps with .NET Framework

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This article describes how to build a .NET Framework project with Azure Pipelines. For .NET Core projects, see [Build, test, and deploy .NET Core apps](../../ecosystems/dotnet-core.md).

## Create an Azure DevOps project

1. In your Azure DevOps organization or collection, select **New project** or **Create project**.
1. Enter a **Project name**.
1. Select the **Visibility** for your project.
1. Select **Create**.

## Get the sample app

The sample app is a Visual Studio solution that uses .NET 4.8. To get the app, fork the GitHub repo at: 

``` html
https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-web-dotnet-get-started

```

## Create and build the pipeline

Once you have the sample code in your own repository, create a pipeline in your Azure DevOps project by using the instructions in [Create your first pipeline](../../create-first-pipeline.md).

Select the **ASP.NET** template. This choice automatically adds the *azure-pipelines.yml* file with the tasks required to build the code to the sample repository. The template includes the VSTest@2 task to run tests. The sample repository doesn't contain tests, so you can remove the VSTest@2 task from the pipeline.  

Your pipeline should look like the following example:

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

```yaml
# ASP.NET
# Build and test ASP.NET projects.
# Add steps that publish symbols, save build artifacts, deploy, and more:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-4

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

variables:
  solution: '**/*.sln'
  buildPlatform: 'Any CPU'
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: NuGetToolInstaller@1

- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    restoreSolution: '$(solution)'

- task: VSBuild@1
  inputs:
    solution: '$(solution)'
    msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.artifactStagingDirectory)"'
    platform: '$(buildPlatform)'
    configuration: '$(buildConfiguration)'

```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

```yaml
# ASP.NET
# Build and test ASP.NET projects.
# Add steps that publish symbols, save build artifacts, deploy, and more:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-4

trigger:
- main

pool: 
  name: default
  
variables:
  solution: '**/*.sln'
  buildPlatform: 'Any CPU'
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

steps:
- task: NuGetToolInstaller@1

- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    restoreSolution: '$(solution)'

- task: VSBuild@1
  inputs:
    solution: '$(solution)'
    msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.artifactStagingDirectory)"'
    platform: '$(buildPlatform)'
    configuration: '$(buildConfiguration)'

```

::: moniker-end

Select **Save and run** and select **Jobs** to see the pipeline in action.

To publish the build artifacts, add the following task to the end of your YAML file:

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

```yaml
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)'
    artifact: 'myartifact'
    publishLocation: 'pipeline'
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

```yaml

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathToPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    artifactName: drop

```
::: moniker-end


## Build environment

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops"

You can use Azure Pipelines to build your .NET Framework projects without needing to set up any infrastructure of your own. The [Microsoft-hosted agents](../../agents/hosted.md) in Azure Pipelines have several released versions of Visual Studio preinstalled to help you build your projects. Use `windows-2022` for Windows Server 2022 with Visual Studio 2022.

You can also use a [self-hosted agent](../../agents/agents.md#install) to run your builds. Using a self-hosted agent is helpful if you have a large repository and you want to avoid downloading the source code to a fresh machine for every build.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

Your builds run on a [self-hosted agent](../../agents/agents.md#install). Make sure that you have the necessary version of Visual Studio installed on the agent.

::: moniker-end

## Build multiple configurations

You might need to build your app in multiple configurations. The following steps build the example app on four configurations: `Debug, x86`, `Debug, x64`, `Release, x86`, and `Release, x64`.

1. In the pipeline UI, select the **Variables** tab and modify the following variables:

   - `BuildConfiguration` = `debug, release`
   - `BuildPlatform` = `x86, x64`

1. Select **Tasks** and then select **agent job** to change the following options for the job:

   - Select **Multi-configuration**.
   - Specify **Multipliers:** `BuildConfiguration, BuildPlatform`

1. Select **Parallel** if you have multiple build agents and want to build your configuration/platform pairings in parallel.

## Restore dependencies

You can use the [NuGet task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2) to install and update NuGet package dependencies. You can also use the NuGet task to download NuGet packages from Azure Artifacts, NuGet.org, or other external or internal NuGet repositories.

The following example restores a solution from a project-scoped feed in the same organization.

```yaml
- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: 'restore'
    feedsToUse: 'select'
    vstsFeed: 'my-project/my-project-scoped-feed'
    includeNuGetOrg: false
    restoreSolution: '**/*.sln'
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Ubuntu 24.04 or higher, you must use the `NuGetAuthenticate` task with the .NET CLI instead of the `NuGetCommand@2` task. See [Support for newer Ubuntu hosted images](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/nuget-command-v2#support-for-newer-ubuntu-hosted-images) for more details.
