You've just put your own CI pipeline in place to automatically build and validate whatever code is checked in by your team. You can also automatically deploy your app. To learn more, see one of these topics:

* [Deploy to Azure Web App](../cd/deploy-webdeploy-webapps.md)
* [Deploy to a Linux VM](../cd/deploy-linuxvm-deploygroups.md)
* [Deploy to a Windows VM](../cd/deploy-webdeploy-iis-deploygroups.md)

You can also modify this build pipeline to meet the needs of your team. To learn more see one of these topics:
