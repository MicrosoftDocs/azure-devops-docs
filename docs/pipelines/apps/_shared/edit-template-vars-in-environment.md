   > **NOTE**: Some settings for the tasks may have been automatically defined as
   [environment variables](../../release/variables.md#custom-variables)
   when you created a release definition from a template.
   These settings cannot be modified in the task settings; instead you must 
   select the parent environment item in order to edit these settings.
