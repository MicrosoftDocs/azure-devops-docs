<h2 id="cd">Define your CD release pipeline</h2>

Your CD release pipeline picks up the artifacts published by your CI build and then deploys them to your Azure web site.

1. Do one of the following to start creating a release pipeline:

   * If you've just completed a CI build (see above), choose the link (for example, _Build 20170815.1_)
     to open the build summary. Then choose **Release** to start a new release pipeline that's automatically linked to the build pipeline.

   * Open the **Releases** tab in **Azure Pipelines**, open the **+** drop-down
     in the list of release pipelines, and choose **Create release pipeline**.

1. The easiest way to create a release pipeline is to use a template. If you are deploying a Node.js app, select the **Deploy Node.js App to Azure App Service** template.
   Otherwise, select the **Azure App Service Deployment** template. Then choose **Apply**.

   > The only difference between these templates is that Node.js template configures the task to generate a **web.config** file containing a parameter that starts the **iisnode** service.

1. If you created your new release pipeline from a build summary, check that the build pipeline and artifact
   is shown in the **Artifacts** section on the **Pipeline** tab. If you created a new release pipeline from
   the **Releases** tab, choose the **+ Add** link and select your build artifact.

1. Choose the **Continuous deployment** icon in the **Artifacts** section, check that the
   continuous deployment trigger is enabled, and add a filter to include the **master** branch.

   > Continuous deployment is not enabled by default when you create a new release pipeline from the **Releases** tab.

1. Open the **Tasks** tab and, with **Stage 1** selected, configure the task property variables as follows:

   * **Azure Subscription:** Select a connection from the list under **Available Azure Service Connections** or create a more restricted permissions connection to your Azure subscription.
     If you are using Azure Pipelines and if you see an **Authorize** button next to the input, click on it to authorize Azure Pipelines to connect to your Azure subscription. If you are using TFS or if you do not see
     the desired Azure subscription in the list of subscriptions, see [Azure Resource Manager service connection](../../library/connect-to-azure.md) to manually set up the connection.

   * **App Service Name**: Select the name of the web app from your subscription.

1. Save the release pipeline.

<h2 id="deploy">Create a release to deploy your app</h2>

You're now ready to create a release, which means to run the release pipeline with the artifacts produced by a specific build. This will result in deploying the build:

1. Choose **+ Release** and select **Create a release**.

1. In the **Create a new release** panel, check that the artifact version you want to use is selected and choose **Create**.

1. Choose the release link in the information bar message. For example: "Release **Release-1** has been created".

1. In the pipeline view, choose the status link in the stages of the pipeline to see the logs and agent output.

1. After the release is complete, navigate to your site running in Azure using the Web App URL `http://{web_app_name}.azurewebsites.net`, and verify its contents.
