1. Create a new build definition.

 # [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/vsts)

 Navigate to the **Files** tab of the **Code** hub, and then click **Set up build**.

 ![Screenshot showing button to set up build for a repository](../_shared/_img/set-up-first-build-from-code-hub.png)

 You are taken to the **Build and Release** hub and asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

 # [GitHub repo](#tab/github)

 Navigate to the **Builds** tab of the **Build and Release** hub in VSTS or TFS, and then click **+ New**. You are asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

1. In the right panel, click **Start with an Empty Process**.

1. For the **Agent queue**, select _Hosted Linux_. This is how you can use our pool of agents that have the software you need to build your app.

1. Click **Get sources** and then:

  # [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/vsts)

  Observe that the new build definition is automatically linked to your repository.

  # [GitHub repo](#tab/github)

  Select your version control repository. You'll need to authorize access to your repo.

1. Select **+ Add Task** to add another task to the build definition. From the displayed task catalog, select **Docker** task. Change the parameters for this task as follows:

   * **Azure subscription:** Select a connection from the list under **Available Azure Service Connections** or create a more restricted permissions connection to your Azure subscription. If you are using VSTS and if you see an **Authorize** button next to the input, click on it to authorize VSTS to connect to your Azure subscription. If you are using TFS or if you do not see
     the desired Azure subscription in the list of subscriptions, see [Azure Resource Manager service endpoint](../../library/service-endpoints.md#sep-azure-rm) to manually set up the connection.

   * **Azure Container Registry:** Select the Azure container registry that you created above.

   * **Action:** Build an image.

1. Select **+ Add Task** to add another **Docker** task to the build definition.
   Make sure that the task is inserted _after_ the previous **Docker** task. Change the parameters for this task as follows:

   * **Azure subscription:** Same as in previous task.

   * **Azure Container Registry:** Same as in previous task.

   * **Action:** Push an image.

1. Click the **Triggers** tab in the build definition. Enable the **Continuous Integration** trigger. This will ensure that the build process is automatically triggered every time you commit a change to your repository.

1. Click **Save & queue** to kick off your first build. On the **Save build definition and queue** dialog box, click **Save & queue**.

1. A new build is started. You'll see a link to the new build on the top of the page. Click the link to watch the new build as it happens.
