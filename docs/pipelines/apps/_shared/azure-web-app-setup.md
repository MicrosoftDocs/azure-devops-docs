### Create the Azure app service

An [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-value-prop-what-is/) is where you'll deploy your application. Technically speaking, an app service is a resource with a specific pricing tier in Azure that can then host multiple, distinct applications. In this example we'll use a [Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-overview/).
If you're creating a new App Service for this example, you can use the [Free pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/).

To create a new Web App, simply go to the App Services blade on the Azure portal, click **+Add**, select the **Web App** template, click **Create**, and enter a name and other details. The web app URL will then be `{name}.azurewebsites.net.`

If you have an existing Azure account, you can certainly use a new or existing App Service in that account for this walkthrough.

If you don't yet have an Azure account, you can get started for free through [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/).

<p><a data-toggle="collapse" href="#try-azure">Can I just use a temporary App Service instead? &#x25BC;</a></p>
<div class="collapse" id="try-azure">
 Yes, just visit [Create your Azure App Service App](https://tryappservice.azure.com/) to set up a Web App for temporary use (1 hour). On that page, do the following:

<ol>
<li>Select <b>Web App</b> and choose <b>Next</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>Empty Site</b> and choose <b>Create</b> (we use an empty site because you already have the necessary application code in your Visual Studio project).</li>
<li> Enter your Microsoft account credentials when requested.</li>
</ol>
In a few moments the site will then give you a URL such as `https://df8381c9-0ee0-4-aaa-aaaa.azurewebsites.net/`. This is the URL of your live site to which we'll deploy the application.
