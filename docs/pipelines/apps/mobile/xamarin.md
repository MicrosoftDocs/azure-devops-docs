# Build your Xamarin app

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.2**

Xamarin enables you to develop a single solution and deploy it to Android, iOS, and Windows devices. Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide a highly customizable continuous integration (CI) process to automatically build and package your Xamarin app whenever your team pushes or checks in code. In this quickstart you learn how to define your CI process.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-cd-prerequisites-vsts.md)]

* While the simplest way to try this quickstart is to use a VSTS account, you can also use a TFS server instead of a VSTS account.

* You will build the sample app for Android and iOS using two build definitions in this quickstart. If you use VSTS, you can use a hosted agent for both. If you use TFS, you will need a private agent to build Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS. Xamarin.iOS requires an agent running on macOS. Set up a private agent and [install Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/download) on the agent machine. The Xamarin version on your development machine and build agent machine must be at least 4.0.3 for Windows and 5.10.3 for macOS.

 |Build | [Hosted agents](../../agents/hosted.md) | [On-premises Windows agent](../../agents/v2-windows.md) | On-premises [macOS](../../agents/v2-osx.md) or [Linux](../../agents/v2-linux.md) agent |
 |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
 | Xamarin.Android | Yes | Yes (with Xamarin installed) | Yes (with Xamarin installed) |
 | Xamarin.iOS | Yes | No | Yes (with Xamarin installed) |
 | UWP | Yes | Yes (Windows 10) | No |

## Set up continuous integration

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-quickstart-intro.md)]

[//]: # (TODO: Restore use of includes when we get support for using them in a list.)

You need to create two build definitions - one for Xamarin.Android and one for Xamarin.iOS.

### Define your Xamarin.Android build

1. Create a new build definition.

 # [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/vsts)

 Navigate to the **Files** tab of the **Code** hub, and then click **Set up build**.

 ![Screenshot showing button to set up build for a repository](../_shared/_img/set-up-first-build-from-code-hub.png)

 You are taken to the **Build and Release** hub and asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

 # [GitHub repo](#tab/github)

 Navigate to the **Builds** tab of the **Build and Release** hub, and then click **+ New**. You are asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

 ---

1. In the right panel, click **Xamarin.Android**, and then click **Apply**.

 You now see all the tasks that were automatically added to the build definition by the template. These are the tasks that will automatically run every time you push code changes.

1. For the **Agent queue**:

 * **VSTS:** Select _Hosted VS2017_. This hosted pool of agents has the software needed to build your app.

 * **TFS:** Select a queue that includes a [macOS](../../agents/v2-osx.md) or [Windows](../../agents/v2-windows.md) build agent.

1. Click **Get sources** and then:

 # [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/vsts)

 Observe that the new build definition is automatically linked to your repository.

 # [GitHub repo](#tab/github)

 Select your version control repository. You'll need to authorize access to your repo.

 ---

1. Select the **Build Xamarin.Android Project** task. In the properties for this task, select `JDK 8` as the **JDK Version**, and `x64` as the **JDK Architecture**.

1. Select the **Build solution **/test*.csproj** task. In the properties for this task, uncheck **Enabled** under **Control Options**. There are no tests in the sample repository.

1. Select the **Xamarin Test Cloud** task. Remove this task from the definition by right-clicking it and selecting **Remove selected task(s)**.

1. Click **Save & queue** to kick off your first build. On the **Save build definition and queue** dialog box, click **Save & queue**.

1. A new build is started. You'll see a link to the new build on the top of the page. Click the link to watch the new build as it happens.

[//]: # (TODO:> To learn more about GitHub CI builds, see [Define CI build process for your Git repo](#)

### Define your Xamarin.iOS build

Navigate to the **Builds** tab of the **Build and Release** hub, and then click **+ New**. You are asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition. This time, select the **Xamarin.iOS** template.

1. For the **Agent queue**, select a hosted macOS queue such as **Hosted macOS**, or the private queue that includes your macOS agent.

1. For the **Solution to build**, enter `HelloXamarinFormsWorld.sln`.

1. Remove the **Xamarin Test Cloud** task by right-clicking it and selecting **Remove selected task(s)**.

1. Select the **Build Xamarin.iOS solution** task. In the properties for this task, enable the **Build for iOS Simulator** check box.

1. Click **Save & queue** to kick off the Xamarin.iOS build. On the **Save build definition and queue** dialog box, click **Save & queue**.

1. A new build is started. You will see a link to the new build on the top of the page. Click the link to watch the new build as it happens.

## Next steps

To be able to configure your own app for iOS release, you need to make the following changes in the solution in your development environment, since the Xamarin.iOS build requires a solution configuration that builds only the Xamarin.iOS project and its dependencies.

0. In Visual Studio, open **Solution Explorer** (Keyboard: Ctrl + Alt + L).

0. Right-click your solution and then click **Configuration Manager**.

0. On the configuration manager dialog box open the active solution configuration drop-down menu and click **New**.

0. On the new solution configuration dialog box:

 * For Name, enter `iOS Release`

 * Open **Copy settings from** drop-down menu and select **Release**.

 * Clear the **Create new project configurations** dialog box.

0. Open the **Active solution platform** drop-down menu:

 0. Select **iPhoneSimulator** and clear the check boxes on all rows except your Xamarin.iOS project and any projects (for example, portable class libraries) it depends on.

 0. Repeat this step for **iPhone**.

0. File -> Save All (Keyboard: Ctrl + Shift + S).

0. Check in your changes.

There's also a known issue that might cause a problem with building your Xamarin.iOS project. For example, in the build log for a Xamarin.iOS build task you might see an errors such as *error : Project reference '../App1/App1.csproj' has invalid or missing guid for metadata 'Project'*.

To fix this issue:

0. In Visual Studio, open **Solution Explorer** (Keyboard: Ctrl + Alt + L).

0. Expand your .iOS project node, and then the **References** node.

0. Right-click each reference to a portable class library and then click **Remove**.

0. Right-click the **References** node and then click **Add Reference**.

0. On the **Reference Manager** dialog box, expand **Projects**, and then click **Solution**.

0. Select the portable class library projects you removed and click **OK**.

0. File -> Save All (Keyboard: Ctrl + Shift + S).

0. Check in your changes.
