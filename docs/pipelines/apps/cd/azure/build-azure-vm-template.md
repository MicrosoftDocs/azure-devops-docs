# Build an Azure virtual machine using an Azure RM template

In just a few steps, you can provision Azure virtual machines (VMs)
using [Resource Manager (RM) templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-template-deploy/).
Managing the pipelines for virtual machines in this
way is considered **Infrastructure as code** and is
a good DevOps practice.

For this example, the template for creating the Azure
VMs must be checked into a version control repository
along with the rest of the application code, and it
must be published as part of the build output.

## Create the template 

Before you can build the solution, you must create an Azure RM template.
Follow these steps to create and check-in a new Resource Manager template.

1. In Visual Studio, choose **File | Add | New project** and add a
   new **Azure Resource Group** project to your solution.

1. When prompted for an Azure template, select **Windows Virtual Machine**.

   > The **Windows Virtual Machine** template is a simple example of
   provisioning a single virtual machine in Azure.
   For provisioning other types of resources, you can either edit the
   **WindowsVirtualMachine.json** file, select other
   templates in the project creation wizard, or download one
   of the many templates available at
   [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates).

1. Add a project for your app to the solution. This could be
   a project for an existing app, or a new project created from the
   Visual Studio **File | Add | New project** menu.

1. Save the entire solution (not just the project) and 
   commit the changes into a [Team Foundation Server](../../../../repos/tfvc/index.md) or 
   [Azure Repos Git](../../../../repos/git/index.md) repository.

## Create the build pipeline

Carry out the following steps to publish an artifact with the Resource Manager template files.

1. [Create a new build pipeline](../../../create-first-pipeline.md#create-a-build-pipeline) for the solution you just checked into a TFS or Git repo.

1. [Enable continuous integration (CI)](../../../create-first-pipeline.md#enable-continuous-integration-ci). This tells the system to queue a build whenever someone on your team commits or checks in new code.

1. [Publish the artifacts from the build](../../../create-first-pipeline.md#publish-an-artifact-from-your-build).
   Make sure that the template files from your ARM template
   project are included in the artifacts published by your build pipeline.

1. [Save the pipeline and queue a new build](../../../create-first-pipeline.md#save-and-queue-the-build).
   Verify that the artifact contains the **Templates** folder containing the template files
   **WindowsVirtualMachine.json** and **WindowsVirtualMachine.parameters.json**.
   This is the template that your release pipeline will consume to provision an Azure virtual machine.

## Provision your virtual machine

After you've run the build, you're ready to create a release pipeline to provision your virtual machine:
