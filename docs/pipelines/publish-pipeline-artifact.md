# Publish Pipeline Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Azure Artifacts enable developers to store and manage their packages and control who they want to share it with. Pipeline Artifacts are generated after you build your application. The output can then be deployed or consumed by another job in your pipeline.

## Publish Artifacts

> [!NOTE]
> Publish pipeline artifacts is not supported in release pipelines. It is only supported in build pipelines, multi-stage pipelines, and yaml pipelines.

You can publish your Artifacts at any stage of your pipeline using YAML or the classic editor. You won't be billed for storing your Pipeline Artifacts or using Pipeline caching.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

```yaml
steps:
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)'
    artifactType: 'pipeline'
    artifactName: 'drop'
```

- **targetPath**: Path to the folder or file you want to publish. (Required)
- **artifactType**: Artifacts publish location. (Required). Options: pipeline, filepath. Default value: pipeline.
- **artifactName**: Name of your Artifact. (Optional).

# [Classic](#tab/classic)

1. From your pipeline definition, select + to add a new task.

1. Search for the **Publish Pipeline Artifacts** task :::image type="icon" source="tasks/utility/media/publish-pipeline-artifact.png" border="false"::: and then select **Add** to add it to your pipeline.

1. Fill out the following fields:
    - **Display name**: the task display name.
    - **File or directory path**: the path of the file or directory to publish.
    - **Artifact name**: name of the Artifact to publish.
    - **Artifact publish location**: choose whether to store the Artifact in Azure Pipelines, or to copy it to a file share.
