Azure Pipelines, Azure DevOps Server, and TFS integrate with a number of version control systems. When you use any of these version control systems, you can configure a pipeline to build, test, and deploy your application.

YAML pipelines are a new form of pipelines that have been introduced in Azure DevOps Server 2019 and in Azure Pipelines. YAML pipelines only work with certain version control systems. The following table shows all the supported version control systems and the ones that support YAML pipelines.
