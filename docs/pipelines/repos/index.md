# Build source repositories

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | [Previous versions (XAML builds)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh190721%28v=vs.120%29.aspx)**

## Configure a repository

At the beginning of a pipeline, the agent downloads files from your repository into a local sources directory.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"
If your pipeline consists of multiple jobs, the agent downloads source files at the beginning of each job. You can specify only one source repository for your entire pipeline.

::: moniker range="vsts"
**Azure Pipelines:** To specify the source repository, while editing your pipeline, click the **YAML** or **Tasks** tab, then click **Get sources**, and then select the type of repo that contains your source files.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
**TFS 2018:** To specify the source repository, while editing your pipeline, click the **Tasks** tab, then click **Get sources**, and then select the type of repo that contains your source files.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"
**TFS 2017:** To specify the source repository:

* **TFS 2017.3** Click the **Tasks** tab, then click **Get sources**, and then select the type of repo that contains your source files.

* **TFS 2017 RTM** Click the **Repository** tab, and then select the type of repo that contains your source files.

**TFS 2015:** To specify the source repository, click the **Repository** tab, and then select the type of repo that contains your source files.

## Supported repository types

You can choose from the following repository types:

| Repository type | Azure Pipelines (YAML) | Azure Pipelines (visual designer) | TFS 2018, TFS 2017, TFS 2015.4 | TFS 2015 RTM |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Azure Repos Git           |Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|
| Azure Repos TFVC          |No|Yes|Yes|Yes|
| Bitbucket Cloud           |No|Yes|No|No|
| External Git (generic)    |No|Yes|Yes|Yes|
| GitHub                    |Yes|Yes|No|No|
| GitHub Enterprise         |Yes|Yes|TFS 2018.2 or 2018.3|No|
| Subversion                |No|Yes|Yes|No|

## Specific repository details

See details about building specific repository types:

- [Build Azure Repos Git repositories](azure-repos-git.md)
- [Build GitHub repositories](github.md)
- [Build TFVC repositories](tfvc.md)

> [!NOTE]
> To build code from Subversion, you must install a Subversion client (`svn`) on your [self-hosted build agents](../agents/agents.md#install) or use [Microsoft-hosted build agents](../agents/hosted.md).

## Q & A

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### Why are some repository types not supported by on-premises installations?

When a pipeline uses a remote, 3rd-party repository host such as Bitbucket Cloud, the repository is configured with webhooks that notify Azure Pipelines Server or TFS when code has changed and a build should be triggered. Since on-premises installations are normally protected behind a firewall, 3rd-party webhooks are unable to reach the on-premises server. As a workaround, you can use the **External Git** repository type which uses polling instead of webhooks to trigger a build when code has changed.

### How do I reference the directories on the build agent?

Reference directories using build variables such as `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)` and `$(Build.BinariesDirectory)`. To learn more, see [Build variables](../build/variables.md).
