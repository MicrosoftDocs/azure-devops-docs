If you want the Clean switch described above to work differently, then on the **Variables** tab, define the `Build.Clean` variable and set its value to:

* `all` if you want to delete `$(Agent.BuildDirectory)`, which is the entire working folder that contains the sources folder, binaries folder, artifacts folder, and so on.

* `source` if you want to delete `$(Build.SourcesDirectory)`.

* `binary` If you want to delete `$(Build.BinariesDirectory)`.
