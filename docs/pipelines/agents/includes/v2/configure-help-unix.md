## Unattended config

The agent can be set up from a script with no human intervention.
You must pass `--unattended` and the answers to all questions.

::: moniker range="> tfs-2018"

[!INCLUDE [unattend](./unattended-config.md)]

::: moniker-end

`./config.sh --help` always lists the latest required and optional responses.

## Diagnostics

If you're having trouble with your self-hosted agent, you can try running diagnostics.
After configuring the agent:

```bash
./run.sh --diagnostics
```

This will run through a diagnostic suite that may help you troubleshoot the problem.
The diagnostics feature is available starting with agent version 2.165.0.

## Help on other options

To learn about other options:

```bash
./config.sh --help
```

The help provides information on authentication alternatives and unattended configuration.
