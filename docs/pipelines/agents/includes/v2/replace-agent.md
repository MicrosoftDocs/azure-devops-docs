 ## Replace an agent
 
To replace an agent, follow the *Download and configure the agent* steps again.

 When you configure an agent using the same name as an agent that already exists,
 you're asked if you want to replace the existing agent. If you answer `Y`,
 then make sure you remove the agent (see below) that you're replacing. Otherwise,
 after a few minutes of conflicts, one of the agents will shut down.
