#### Azure Pipelines

Choose **PAT**, and then paste the [PAT token you created](#permissions) into the command prompt window.

> [!NOTE]
> When using PAT as the authentication method, the PAT token is used only for the initial configuration of the agent. Learn more at [Communication with Azure Pipelines or TFS](../../agents.md#communication).

#### TFS or Azure DevOps Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Make sure your server is [configured to support the authentication method](../../agents.md#configure-tfs-authentication) you want to use.
  
When you configure your agent to connect to TFS, you've got the following options:

* **Alternate** Connect to TFS or Azure DevOps Server using Basic authentication. After you select Alternate you'll be prompted for your credentials.

* **Integrated** Not supported on macOS or Linux.

* **Negotiate** (Default) Connect to TFS or Azure DevOps Server as a user other than the signed-in user via a Windows authentication scheme such as NTLM or Kerberos. After you select Negotiate you'll be prompted for credentials.

* **PAT** Supported only on Azure Pipelines and TFS 2017 and newer. After you choose PAT, paste the [PAT token you created](#permissions) into the command prompt window. Use a personal access token (PAT) if your Azure DevOps Server or TFS instance and the agent machine are not in a trusted domain. PAT authentication is handled by your Azure DevOps Server or TFS instance instead of the domain controller.

> [!NOTE]
> When using PAT as the authentication method, the PAT token is used only for the initial configuration of the agent on Azure DevOps Server and the newer versions of TFS. Learn more at [Communication with Azure Pipelines or TFS](../../agents.md).
