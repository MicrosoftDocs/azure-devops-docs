By default, the Windows agent uses the version of Git that is bundled with the agent software. Microsoft recommends using the version of Git that is bundled with the agent, but you have several options to override this default behavior and use the version of Git that the agent machine has installed in the path. 

* Set a pipeline variable named `System.PreferGitFromPath` to `true` in your pipelines.
* On self-hosted agents, you can create a file named **.env** in the agent root directory and add a `System.PreferGitFromPath=true` line to the file. For more information, see [How do I set different environment variables for each individual agent?](../windows-agent.md#how-do-i-set-different-environment-variables-for-each-individual-agent)

To see the version of Git used by a pipeline, you can look at the logs for a `checkout` step in your pipeline, as shown in the following example.

```
Syncing repository: PathFilter (Git)
Prepending Path environment variable with directory containing 'git.exe'.
git version
git version 2.26.2.windows.1
```
