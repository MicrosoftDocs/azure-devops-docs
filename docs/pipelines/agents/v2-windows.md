# Deploy an agent on Windows

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | [TFS 2015](v1-windows.md) | [Previous versions (XAML builds)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms252495%28v=vs.120%29.aspx)**

To build and deploy Windows, Azure, and other Visual Studio solutions you'll need at least one Windows agent. Windows agents can also build Java and Android apps.

> Before you begin:
> * If your code is in [Azure Pipelines](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs) and a [Microsoft-hosted agent](hosted.md) meets your needs, you can skip setting up a private Windows agent.
> * If your code is in an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2015 server, see [Deploy an agent on Windows for on-premises TFS 2015](v1-windows.md).
> *  Otherwise, you've come to the right place to set up an agent on Windows. Continue to the next section.

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/concepts.md)]

## Check prerequisites

Make sure your machine is prepared with our [Windows system prerequisites](https://aka.ms/vstsagentwinsystem).

If you're building from a Subversion repo, you must install the Subversion client on the machine.

### Hardware specs 

The hardware specs for your agents will vary with your needs, team size, etc.
It's not possible to make a general recommendation that will apply to everyone.
As a point of reference, the Azure DevOps team builds its hosted agents using the [hosted agents](hosted.md).
On the other hand, the bulk of the Azure DevOps code is built by 24-core server class machines
running 4 agents apiece.

## Download and configure the agent

::: moniker range="vsts"

### Azure Pipelines

<ol>
<li>Log on to the machine using the account for which you've prepared permissions as explained above.</li>
<li>In your web browser, sign in to Azure Pipelines, and navigate to the **Agent pools** tab:
[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/agent-pools-tab.md)]
</li>

<li>Click **Download agent**.</li>

<li>On the **Get agent** dialog box, click **Windows**.</li>

<li>On the left pane, select the processor architecture of your machine (x86 or x64). </li>

<li>On the right pane, click the **Download** button.

<li>Follow the instructions on the page to download the agent.</li>

<li>Unpack the agent into the directory of your choice. Then run `config.cmd`.</li>

</ol>

> [!Tip]
> Choose the processor according to the installed Windows OS version on your machine. The x64 agent version is intended for 64-bit Windows, whereas the x86 version is intended for 32-bit Windows.
> You can find which version of Windows your machine is running [by following these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/windows-version-search).

### TFS 2017 and TFS 2018

<ol>
<li>Log on to the machine using the account for which you've prepared permissions as explained above.</li>
<li>In your web browser, sign in to TFS, and navigate to the **Agent pools** tab:
[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/agent-pools-tab.md)]
</li>

<li>Click **Download agent**.</li>

<li>On the **Get agent** dialog box, click **Windows**.</li>

<li>Click the **Download** button.

<li>Follow the instructions on the page to download the agent.</li>

<li>Unpack the agent into the directory of your choice. Then run `config.cmd`. Make sure that the path to the directory contains no spaces because tools and scripts don't always properly escape spaces.</li>

</ol>

> [!Note]
> We recommend you configure the agent from an elevated Command Prompt.

### Server URL and authentication

::: moniker range="vsts"
When setup asks for your server URL, for Azure DevOps Services, answer `https://dev.azure.com/{your-organization}`.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 < vsts"
When setup asks for your server URL, for TFS, answer `https://{your_server}/tfs`.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vsts"
When setup asks for your authentication type, choose **PAT**.
Then paste the [PAT token you created](#permissions) into the command prompt window.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 < vsts"
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Make sure your server is [configured to support the authentication method](agents.md#configure-tfs-authentication) you want to use.
  
When you configure your agent to connect to TFS, you've got the following options:

* **Alternate** Connect to TFS using Basic authentication. After you select Alternate you'll be prompted for your credentials.

* **Negotiate** Connect to TFS as a user other than the signed-in user via a Windows authentication scheme such as NTLM or Kerberos. After you select Negotiate you'll be prompted for credentials.

* **Integrated** (Default) Connect a Windows agent to TFS using the credentials of the signed-in user via a Windows authentication scheme such as NTLM or Kerberos. You won't be prompted for credentials after you choose this method.
 
* **PAT** Supported only on Azure Pipelines and TFS 2017 and newer. After you choose PAT, paste the [PAT token you created](#permissions) into the command prompt window. Use a personal access token (PAT) if your TFS instance and the agent machine are not in a trusted domain. PAT authentication is handled by your TFS instance instead of the domain controller.

> [!NOTE]
> When using PAT as the authentication method, the PAT token is used only for the initial configuration of the agent. Learn more at [Communication with Azure Pipelines or TFS](agents.md#communication).

### Choose interactive or service mode

For guidance on whether to run the agent in interactive mode or as a service, see [Agents: Interactive vs. service](agents.md#account).

Note that if you configure as a service, the username you choose to run as should be 20 characters or less.

## Run the agent

 If you configured the agent to run interactively, to run it:

 ```ps
 .\run.cmd
 ```

If you configured the agent to run as a service, it starts automatically. You can view and control the agent running status from the services snap-in. Run `services.msc` and look for "Azure Pipelines Agent (*name of your agent*)".

> [!Note]
> If you need to change the agent's logon account, don't do it from the Services
> snap-in. Instead, see the information below to re-configure the agent.

To use your agent, run a [job](../process/phases.md) using the agent's pool.
If you didn't choose a different pool, your agent will be in the **Default** pool.

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/v2/replace-agent.md)]

## Remove and re-configure an agent

To remove the agent:

```ps
.\config remove
```

After you've removed the agent, you can [configure it again](#download-configure).

## Unattended config

The agent can be set up from a script with no human intervention.
You must pass `--unattended` and the answers to all questions.
Consult `.\config --help` for details about the required responses.

## Help on other options

To learn about other options:

```ps
.\config --help
```

The help provides information on authentication alternatives and unattended configuration.
