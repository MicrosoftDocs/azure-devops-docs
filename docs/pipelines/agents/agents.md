# Azure Pipelines agents

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

To build your code or deploy your software using Azure Pipelines, you need at least one agent. As your codebase and team grow, you need more agents.

When your pipeline runs, the system begins one or more jobs.
An agent is computing infrastructure with installed agent software that runs one job at a time.

Azure Pipelines provides several different types of agents.

| Agent type | Description | Availability |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| [Microsoft-hosted agents](#microsoft-hosted-agents) | Agents hosted and managed by Microsoft | Azure DevOps Services |
| [Self-hosted agents](#install) | Agents that you configure and manage, hosted on your VMs | Azure DevOps Services, Azure DevOps Server |
| [Managed DevOps Pools agents](#managed-devops-pools-agents) | Managed DevOps Pools is a fully managed service where virtual machines or containers powering the agents live in a Microsoft Azure subscription and not in your own Azure subscription | Azure DevOps Services |
| [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents](#azure-virtual-machine-scale-set-agents) | A form of self-hosted agents, using Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, that can be autoscaled to meet demands. <br><br>If you're considering using auto-scalable self-hosted agent pools, we recommend looking at Managed DevOps Pools. For more information, see [Compare Managed DevOps Pools with Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents](../../managed-devops-pools/migrate-from-scale-set-agents.md) and [Managed DevOps Pools overview](../../managed-devops-pools/overview.md). | Azure DevOps Services |


::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
Jobs can be run [directly on the host machine of the agent](../process/phases.md) or [in a container](../process/container-phases.md).
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

## Microsoft-hosted agents

[!INCLUDE [include](includes/hosted-agent-intro.md)]

[Learn more about Microsoft-hosted agents](hosted.md).

::: moniker-end

<a id="install"></a>

## Self-hosted agents

An agent that you set up and manage on your own to run jobs is a **self-hosted agent**.
You can use self-hosted agents in Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server.
Self-hosted agents give you more control to install dependent software needed for your builds and deployments.
Also, machine-level caches and configuration persist from run to run, which can boost speed.

> [!NOTE]
> Although multiple agents can be installed per machine, we strongly suggest to only install one agent per machine. Installing two or more agents might adversely affect performance and the result of your pipelines.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!TIP]
> Before you install a self-hosted agent, you might want to see if a Microsoft-hosted agent pool works for you. In many cases, a Microsoft-hosted agent pool is the simplest way to get going. [Give it a try](hosted.md).

:::moniker-end

You can install the agent on Linux, macOS, or Windows machines. You can also install an agent on a Docker container. For more information about installing a self-hosted agent, see:

* [macOS agent](osx-agent.md)
* [Linux agent](linux-agent.md)
* [Windows agent](windows-agent.md)
* [Docker agent](docker.md)

> [!NOTE]
> On macOS, you need to clear the special attribute on the download archive to prevent Gatekeeper protection from displaying for each assembly in the tar file when `./config.sh` is run. The following command clears the extended attribute on the file:
>
> ```bash
> xattr -c vsts-agent-osx-x64-V.v.v.tar.gz  ## replace V.v.v with the version in the filename downloaded.
> 
> # then unpack the gzip tar file normally:
> 
> tar xvfz vsts-agent-osx-x64-V.v.v.tar.gz
> ```

After you install the agent on a machine, you can install any other software on that machine as required by your jobs.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!NOTE]
> Agents are widely backward compatible. Any version of the agent should be compatible with any Azure DevOps version as long as Azure DevOps isn't demanding a higher version of the agent.
>
> We only support the most recent version of the agent since that is the only version guaranteed to have all up-to-date patches and bug fixes.

### Node runner versions

The agent ships with several versions of NodeJS libraries to support target tasks that use different Node handlers.

All official Azure DevOps tasks use Node 20 as a universal handler, however, customers might still use custom tasks that use the end-of-life Node 6, Node 10, or Node 16 libraries. To support backward compatibility with Node that reached End-of-Life, we provide the following self-service methods to install the designated Node runner manually.

* Manually install the Node 6 runner. For more information, see [Node 6 support](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/blob/master/docs/noderunner.md).
* Use the [NodeTaskRunnerInstaller@0](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/node-task-runner-installer-v0) task in your pipelines that require the outdated Node 6 library.
* Install an agent package that includes Node 6.
  
  Azure Pipelines provides two versions of agent packages.

  * **vsts-agent-\*** packages support Node 6.
  * **pipelines-agent-\*** packages don't support Node 6. This version of the package will become the default agent package in the future.

  If you know that you aren't using any Node 6 dependant tasks, and you don't want Node 6 installed on your agent machine, you can install the agent from the **Alternate Agent Downloads** section from [https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases).

## Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents are a form of self-hosted agents that can be autoscaled to meet your demands. This elasticity reduces your need to run dedicated agents all the time. Unlike Microsoft-hosted agents, you have flexibility over the size and the image of machines on which agents run.

You specify a Virtual Machine Scale Set, the number of agents to keep on standby, a maximum number of virtual machines in the scale set, and Azure Pipelines manages the scaling of your agents for you.

For more information, see [Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set agents](scale-set-agents.md).

[!INCLUDE [mdp-recommended](../../managed-devops-pools/includes/mdp-recommended.md)] 

## Managed DevOps Pools agents

Managed DevOps Pools empowers development teams to quickly and easily spin up Azure DevOps agent pools that are tailored to a team's specific needs. 

Managed DevOps Pools:

- implements security best practices
- provides knobs to balance cost and performance
- provides paths for the most common scenarios
- significantly reduces time spent in creating and maintaining custom pools

Managed DevOps Pools is an evolution of Azure DevOps Virtual Machine Scale Set agent pools, They simplify custom pool creation even further by improving scalability and reliability of custom pools. Managed DevOps Pools is a fully managed service where virtual machines or containers powering the agents live in a Microsoft Azure subscription and not in your own Azure subscription, like when using Azure DevOps Virtual Machine Scale Set agent pools. For more information, see the [Managed DevOps Pools](../../managed-devops-pools/index.yml) documentation.

::: moniker-end

## Parallel jobs

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

**Parallel jobs** represents the number of jobs you can run at the same time in your organization. If your organization has a single parallel job, you can run a single job at a time in your organization, with any other concurrent jobs being queued until the first job completes. To run two jobs at the same time, you need two parallel jobs. In Azure Pipelines, you can run parallel jobs on Microsoft-hosted infrastructure or on your own (self-hosted) infrastructure. 

Microsoft provides a free tier of service by default in every organization that includes at least one parallel job. Depending on the number of concurrent pipelines you need to run, you might need more parallel jobs to use multiple Microsoft-hosted or self-hosted agents at the same time. For more information on parallel jobs and different free tiers of service, see [Parallel jobs in Azure Pipelines](../licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

You might need more parallel jobs to use multiple agents at the same time:

* [Parallel jobs in Azure DevOps Server](../licensing/concurrent-pipelines-tfs.md)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with Azure DevOps Server 2019, you don't have to pay for self-hosted concurrent jobs in releases. You're only limited by the number of agents that you have.

::: moniker-end

<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>

Every self-hosted agent has a set of capabilities that indicate what it can do. Capabilities are name-value pairs that are either automatically discovered by the agent software, called **system capabilities**, or capabilities that you define, called **user capabilities**.

The agent software automatically determines various system capabilities such as the name of the machine, type of operating system, and versions of certain software installed on the machine. Also, environment variables defined in the machine automatically appear in the list of system capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> Storing environment variables as capabilities means that when an agent runs, the stored capability values are used to set the environment variables. Also, any changes to environment variables that are made while the agent is running aren't picked up and used by any task. If you have sensitive environment variables that change and you don't want them to be stored as capabilities, you can have them ignored by setting the `VSO_AGENT_IGNORE` environment variable, with a comma-delimited list of variables to ignore. For example, `PATH` is a critical variable that you might want to ignore if you're installing software.   

When you author a pipeline, you specify certain **demands** of the agent. The system sends the job only to agents that have capabilities matching the [demands](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/pool-demands) specified in the pipeline. As a result, agent capabilities allow you to direct jobs to specific agents.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Demands and capabilities are designed for use with self-hosted agents so that jobs can be matched with an agent that 
> meets the requirements of the job. When using Microsoft-hosted agents, you select an image for the agent that 
> matches the requirements of the job. Although it's possible to add capabilities to a Microsoft-hosted agent, you don't need 
> to use capabilities with Microsoft-hosted agents.

### Configure demands

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

:::moniker range=">=azure-devops-2019"

To add a demand to your YAML build pipeline, add the `demands:` line to the `pool` section.

```yaml
pool:
  name: Default
  demands: SpecialSoftware # exists check for SpecialSoftware
```

You can check for the existence of a capability, or make a comparison with the value of a capability. For more information, see [YAML schema - Demands](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/pool-demands).

:::moniker-end



# [Classic](#tab/classic)

In the Tasks tab of the pipeline, add the demand to your agent job.

| Name | Condition | Value |
|---|---|---|
| SpecialSoftware | exists | N/A |
| Agent.OS | equals | Linux |

---

### Configure agent capabilities

#### [Azure Pipelines UI](#tab/browser)

You can view the details of an agent, including its version and system capabilities, and manage its user capabilities, by navigating to **Agent pools** and selecting the **Capabilities** tab for the desired agent.

1. In your web browser, navigate to Agent pools:

   [!INCLUDE [agent-pools-tab](includes/agent-pools-tab.md)]

1. Navigate to the capabilities tab:
 
   [!INCLUDE [agent-capabilities](includes/agent-capabilities-tab.md)]

1. To register a new capability with the agent, choose **Add a new capability**.

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli/)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can view the details of an agent, including its version and capabilities, by using the following [az pipelines agent](/cli/azure/pipelines/agent) Azure CLI methods.

- To run tasks using Windows authentication to access an external service, the agent must run under an account with access to that service in pipelines or variable groups when exchanged with the agent.

The payload of the messages exchanged between the agent and Azure Pipelines are secured using asymmetric encryption. Each agent has a public-private key pair, and the public key is exchanged with the server during registration. The server uses the public key to encrypt the payload of the job before sending it to the agent. The agent decrypts the job content using its private key.gentCloudRequest": null,
 

```json


  <Some properties omitted for space>

  "status": "offline",
  "statusChangedOn": null,
  "systemCapabilities": {
    "ANDROID_HOME": "",
    "ANDROID_NDK_HOME": "",
    "Agent.Name": "Hosted Agent",
    "Agent.Version": "2.160.1",

    <Some capabilities omitted for space>

    "sh": "",
    "subversion": "",
    "svn": "",
    "To run tasks using Windows authentication to access an external service, the agent must run under an account with access to that service.
```



However, if you're running UI tests such as Selenium or Coded UI tests that require a browser, the browser is launched in the context of the agent account.

On Windows, you should consider using a service account such as Network Service or Local Service. These accounts have restricted permissions and nonexpiring passwords, reducing the need for agent management over time.

These credentials are different from the credentials that you use when you register the agent with Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server.

<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

### Communication with Azure Pipelines

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<azure-devops"

### Communication with Azure DevOps Server

::: moniker-end


The agent communicates with Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server to determine which job it needs to run, and to report the logs and job status. The agent always initiates this communication. All the messages from the agent to Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server happen over HTTP or HTTPS, depending on how you configure the agent. This pull model allows the agent to be configured in different topologies as shown by the following examples.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
![Agent topologies in on-premises installations.](media/agent-topologies-tfs.png)
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
![Agent topologies in Azure DevOps Services.](media/agent-topologies-devops.png)
::: moniker-end

Here's a common communication pattern between the agent and Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server.

1. The user registers an agent with Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server by adding it to an [agent pool](pools-queues.md). You need to be an [agent pool administrator](pools-queues.md#security) to register an agent in that agent pool. The identity of agent pool administrator is needed only at the time of registration and isn't persisted on the agent. It isn't used in any further communication between the agent and Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server. Once the registration is complete, the agent downloads a _listener OAuth token_ and uses it to listen to the job queue.

2. The agent listens to see if a new job request is posted for it in the job queue in Azure Pipelines/Azure DevOps Server using an HTTP long poll. When a job is available, the agent downloads the job and a _job-specific OAuth token_. Azure Pipelines/Azure DevOps Server generates a short-lived token for the scoped identity [specified in the pipeline](../build/options.md). The token is used by the agent to access or modify resources on Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server within that job. For example, to access source code or upload test results.

3. The agent discards the job-specific OAuth token after the job is completed, then goes back to checking if there's a new job request using the listener OAuth token.

The payload of the messages exchanged between the agent and Azure Pipelines/Azure DevOps Server are secured using asymmetric encryption. Each agent has a public-private key pair, and the public key is exchanged with the server during registration. The server uses the public key to encrypt the payload of the job before sending it to the agent. The agent decrypts the job content using its private key. This method secures secrets stored in pipelines or variable groups when exchanged with the agent.

> [!NOTE]
> The agent provides support for UTF-8 client encoding output. 
> However, if your system has a different encoding from UTF-8, you might encounter some problems with the output of logs. For example, the logs might contain characters that your system’s encoding doesn't recognize, so they might appear as garbled or missing symbols.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

### Communication to deploy to target servers

When you use the agent to deploy artifacts to a set of servers, it must have "line of sight"
connectivity to those servers. The Microsoft-hosted agent pools, by default, have
connectivity to Azure websites and servers running in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> If your Azure resources are running in an Azure Virtual Network, you can get the 
> [Agent IP ranges](hosted.md#agent-ip-ranges) where Microsoft-hosted agents are deployed 
> so you can configure the firewall rules for your Azure VNet to allow access by the agent.

If your on-premises environments don't have connectivity to a Microsoft-hosted agent pool, which is typically the case due to intermediate firewalls, you need to manually configure self-hosted agents on on-premises computers. The agents must have connectivity to the target on-premises environments, and access to the internet to connect to Azure Pipelines or Team Foundation Server,
as shown in the following schematic.

![Agent connectivity for on-premises environments](media/agent-connections-devops.png)
::: moniker-end

<a name="configure-tfs-authentication"></a>
## Authentication

To register an agent, you need to be a member of the [administrator role](pools-queues.md#security) in the agent pool. The identity of agent pool administrator is needed only at the time of registration and isn't persisted on the agent. It isn't used in any subsequent communication between the agent and Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server. In addition, you must be a local administrator on the server in order to configure the agent.

When you register an agent, choose from the following authentication types, and agent setup prompts you for the specific additional information required for each authentication type. For more information, see [Self-hosted agent authentication options](./agent-authentication-options.md).

[!INCLUDE [agent-setup-authentication-type](./includes/agent-setup-authentication.md)]

:::moniker range="<= azure-devops-2022"

Additionally, Windows agents have the following two authentication options on Azure DevOps Server.

* [**Negotiate**](./agent-authentication-options.md#negotiate) Connect to Azure DevOps Server as a user other than the signed-in user via a Windows authentication scheme such as New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) or Kerberos. After selecting Negotiate, you're prompted for credentials.
* [**Integrated**](./agent-authentication-options.md#integrated) (Default) Connect a Windows agent to Azure DevOps Server using the credentials of the signed-in user via a Windows authentication scheme such as NTLM or Kerberos. You won't be prompted for credentials after you choose this method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your server must be [configured to support the authentication method](agents.md#configure-tfs-authentication) to use Alternate, Negotiate, or Integrated authentication.

:::moniker-end

The authentication method used for registering the agent is used only during agent registration. To learn more about how agents communicate with Azure Pipelines after registration, see [Communication with Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server](#communication).


<h2 id="interactive-or-service">Interactive vs. service</h2>

You can run your self-hosted agent as either a service or an interactive process.

After you configure the agent, we recommend you first try it
in interactive mode to make sure it works. Then, for production use,
we recommend you run the agent in one of the following modes so
that it reliably remains in a running state. These modes also
ensure that the agent starts automatically if the machine is restarted.

1. **As a service**. You can use the service manager of the
   operating system to manage the lifecycle of the agent. In addition, the experience for autoupgrading the agent is better when you run the agent as a service.

1. **As an interactive process with auto-logon enabled**. In some cases,
   you might need to run the agent interactively for production use -
   such as to run UI tests. When the agent is configured to run in this
   mode, the screen saver is also disabled. Some domain policies might
   prevent you from enabling autologon or disabling the screen saver. In such cases, you might need to seek an exemption from the domain policy, or run the agent on a workgroup computer where the domain policies don't apply.

   > [!NOTE]
   > There are security risks when you enable automatic logon
   > or disable the screen saver because you enable other users to walk
   > up to the computer and use the account that automatically logs on. If you configure the agent to run
   > in this way, you must ensure the computer is physically protected;
   > for example, located in a secure facility. If you use
   > Remote Desktop to access the computer on which an agent is running
   > with autologon, simply closing the Remote Desktop causes the
   > computer to be locked and any UI tests that run on this agent might
   > fail. To avoid this issue, use the [tscon](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tscon)
   > command to disconnect from Remote Desktop. For example:
   >
   > `%windir%\System32\tscon.exe 1 /dest:console`

<h2 id="account">Agent account</h2>

Whether you run an agent as a service or interactively, you can choose
which computer account you use to run the agent. The choice of agent account depends solely on the needs of the tasks running in your build and deployment jobs.


For example, to run tasks using Windows authentication to access an external service, the agent must run using an account with access to that service. However, if you're running UI tests such as Selenium or Coded UI tests that require a browser, the browser is launched in the context of the agent account.

On Windows, you should consider using a service account such as Network Service or Local Service. These accounts permissions are restricted and their passwords don't expire, meaning the agent requires less management over time.

These credentials are different from the credentials that you use when you register the agent with Azure Pipelines or Azure DevOps Server.

## Agent version and upgrades

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

We update the agent software every few weeks in Azure Pipelines.
We indicate the agent version in the format `{major}.{minor}`.
For instance, if the agent version is `2.1`, then the major version is `2` and the minor version is `1`.

Microsoft-hosted agents are always kept up-to-date. If the newer version of the agent is only different in _minor_ version, Azure Pipelines can automatically update self-hosted agents. You can configure this setting in **Agent pools**, select your agent, **Settings** - the default is enabled. An upgrade is requested when a platform feature or one of the tasks used in the pipeline requires a newer version of the agent.

If you run a self-hosted agent interactively, or if there's a newer _major_ version of the agent available, then you might have to manually upgrade the agents. You can upgrade the agents easily from the **Agent pools** tab under your organization. Pipelines can't run without a compatible agent

### To update self-hosted agents

1. Navigate to **Project settings**, **Agent pools**.

    ![Project settings, Agent pools](media/agent-queues-tab/agent-queues.png)

2. Select your agent pool and choose **Update all agents**.

    ![Update all agents](media/agents/update-all-agents.png)

    You can also update agents individually by choosing **Update agent** from the **...** menu.

    ![Update agent](media/agents/update-agent.png)

3. Select **Update** to confirm the update.

    ![Update all agents confirmation](media/agents/update-all-agents-confirmation.png)

4. An update request is queued for each agent in the pool, and runs when any currently running jobs complete. Upgrading typically only takes a few moments - long enough to download the latest version of the agent software (approximately 200 MB), unzip it, and restart the agent with the new version. You can monitor the status of your agents on the **Agents** tab.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

We update the agent software with every update in Azure DevOps Server.
We indicate the agent version in the format `{major}.{minor}`.
For instance, if the agent version is `2.1`, then the major version is 2 and the minor version is 1.

When your Azure DevOps Server has a newer version of the agent, and that newer agent is only different in _minor_ version, it can usually be automatically upgraded.
An upgrade is requested when a platform feature or one of the tasks used in the pipeline requires a newer version of the agent.
Starting with Azure DevOps Server 2019, you don't have to wait for a new server release.
You can [upload a new version of the agent to your application tier](#can-i-update-my-agents-that-are-part-of-an-azure-devops-server-pool), and that version is offered as an upgrade.

If you run the agent interactively, or if there's a newer _major_ version of the agent available, then you might have to manually upgrade the agents. You can easily upgrade the agent from the **Agent pools** tab under your project collection. Pipelines can't run without a compatible agent.

::: moniker-end

You can view the version of an agent by navigating to **Agent pools** and selecting the **Capabilities** tab for the desired agent, as described in [Configure agent capabilities](#configure-agent-capabilities).

To trigger agent update programmatically, you can use Agent update API as described in section [How can I trigger agent updates programmatically for specific agent pool?](#how-can-i-trigger-agent-updates-programmatically-for-specific-agent-pool).

<h3 id="private-agent-performance-advantages">Do self-hosted agents have any performance advantages over Microsoft-hosted agents?</h3>

In many cases, yes. Specifically:

* If you use a self-hosted agent, you can run incremental builds. For example, if you define a pipeline that doesn't clean the repo and doesn't perform a clean build, your builds typically run faster. You don't get these benefits with a Microsoft-hosted agent unless you use features such as [caching](../release/caching.md) because the agent is destroyed after the pipeline is completed.

* A Microsoft-hosted agent can take longer to start your build. While it often takes just a few seconds for your job to be assigned to a Microsoft-hosted agent, it can sometimes take several minutes for an agent to be allocated depending on the load on our system.

### Can I install multiple self-hosted agents on the same machine?

Yes. This approach can work well for agents that run jobs that don't consume many shared resources. For example, you could try it for agents that run releases that mostly orchestrate deployments and don't do much work on the agent itself.

You might find that in other cases you don't gain much efficiency by running multiple agents on the same machine. For example, it might not be worthwhile for agents that run builds that consume much disk and I/O resources.

You might also run into problems if parallel build jobs are using the same singleton tool deployment, such as npm packages. For example, one build might update a dependency while another build is in the middle of using it, which could cause unreliable results and errors.

### What’s the behavior of agents when the pipeline jobs are canceled?

For Microsoft-hosted agents, the agent is torn down and returned to the Azure Pipelines pool.

For self-hosted agents:

When a pipeline is canceled, the agent sends a sequence of commands to the process executing the current step. 

* The first command is sent with a time out of 7.5 seconds. 
* If the process doesn't terminate, a second command is sent with a 2.5-second time out.
* If the process doesn't terminate, the agent commands it to be killed.
* If the process ignores the two initial termination requests, it's forcibly killed.

From the initial request to termination takes approximately 10 seconds.

The commands issued to the process to cancel the pipeline differ based on the agent operating system.

* macOS and Linux - The commands sent are SIGINT, followed by SIGTERM, followed by SIGKILL.
* Windows - The commands sent to the process are Ctrl+C, followed by Ctrl+Break, followed by Process.Kill.

### How can I trigger agent updates programmatically for specific agent pool?

You can trigger agent updates for the pool by using the following API:

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

```
POST https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/distributedtask/pools/{poolId}/messages?agentId={agentId}&api-version=6.0
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<azure-devops"

```
POST https://{server url}/tfs/{collection}/_apis/distributedtask/pools/{poolId}/messages?agentId={agentId}&api-version=6.0
```
