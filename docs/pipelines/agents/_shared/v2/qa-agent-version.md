### How do I make sure I have the latest v2 agent version?

0. Go to the _Agent pools_ control panel tab:
[!INCLUDE [agent-pools-tab](../../_shared/agent-pools-tab.md)]

0. Click the pool that contains the agent.

0. Make sure the agent is enabled.

0. Click **Agents**.

0. Click **Capabilities**.

0. Look for the `Agent.Version` capability.
 > You can check this value against the latest published agent version. See [Azure Pipelines Agent](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases) and check the page for the highest version number listed.

1. Each agent automatically updates itself when it runs a task that requires a newer version of the agent. But if you want to manually update some agents, right-click the pool, and then choose **Update all agents**.

### Can I update my v2 agents that are part of an Azure DevOps Server pool?

Yes. You can configure your Azure DevOps Server to look for the agent package files on a local disk, overriding the default version that came with the server (at the time of its release). This scenario also applies when the server does not have access to the Internet.

0. From a computer with Internet access, download the latest version of the agent package files (in .zip or .tar.gz form) from the [Azure Pipelines Agent GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases).

0. Transfer the downloaded package files to each Azure DevOps Server Application Tier, via a method of your choice (e.g. USB drive, Network transfer). Place the agent files under the `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Azure DevOps\Agents` folder.
**Note**: in Azure DevOps Server 2019 RC1, the folder is called `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\DevOps\Agents`.

0. You're all set! Your Azure DevOps Server will now use the local files whenever the agents need to be updated. Each agent automatically updates itself when it runs a task that requires a newer version of the agent. But if you want to manually update some agents, right-click the pool, and then choose **Update all agents**.
