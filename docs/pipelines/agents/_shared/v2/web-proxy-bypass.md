### How do I configure the agent to bypass a web proxy and connect to Azure Pipelines?

If you want the agent to bypass your proxy and connect to Azure Pipelines directly, then you should configure your web proxy to enable the agent to access the following URLs.

#### For organizations using the `*.visualstudio.com` domain:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com
https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com 
https://{organization_name}.visualstudio.com
https://{organization_name}.vsrm.visualstudio.com
https://{organization_name}.vstmr.visualstudio.com
https://{organization_name}.pkgs.visualstudio.com
https://{organization_name}.vssps.visualstudio.com
```

#### For organizations using the `dev.azure.com` domain:

```
https://dev.azure.com
https://*.dev.azure.com
https://login.microsoftonline.com
https://management.core.windows.net
```

To ensure your organization works with any existing firewall or IP restrictions, ensure that `dev.azure.com` and `*dev.azure.com` are open and update your allow-listed IPs to include the following IP addresses, based on your IP version. If you're currently allow-listing the `13.107.6.183` and `13.107.9.183` IP addresses, leave them in place, as you don't need to remove them.

**IPv4 ranges**

* `13.107.6.0/24`
* `13.107.9.0/24`
* `13.107.42.0/24`
* `13.107.43.0/24`

**IPv6 ranges**

* `2620:1ec:4::/48`
* `2620:1ec:a92::/48`
* `2620:1ec:21::/48`
* `2620:1ec:22::/48`

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure enables the agent to bypass a web proxy. Your build pipeline and scripts must still handle bypassing your web proxy for each task and tool you run in your build.
>
> For example, if you are using a NuGet task, you must configure your web proxy to support bypassing the URL for the server that hosts the NuGet feed you're using.
