If your build and release definitions are in VSTS, then you've got a convenient option to build and deploy using a **hosted agent**. When you use a hosted agent, we take care of the maintenance and upgrades. So for many teams this is the simplest way to build and deploy. You can try it first and see if it works for your build or deployment. If not, you can set up a private agent.
