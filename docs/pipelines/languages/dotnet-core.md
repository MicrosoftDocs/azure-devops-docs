# Build, test, and deploy .NET Core apps in Azure Pipelines

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**

This guidance explains how to use Azure Pipelines or Team Foundation Server (TFS) to automatically build .NET Core projects and deploy or publish to targets with CI/CD pipelines.

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/concept-rename-note.md)]

This guidance explains how to build .NET Core projects.

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"

> [!NOTE]
> 
> This guidance applies to TFS version 2017.3 and newer.

::: moniker-end

## Example

This example shows how to build a .NET Core project. To start, import this repo into Azure Repos or TFS, or fork it into GitHub:

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-dotnet-core
```

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

The sample code includes an `azure-pipelines.yml` file at the root of the repository.
You can use this file to build the app.

Follow all the instructions in [Create your first pipeline](../get-started-yaml.md) to create a pipeline for the sample app.

To learn more about YAML, see [YAML schema reference](../yaml-schema.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

YAML builds aren't yet available on TFS.

::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

::: moniker range="< vsts"
> [!NOTE]
> This scenario works on TFS, but some of the following instructions might not exactly match the version of TFS that you're using. Also, you'll need to set up a self-hosted agent and possibly also install software. If you're a new user, you might have a better learning experience if you try this procedure out first by using a free Azure DevOps Services organization. Then change the selector in the upper-left corner of this page from Team Foundation Server to **Azure DevOps Services**.  
::: moniker-end

* After you have the sample code in your own repository, create a pipeline by using the instructions in [Your first build and release](../get-started-designer.md) and select the **ASP.NET Core** template. This selection automatically adds the tasks required to build the code in the sample repository.

* Save the pipeline and queue a build to see it in action.

---

Read through the rest of this topic to learn some of the common ways to customize your .NET Core pipeline.

## Build environment

::: moniker range="vsts"

You can use Azure Pipelines to build your .NET Core projects on Windows, Linux, or macOS without needing to set up any infrastructure of your own. 
The [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) in Azure Pipelines have several released versions of the .NET Core SDKs preinstalled.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file to select the appropriate agent pool:

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04' # other options: 'macOS-10.13', 'vs2017-win2016'
```

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

Use the **Hosted VS2017** agent pool (to build on Windows), the **Hosted Ubuntu 1604** agent pool, or the **Hosted macOS Preview** pool.
To change the OS on which to build, select **Tasks**, then select the **Process** node, and finally select the **Agent pool** that you want to use.

---

The Microsoft-hosted agents don't include some of the older versions of the .NET Core SDK. 
They also don't typically include prerelease versions. If you need these kinds of SDKs on Microsoft-hosted agents, add the **.NET Core Tool Installer** task to the beginning of your process.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

If you need a version of the .NET Core SDK that isn't already installed on the Microsoft-hosted agent, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreInstaller@0
  inputs:
    version: '2.1.300' # replace this value with the version that you need for your project
```

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

If you need a version of the .NET Core SDK that isn't already installed on the Microsoft-hosted agent, take the following steps:

1. In the pipeline, select **Tasks**. Choose the job that runs your build tasks. Then select **+** to add a new task to that job.

1. In the task catalog, find and add the **.NET Core Tool Installer** task.

1. Select the task and specify the version of the .NET Core SDK or runtime that you want to install.

---

> [!TIP]
>
> As an alternative, you can set up a [self-hosted agent](../agents/agents.md#install) and save the cost of running the tool installer.
> You can also use self-hosted agents to save additional time if you have a large repository or you run incremental builds.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

You can build your .NET Core projects by using the .NET Core SDK and runtime on Windows, Linux, or macOS. 
Your builds run on a [self-hosted agent](../agents/agents.md#install). 
Make sure that you have the necessary version of the .NET Core SDK and runtime installed on the agent.

::: moniker-end

## Restore dependencies

NuGet is a popular way to depend on code that you don't build. You can download NuGet packages by running 
the `dotnet restore` command either through the 
[.NET Core](../tasks/build/dotnet-core.md) task or directly in a script in your pipeline.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

You can download NuGet packages from Azure Artifacts, NuGet.org, or some other external or internal NuGet repository.
The **.NET Core** task is especially useful to restore packages from authenticated NuGet feeds.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< tfs-2018"

You can download NuGet packages from NuGet.org.

::: moniker-end

`dotnet restore` internally uses a version of `NuGet.exe` that is packaged with the .NET Core SDK. `dotnet restore` can only restore packages specified in the .NET Core project `.csproj` files. 
If you also have a Microsoft .NET Framework project in your solution or use `package.json` to specify your dependencies, you must also use the **NuGet** task to restore those dependencies.

::: moniker range="< tfs-2018"

In .NET Core SDK version 2.0 and newer, packages are restored automatically when running other commands such as `dotnet build`.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

In .NET Core SDK version 2.0 and newer, packages are restored automatically when running other commands such as `dotnet build`.
However, you might still need to use the **.NET Core** task to restore packages if you use an authenticated feed.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

If your builds occasionally fail when restoring packages from NuGet.org due to connection issues, 
you can use Azure Artifacts in conjunction with [upstream sources](../../artifacts/concepts/upstream-sources.md) 
and cache the packages. The credentials of the pipeline are automatically used when connecting 
to Azure Artifacts. These credentials are typically derived from the **Project Collection Build Service** 
account.

If you want to specify a NuGet repository, put the URLs in a `NuGet.config` file in your repository. 
If your feed is authenticated, manage its credentials by creating a NuGet service connection in the **Services** tab under **Project Settings**.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vsts"

If you use Microsoft-hosted agents, you get a new machine every time your run a build, which means restoring the packages every time. 
This restoration can take a significant amount of time. To mitigate this issue, you can either use Azure Artifacts or a self-hosted agent, in which case, 
you get the benefit of using the package cache.

::: moniker-end

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"  

To restore packages, use the `dotnet restore` command:

```yaml
- script: dotnet restore
```

Or to restore packages from a custom feed, use the **.NET Core** task:

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: restore
    projects: '**/*.csproj'
    feedsToUse: config
    nugetConfigPath: NuGet.config    # Relative to root of the repository
    externalFeedCredentials: <Name of the NuGet service connection>
```

For more information about NuGet service connections, see [publish to NuGet feeds](../artifacts/nuget.md).
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"
YAML builds aren't yet available on TFS.  
::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

1. Select **Tasks** in the pipeline. Select the job that runs your build tasks. Then select **+** to add a new task to that job.

1. In the task catalog, find and add the **.NET Core** task.

1. Select the task and, for **Command**, select **restore**.

1. Specify any other options you need for this task. Then save the build.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Make sure the custom feed is specified in your `NuGet.config` file and that credentials are specified in the NuGet service connection.

---

## Build your project

You build your .NET Core project by running the `dotnet build` command in your pipeline.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

To build your project by using the .NET Core task, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- script: dotnet build # Include additional options such as --configuration to meet your need
```

You can run any `dotnet` command in your pipeline. The following example shows how to install and use a .NET global tool, [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/):

```yaml
- script: dotnet tool install -g dotnetsay
- script: dotnetsay
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

YAML builds aren't yet available on TFS.

::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

### Build

1. Select **Tasks** in the pipeline. Select the job that runs your build tasks. Then select **+** to add a new task to that job.

1. In the task catalog, find and add the **.NET Core** task.

1. Select the task and, for **Command**, select **build** or **publish**.

1. Specify any other options you need for this task. Then save the build.

### Install a tool

To install a .NET Core global tool like [dotnetsay](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnetsay/) in your build running on Windows, take the following steps:

1. Add the **.NET Core** task and set the following properties:
   * **Command**: custom.
    * **Path to projects**: _leave empty_.
   * **Custom command**: tool.
   * **Arguments**: `install -g dotnetsay`.

2. Add a **Command Line** task and set the following properties:
   * **Script:** `dotnetsay`.

---

## Run your tests

Use the **.NET Core** task to run unit tests in your .NET Core solution by using testing frameworks like MSTest, xUnit, and NUnit. 
One benefit of using this built-in task instead of a script to run your tests is that the results of the tests are automatically published to the server. 
These results are then made available to you in the build summary and can be used for troubleshooting failed tests and test-timing analysis.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration)'
```

An alternative is to run the `dotnet test` command with a specific logger and then use the **Publish Test Results** task:

```yaml
- script: dotnet test <test-project> --logger trx
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
  inputs:
    testRunner: VSTest
    testResultsFiles: '**/*.trx'
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

YAML builds aren't yet available on TFS.

::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

Use the **.NET Core** task with **Command** set to **test**. 
**Path to projects** should refer to the test projects in your solution.

---

## Collect code coverage 

If you're building on the Windows platform, code coverage metrics can be collected by using the built-in coverage data collector. For this functionality, the test project must reference [Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Test.SDK) version 15.8.0 or higher. 
If you use the **.NET Core** task to run tests, coverage data is automatically published to the server. The **.coverage** file can be downloaded from the build summary for viewing in Visual Studio.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: test
    projects: '**/*Tests/*.csproj'
    arguments: '--configuration $(buildConfiguration) --collect "Code coverage"'
```

If you choose to run the `dotnet test` command, specify the test results logger and coverage options. Then use the [Publish Test Results](../tasks/test/publish-test-results.md) task:

```yaml
- script: dotnet test <test-project> --logger trx --collect "Code coverage"
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  inputs:
    testRunner: VSTest
    testResultsFiles: '**/*.trx'
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

YAML builds aren't yet available on TFS.

::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

1. Add the .NET Core task to your build job and set the following properties:

   * **Command**: test.
   * **Path to projects**: _Should refer to the test projects in your solution_.
   * **Arguments**: `--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --collect "Code coverage"`.

2. Ensure that the **Publish test results** option remains selected.

---

> [!TIP]
> If you're building on Linux or macOS, you can use [Coverlet](https://github.com/tonerdo/coverlet) or a similar tool to collect code coverage metrics.
> Code coverage results can be published to the server by using the [Publish Code Coverage Results](../tasks/test/publish-code-coverage-results.md) task. To leverage this functionality, the coverage tool must be configured to generate results in Cobertura or JaCoCo coverage format.

## Package and deliver your code

After you've built and tested your app, you can upload the build output to Azure Pipelines or TFS, create and publish a NuGet package, 
or package the build output into a .zip file to be deployed to a web application.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

### Publish artifacts to Azure Pipelines

To simply publish the output of your build to Azure Pipelines, add the following code to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
```

This code takes all the files in `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` and upload them as an artifact of your build. For this task to work, you must have already published the output of your build to this directory by using the `dotnet publish --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)` command. To copy additional files to this directory before publishing, see [Utility: copy files](../tasks/utility/copy-files.md).

### Publish to a NuGet feed

To create and publish a NuGet package, add the following snippet:

```yaml
- script: dotnet pack /p:PackageVersion=$(version)  # define version variable elsewhere in your pipeline

- task: NuGetCommand@2
  inputs:
    command: push
    nuGetFeedType: external
    publishFeedCredentials: '<Name of the NuGet service connection>'
    versioningScheme: byEnvVar
    versionEnvVar: version
```

For more information about versioning and publishing NuGet packages, see [publish to NuGet feeds](../artifacts/nuget.md).

### Deploy a web app

To create a .zip file archive that's ready for publishing to a web app, add the following snippet:

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  inputs:
    command: publish
    publishWebProjects: True
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    zipAfterPublish: True
```

To publish this archive to a web app, see [Azure Web Apps deployment](../targets/webapp.md).  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

YAML builds aren't yet available on TFS.

::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

### Publish artifacts to Azure Pipelines

To simply publish the output of your build to Azure Pipelines or TFS, use the **Publish Artifacts** task.

### Publish to a NuGet feed

If you want to publish your code to a NuGet feed, take the following steps:

1. Use a .NET Core task with **Command** set to pack.

1. [Publish your package to a NuGet feed](../artifacts/nuget.md).

### Deploy a web app

1. Use a .NET Core task with **Command** set to publish.

1. Make sure you've selected the option to create a .zip file archive.

1. To publish this archive to a web app, see [Azure Web Apps deployment](../targets/webapp.md).

## Build a container

You can build a Docker container image after you build your project. For more information, see [Docker](docker.md).

## Troubleshooting

If you're able to build your project on your development machine, but you're having trouble building it on Azure Pipelines or TFS, explore the following potential causes and corrective actions:

::: moniker range="vsts"
* We don't install prerelease versions of the .NET Core SDK on Microsoft-hosted agents. After a new version of the .NET Core SDK is released, 
it can take a few weeks for us to roll it out to all the datacenters that Azure Pipelines runs on. You don't have to wait for us to finish 
this rollout. You can use the **.NET Core Tool Installer**, as explained in this guidance, to install the desired version of the .NET Core SDK 
on Microsoft-hosted agents.  

::: moniker-end

* Check that the versions of the .NET Core SDK and runtime on your development machine match those on the agent. 
You can include a command-line script `dotnet --version` in your pipeline to print the version of the .NET Core SDK. 
Either use the **.NET Core Tool Installer**, as explained in this guidance, to deploy the same version on the agent, 
or update your projects and development machine to the newer version of the .NET Core SDK.

* You might be using some logic in the Visual Studio IDE that isn't encoded in your pipeline. 
Azure Pipelines or TFS runs each of the commands you specify in the tasks one after the other in a new process. 
Look at the logs from the Azure Pipelines or TFS build to see the exact commands that ran as part of the build. 
Repeat the same commands in the same order on your development machine to locate the problem.

* If you have a mixed solution that includes some .NET Core projects and some .NET Framework projects, 
you should also use the **NuGet** task to restore packages specified in `package.json` files. 
Similarly, you should add **MSBuild** or **Visual Studio Build** tasks to build the .NET Framework projects.

* If your builds fail intermittently while restoring packages, either NuGet.org is having issues, or there are 
networking problems between the Azure datacenter and NuGet.org. These aren't under our control, and you might 
need to explore whether using Azure Artifacts with NuGet.org as an upstream source improves the reliability of your builds.

* Occasionally, when we roll out an update to the hosted images with a new version of the .NET Core SDK or Visual Studio, 
something might break your build. This can happen, for example, if a newer version or feature of the NuGet tool 
is shipped with the SDK. To isolate these problems, use the **.NET Core Tool Installer** task to specify the version 
of the .NET Core SDK that's used in your build.
