## Example

This example shows how to build a Docker image and push it to a registry.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

1. To start, complete the steps from the example section in one of the following languages:
   * [.NET Core](dotnet-core.md)
   * [JavaScript](javascript.md)
   * [Python](python.md)

  The sample repos include a `Dockerfile` at the root of the repository. You must first have a working build pipeline before continuing on.

1. Define two variables in your build pipeline in the web UI.
   * **dockerId:** Your Docker Id for DockerHub or the admin user name for the Azure Container Registry
   * **dockerPassword:** Password for DockerHub or admin password for Azure Container Registry

  If you use Azure container registry, then make sure that you have [pre-created the registry in Azure portal](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal). You can get the admin user name and password from the **Access keys** section of the registry in Azure portal.

1. If you have a Docker Hub account, and would like to push the image to your **Docker Hub registry**, then use the web UI to change the YAML file in build pipeline from `azure-pipelines.yml` to `azure-pipelines.docker.yml`. This file is present at the root of your sample repository.

1. If you set up an **Azure container registry** and would like to push the image to that registry, then use the web UI to change the YAML file in build pipeline from `azure-pipelines.yml` to `azure-pipelines.acr.yml`. This file is present at the root of your sample repository.

1. Queue a new build and watch it create and push a Docker image to registry.

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario works on TFS, but some of the following instructions might not exactly match the version of TFS that you are using. Also, you'll need to set up a self-hosted agent, possibly also installing software. If you are a new user, you might have a better learning experience by trying this procedure out first using a free Azure DevOps organization. Then change the selector in the upper-left corner of this page from Team Foundation Server to **Azure DevOps**.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vsts"

1. To start, complete the steps from the example section in one of the following:

   * [.NET Core](dotnet-core.md)
   * [JavaScript](javascript.md)

  You must first have a working build pipeline following the above instructions before you proceed to the next steps.

1. If you follow the [.NET Core](dotnet-core.md), modify the **.NET Core Publish** task in the build pipeline as follows:
  * **Arguments:** `--configuration $(BuildConfiguration) --output out`
  * **Zip published projects:** Clear this check box
  * **Add project name to publish path:** Clear this check box

1. Remove any **Publish artifact** task from your pipeline. Since we are publishing a Docker image, there is no need to publish the build output to Azure Pipelines or TFS.

1. Add **Bash** task at the end of the pipeline and configure it as follows to build and publish an image using the **Dockerfile** in the repository:
   * **Type:** `Inline`
   * **Script:**

    To push to Docker Hub, use the following script:

    ```Bash
    docker build -t $(dockerId)/$(imageName) .
    docker login -u $(dockerId) -p $(dockerPassword)
    docker push $(dockerId)/$(imageName)
    ```

    To push to Azure container registry, use the following script:

    ```Bash
    docker build -t $(dockerId).azurecr.io/$(imageName) .
    docker login -u $(dockerId) -p $(dockerPassword) $(dockerId).azurecr.io
    docker push $(dockerId).azurecr.io/$(imageName)
    ```

1. In the **Variables** tab of the build pipeline, define two variables:
   * **imageName:** `$(Build.DefinitionName).$(Build.BuildId)`
   * **dockerId:** Your Docker Id.
   * **dockerPassword:** Your Docker password. Mark this variable as a secret variable.

   If you use Azure container registry, then make sure that you have [pre-created the registry in Azure portal](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal). You can get the user id and password from the **Access keys** section of the registry in Azure portal.

Save the pipeline and queue a build to see it in action.

Now that you've run a Docker build pipeline, you're ready to learn some of the more common changes people make to customize their Docker build.

## Build environment

::: moniker range="vsts"

You can use Azure Pipelines to build and push your Docker images without needing to set up any infrastructure of your own. You can build either Windows or Linux container images. The [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) in Azure Pipelines have Docker pre-installed on them. We frequently update the version of Docker on these agent machines. To know which version of Docker is installed, see [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md).

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file to select the appropriate agent pool:

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu-16.04' # other options: 'macOS-10.13', 'VS2017-Win2016'
```

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

In the build pipeline, select **Tasks**, then select the **Pipeline** node, and finally select the **Agent pool** that you want to use.

---

### Microsoft-hosted Linux agents

When you use the Microsoft-hosted Linux agents, you get a fresh Linux virtual machine with each build. This virtual machine runs the [agent](../agents/agents.md) and acts as a Docker host.

### Microsoft-hosted VS2017 (Windows) agents

Use the Windows agents (**win2016-vs2017** image if you use YAML, **Hosted VS2017** if you use the designer) to build Windows container images. When you use this pool, you get a fresh Windows Server 2016 virtual machine with each build. The virtual machine runs the [agent](../agents/agents.md) and acts as a Docker host. Some of the common images such as `microsoft/dotnet-framework`, `microsoft/aspnet`, `microsoft/aspnetcore-build`, `microsoft/windowsservercore`, and `microsoft/nanoserver` are pre-cached on this Docker host. Building new images from these images will therefore be faster.

> [!NOTE]
> * Using Windows agents, you can only build Docker images with Windows Server 2016 as the container OS. You cannot build Docker images with Windows Server 1803 as the container OS since the host operating system on the virtual machines is Windows Server 2016.
> * We don't yet have a pool of Microsoft-hosted agents running Windows Server 1803. Until this is available, you can build Windows Server 1803 images using self-hosted agents.

### Microsoft-hosted MacOS agents

You cannot use macOS agents to build container images as Docker is not installed on these agents.

### Self-hosted agents

As an alternative to using Microsoft-hosted agents, you can set up [self-hosted agents](../agents/agents.md#install) with Docker installed. This is particularly useful if you want to cache additional images on the Docker host, and further improve the performance of your builds.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

Your builds run on a [self-hosted agent](../agents/agents.md#install). Make sure that you have Docker installed on the agent.

::: moniker-end

## Build an image

You can build a Docker image by running the `docker build` command in a script or by using the [**Docker task**](../tasks/build/docker.md).

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

To run the command in a script, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

```yaml
- script: docker build -t $(dockerId)/$(imageName) .  # add options to this command to meet your needs
```

You can run any docker commands as part of the script block in your YAML file. If your Dockerfile depends on another image from a protected registry, you have to first run a `docker login` command in your script.
The [**Docker task**](../tasks/build/docker.md) which uses service connection for 'docker login' can be used in case you want to avoid managing username and password as secret. Plus, once you have used the [Docker task](../tasks/build/docker.md) to login, the session is maintained for the duration of the job thus allowing you to use follow-up tasks to execute any scripts .

```yaml
- script: docker login -u $(dockerId) -p $(pswd) <docker-registry-url>
```

Make sure that you define the Docker password as a [secret variable](../process/variables.md) in the build pipeline and not in the YAML file.

You don't need to specify `docker-registry-url` in the `login` command, if you are connecting to Docker Hub.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"
YAML builds are not yet available on TFS.
::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)


1. Select **Tasks** in your build pipeline, and then add the [**Docker task**](../tasks/build/docker.md) to the job.
> [!NOTE]
> The [Docker task](../tasks/build/docker.md) supports:
> * Docker best practices: By writing minimal yaml you can build and push an image which is tagged and labelled with rich metadata (for example, build, commit etc.)
> * Docker standards: Work with private registry like Azure Container Registry (ACR) easily by tagging and naming image with the registry hostname and port. The task helps you to follow Docker naming convention, for example, converting upper case character to lower case and removes spaces in image name.
> * Secret management: The Task makes it easy to use a Service Connection for connecting to any private container registry. For example, in case of ACR this helps you avoid enabling 'admin user' and subsequently managing username and password as secret. 
> Plus, once you have used the [Docker task](../tasks/build/docker.md) to login, the session is maintained for the duration of the job thus allowing you to use follow-up tasks to execute any scripts which use the login done by the Docker task. 


1. Select the task, and then for **Action**, select **Build an image**.

1. Specify the connection to the registry that you plan to push the image to by selecting the **Container registry type** - `Container Registry` or `Azure Container Registry`. Then enter the properties for that connection type. If you plan to push the image to an Azure Container Registry, make sure that you [pre-create the registry in Azure portal](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal).

## Integrate build and test tasks

Often you'll want to build and test your app before creating the Docker image. You can orchestrate this process either in your build pipeline or in your _Dockerfile_.

### Build and test in your build pipeline

In this approach, you use the build pipeline to orchestrate building your code, running your tests, and creating an image. This approach is useful if you want to:

* Leverage tasks (either built-in tasks or those you get from the Marketplace) to define the pipeline used to build and test your app.
* Run tasks that require authentication via service connections (for example: authenticated NuGet or npm feeds).
* Publish test results.

To create an image, you run a `docker build` command at the end of your build pipeline. Your _Dockerfile_ contains the instructions to copy the results of your build into the container.

The instructions in the [above example](#example) demonstrate this approach. The test results published in the example, can be viewed under [Tests Tab](../test/review-continuous-test-results-after-build.md) in build.

### Build and test in your Dockerfile

In this approach, you use your _Dockerfile_ to build your code and run tests. The build pipeline has a single step to run `docker build`. The rest of the steps are orchestrated by the Docker build process. It's common to use a [multi-stage Docker build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) in this approach. The advantage of this approach is that your build process is entirely configured in your _Dockerfile_. This means your build process is portable from the development machine to any build system. One disadvantage is that you can't leverage Azure Pipelines and TFS features such as tasks, jobs, or test reporting.

For an example on using this approach, follow these steps:

1. The sample repos that you used in the [example](#example) above also include a **Dockerfile.multistage** for this approach:

    * [Dockerfile.multistage in .NET Core sample](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-dotnet-core/blob/master/docs/Dockerfile.multistage)
    * [Dockerfile.multistage in JavaScript sample](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-javascript/blob/master/docs/Dockerfile.multistage)

  Replace the content in the `Dockerfile` at the root of your repository with the content from `Dockerfile.multistage`.

1. Then, define your build pipeline:

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

Replace the contents in the `azure-pipelines.yml` file at the root of your repo with the following content:

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu-16.04'

steps:
  - script: docker build -t $(dockerId)/$(dockerImage) . # include other options to meet your needs
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"
YAML builds are not yet available on TFS.
::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

1. Select **Tasks** in the build pipeline, and then remove all the tasks.

1. Add a [**Docker task**](../tasks/build/docker.md), and then for **Action** select **Build an image**.

---

## Push an image

Once you've built a Docker image, you can push it to a Docker registry or to Azure Container Registry (ACR). You can do this using either `docker push` command or using `Docker` task. The [**Docker task**](../tasks/build/docker.md) makes the process easier for you because it sets up an authenticated connection to your registry or ACR.

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

To push the image to Docker hub, add the following snippet to the `azure-pipelines.yml` file at the root of your repo:

```yaml
- script: |
    docker login -u $(dockerId) -p $(pswd)
    docker push $(dockerId)/$(imageName)
```

To push the image to Azure Container Registry, use the following snippet:

```yaml
- script: |
    docker login -u $(dockerId) -p $(pswd) $(dockerId).azurecr.io
    docker push $(dockerId).azurecr.io/$(imageName)
```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"
YAML builds are not yet available on TFS.
::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

1. In your build pipeline, select **Tasks**, and then add a [**Docker task**](../tasks/build/docker.md) to the job that runs your build tasks.

1. Select the **Docker** task, and then for **Action** select **Push an image**.

1. Specify how to connect to your registry in the **Container registry type** and the corresponding service connection properties.

---

## Use Docker Compose

Docker Compose enables you to bring up multiple containers and run tests.
For example, you can use a _docker-compose.yml_ file to define two containers that need to work together to test your application: a web service that contains your application and a test driver.
You can build new container images every time you push a change to your code.
You can wait for the test driver to finish running tests before bringing down the two containers.

::: moniker range="vsts"

If you use Microsoft-hosted agents, you don't have to run any additional steps to install and use docker-compose.

::: moniker-end

To extend the [above example](#example) to use docker-compose:

1. Your sample repo already includes a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `docs` folder.
    
1. Add a **Bash** step to your build pipeline:

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"
Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

```yaml
- script: |
    docker-compose -f docs/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . -p docs up -d
    docker wait docs_sut_1
    docker-compose -f docs/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"
YAML builds are not yet available on TFS.
::: moniker-end

# [Designer](#tab/designer)

In the build pipeline, add a **Bash** task with the following inline script:

```bash
docker-compose -f docs/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . -p docs up -d
docker wait docs_sut_1
docker-compose -f docs/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . down
```
---

::: moniker range="vsts"
> [!NOTE]
> When using agents in the Hosted Linux Preview pool, the agent runs inside a container. The network of this container is not bridged to the network of the containers that you spin up through docker compose. As a result, you cannot communicate from the agent to one of the containers in the composition, for example, to drive tests. The preferred workaround is to upgrade to the _Hosted Ubuntu 1604_ pool, where the agents do not run inside a container.

If you can't upgrade, another way to solve this problem is to explicitly create another test driver as a container within the composition, as we did in the example above. Another solution is to use `docker-compose exec` and target a specific container in the composition from your script.

## Build ARM containers

When you use Microsoft-hosted Linux agents, you create Linux container images for the x64 architecture. To create images for other architectures (for example, x86, ARM, and so on), you can use a machine emulator such as [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/). The following steps illustrate how to create an ARM container image:

1. Author your _Dockerfile_ so that an Intel binary of QEMU exists in the base Docker image. For example, the Raspbian Docker image from [Resin](https://resin.io/) already has this.

 ```Dockerfile
FROM resin/rpi-raspbian
```

1. Run the following script in your build pipeline.

 ```Dockerfile
# register QEMU binary - this can be done by running the following Docker image
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
# build your image
docker build -t $(dockerId)/$(imageName) .
```

:::moniker-end

<a name="troubleshooting"></a>
## Troubleshooting

::: moniker range="vsts"

If you're able to build your image on your development machine, but are having trouble building it on Azure Pipelines or TFS, the following solutions might help:

* Check that you are using the correct type of agents - Microsoft-hosted Linux or Microsoft-hosted Windows - to mimic the type of container images you build on your development machine.

* If you use Microsoft-hosted agents to run your builds, the Docker images are not cached from build to build since you get a new machine for every build. This will make your builds on Microsoft-hosted agents run longer than those on your development machine.

* If you use agents from the Hosted Linux Preview pool, then the agent itself runs in a container. This has some implications when you use docker-compose to spin up additional containers. As an example, there is no network connectivity from the agent container to the composition containers. Use `docker-compose exec` as a way of executing commands from the agent container in one of the composition containers. Also, you should upgrade those builds to use the _Hosted Ubuntu 1604_ pool, where the agents do not run in containers.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< vsts"

If you're able to build your image on your development machine, but are having trouble building it on Azure Pipelines or TFS, then check the version of Docker on the agent, and ensure that it matches what you have on your development machine. You can include a command line script `docker --version` in your build pipeline to print the version of Docker.

::: moniker-end
