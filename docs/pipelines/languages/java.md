# Build Java apps in Azure Pipelines

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**

This guidance explains how to use Azure Pipelines or Team Foundation Server (TFS) to automatically build Java projects with CI/CD pipelines. See [Android](android.md) for Android-specific projects.

## Example

To get started using a sample Java project, fork this repository in GitHub, or import it into Azure Repos or TFS:

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-java
```

The sample code includes an `azure-pipelines.yml` file at the root of the repository. You can use this file to build the project.

Follow instructions in [Create your first pipeline](../get-started-yaml.md) to create a build pipeline for the sample project.

The rest of this topic describes ways to customize your Java build pipeline.

## Choose an agent

You can use Azure Pipelines to build your Java projects on [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) that include modern JDKs and other tools for Java. Or, you can use [self-hosted agents](../agents/agents.md#install) with specific tools that you need.

Create a file named **azure-pipelines.yml** in the root of your repository. Then, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file to select the appropriate agent pool:

```yaml
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/java
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04' # Other options: 'macOS-10.13', 'vs2017-win2016'
```

## Build your code with Maven

To build with Maven, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Change values, such as the path to your `pom.xml` file, to match your project configuration. See the [Maven](../tasks/build/maven.md) task for more about these options.

```yaml
steps:
- task: Maven@3
  inputs:
    mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
    mavenOptions: '-Xmx3072m'
    javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
    jdkVersionOption: '1.11'
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'
    publishJUnitResults: false
    testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
    goals: 'package'
```

### Customize Maven

#### Customize the build path

Adjust the `mavenPomFile` value if your `pom.xml` file isn't in the root of the repository. The file path value should be relative to the root of the repository, such as `IdentityService/pom.xml` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/IdentityService/pom.xml`.

#### Customize Maven goals

Set the **goals** value to a space-separated list of goals for Maven to execute, such as `clean package`.

For details about common Java phases and goals, see [Apache's Maven documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).

## Build your code with Gradle

To build with Gradle, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. See the [Gradle](../tasks/build/gradle.md) task for more about these options.

```yaml
steps:
- task: Gradle@2
  inputs:
    workingDirectory: ''
    gradleWrapperFile: 'gradlew'
    gradleOptions: '-Xmx3072m'
    javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
    jdkVersionOption: '1.11'
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'
    publishJUnitResults: false
    testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
    tasks: 'build'
```

### Customize Gradle

#### Choose the version of Gradle

The version of Gradle installed on the agent machine will be used unless your repository's `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file has a `distributionUrl` property that specifies a different Gradle version to download and use during the build.

#### Adjust the build path

Adjust the `workingDirectory` value if your `gradlew` file isn't in the root of the repository.
The directory value should be relative to the root of the repository, such as `IdentityService` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/IdentityService`.

Adjust the `gradleWrapperFile` value if your `gradlew` file isn't in the root of the repository. The file path value should be relative to the root of the repository, such as `IdentityService/gradlew` or `$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/IdentityService/gradlew`.

#### Adjust Gradle tasks

Adjust the **tasks** value for the tasks that Gradle should execute, such as `build` or `check`.

For details about common Java Plugin tasks for Gradle, see [Gradle's documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_tasks).

## Build your code with Ant

To build with Ant, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Change values, such as the path to your `build.xml` file, to match your project configuration. See the [Ant](../tasks/build/ant.md) task for more about these options.

```yaml
steps:
- task: Ant@1
  inputs:
    workingDirectory: ''
    buildFile: 'build.xml'
    javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
    jdkVersionOption: '1.11'
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'
    publishJUnitResults: false
    testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
```

## Build your code using a command line or script

To build with a command line or script, add one of the following snippets to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

### Inline script

The `script:` step runs an inline script using Bash on Linux and macOS and Command Prompt on Windows. For details, see the [Bash](../tasks/utility/bash.md) or [Command line](../tasks/utility/powershell.md) task.

```yaml
steps:
- script: |
    echo Starting the build
    mvn package
  displayName: 'Build with Maven'
```

### Script file

This snippet runs a script file that is in your repository. For details, see the [Shell Script](../tasks/utility/shell-script.md), [Batch script](../tasks/utility/batch-script.md), or [PowerShell](../tasks/utility/powershell.md) task.

```YAML
steps:
- task: ShellScript@2
  inputs:
    scriptPath: 'build.sh'
```
