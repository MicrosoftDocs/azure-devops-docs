# Build and test Go projects with Azure Pipelines

**Azure Pipelines**

This guidance explains how to use Azure Pipelines to automatically build and test Go projects with CI/CD pipelines.

## Example

To get started using a sample Go project, fork this repository in GitHub, or import it into Azure Repos or TFS:

```
https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/pipelines-go
```

The sample code includes an `azure-pipelines.yml` file at the root of the repository. You can use this file to build the app.

Follow instructions in [Create your first pipeline](../get-started-yaml.md) to create a build pipeline for the sample project.

The rest of this topic describes ways to customize your Go build pipeline.

## Build environment

You can use Azure Pipelines to build your Go projects without needing to set up any infrastructure of your own. Modern versions of Go are preinstalled on [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md) in Azure Pipelines. You can use Linux, macOS, or Windows agents to run your builds.

For the exact versions of Go that are preinstalled, refer to [Microsoft-hosted agents](../agents/hosted.md#software).

Create a file named **azure-pipelines.yml** in the root of your repository. Then, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file to select the appropriate agent pool:

```yaml
# https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/go
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-16.04' # Other options: 'macOS-10.13', 'vs2017-win2016'
```

## Set up a Go workspace

As the Go documentation [describes](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces), a Go workspace consists of a root directory to which the `$GOPATH` environment variable points. Within that directory are standard subdirectories:

* `bin` to contain executable commands
* `pkg` to contain compiled packages (`.a` files)
* `src` to contain Go source files (`.go`, `.c`, `.g`, `.s`)

When an Azure Pipelines build fetches code from a remote repository, it places the code in the default working directory of the build. This doesn't match the expected structure of a Go workspace. To address this, add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Note: this script runs in bash on Linux and macOS agents, but must be modified for Windows.

```yaml
variables:
  GOBIN:  '$(GOPATH)/bin' # Go binaries path
  GOROOT: '/usr/local/go1.11' # Go installation path
  GOPATH: '$(system.defaultWorkingDirectory)/gopath' # Go workspace path
  modulePath: '$(GOPATH)/src/github.com/$(build.repository.name)' # Path to the module's code

steps:
- script: |
    mkdir -p '$(GOBIN)'
    mkdir -p '$(GOPATH)/pkg'
    mkdir -p '$(modulePath)'
    shopt -s extglob
    mv !(gopath) '$(modulePath)'
    echo '##vso[task.prependpath]$(GOBIN)'
    echo '##vso[task.prependpath]$(GOROOT)/bin'
  displayName: 'Set up the Go workspace'
```

If your code is not in GitHub, change the `modulePath` variable's use of `github.com` to an appropriate value for your module.

This snippet does the following:

1. Sets `$GOROOT` to the version of Go that should be used.
2. Sets other well-known Go environment variables to their proper values.
3. Creates a Go workspace in a subdirectory named `gopath` with child directories `bin`, `pkg`, and `src`.
4. Moves code that was fetched from the remote repository into the workspace's `src` directory
5. Adds the version of Go and the workspace's `bin` directory to the path.

## Install dependencies

### go get

Use `go get` to download the source code for a Go project or to install a tool into the Go workspace. Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- script: go get -v -t -d ./...
  workingDirectory: '$(modulePath)'
  displayName: 'go get dependencies'
```

### dep ensure

Use `dep ensure` if your project uses dep to download dependencies imported in your code. Running `dep ensure` clones imported repositories into your project's vendor directory. Its `Gopkg.lock` and `Gopkg.toml` files guarantee that everyone working on the project uses the same version of dependencies as your build. Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file. Note: this script runs in bash on Linux and macOS agents, but must be modified for Windows.

```yaml
- script: |
    if [ -f Gopkg.toml ]; then
        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
        dep ensure
    fi
  workingDirectory: '$(modulePath)'
  displayName: 'Download dep and run `dep ensure`'
```

## Test

Use `go test` to test your go module and its subdirectories (`./...`). Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- script: go test -v ./...
  workingDirectory: '$(modulePath)'
  displayName: 'Run tests'
```

## Build

Use `go build` to build your Go project. Add the following snippet to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

```yaml
- script: go build -v .
  workingDirectory: '$(modulePath)'
  displayName: 'Build'
```

## Build a container image

You can also build and publish a Docker container image for your app. For more information, see [Docker](docker.md).
