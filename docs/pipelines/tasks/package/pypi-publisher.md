# Package: PyPI Publisher task (deprecated)

**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to create and upload an sdist or wheel to a PyPI-compatible index using Twine.

This task builds an sdist package by running `python setup.py sdist` using the Python instance in `PATH`.
It can optionally build a universal wheel in addition to the sdist.
Then, it will upload the package to a PyPI index using `twine`.
The task will install the `wheel` and `twine` packages with `python -m pip install --user`.

## Deprecated

> [!WARNING]
> The PyPI Publisher task has been deprecated. You can now [publish PyPI packages using twine authentication and custom scripts](../../targets/pypi.md). 

## Demands

None

## Prerequisites
A generic service connection for a PyPI index.

> [!TIP]
> To configure a new generic service connection, go to Settings -> Services -> New service connection -> Generic.
> * **Connection Name**: A friendly connection name of your choice
> * **Server URL**: PyPI package server (for example: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/)
> * **User name**: username for your PyPI account
> * **Password/Token Key**: password for your PyPI account
