# Package: PyPI Publisher

**VSTS**

![icon](_img/pypi-publisher.png) Create and upload an sdist or wheel to a PyPI-compatible index using Twine.

This task builds an sdist package by running `python setup.py sdist` using the Python instance in `PATH`.
It can optionally build a universal wheel in addition to the sdist.
Then, it will upload the package to a PyPI index using `twine`.
The task will install the `wheel` and `twine` packages with `python -m pip install --user`.

## Demands

## Prerequisites
A generic service connection for a PyPI index.

> [!TIP]
