# Use Python Version task

**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to select a version of Python to run on an agent, and optionally add it to PATH.

## Demands

None

## Prerequisites

* A [Microsoft-hosted agent](../../agents/hosted.md#software) with side-by-side versions of Python installed, or a self-hosted agent with Agent.ToolsDirectory configured (see [Q&A](#how-can-i-configure-a-self-hosted-agent-to-use-this-task)).

This task will fail if no Python versions are found in Agent.ToolsDirectory. Available Python versions on Microsoft-hosted agents can be found [here](../../agents/hosted.md#software).

> [!Note]
> x86 and x64 versions of Python are available on Microsoft-hosted Windows agents, but not on Linux or macOS agents.

::: moniker range="> tfs-2018"

## YAML snippet

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/yaml/UsePythonVersionV0.md)]

::: moniker-end

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Version spec | Version range or exact version of a Python version to use. | 3.x |
| Add to PATH | Whether to prepend the retrieved Python version to the PATH environment variable to make it available in subsequent tasks or scripts without using the output variable. | true |
| Advanced - Architecture | The target architecture (x86, x64) of the Python interpreter. x86 is supported only on Windows. | x64 |

::: moniker range="> azure-devops-2019"

As of version 0.150 of the task, version spec will also accept `pypy2` or `pypy3`.

::: moniker-end

If the task completes successfully, the task's output variable will contain the directory of the Python installation:

![output variable](media/use_python_version_output_variable.png)

## Remarks

After running this task with "Add to PATH," the `python` command in subsequent scripts will be for the highest available version of the interpreter matching the version spec and architecture.

The versions of Python installed on the Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu and macOS images follow the symlinking structure for Unix-like systems defined in [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/).
For example, for Python 3.7, `python3.7` is the actual interpreter.
`python3` is symlinked to that interpreter, and `python` is a symlink to that symlink.

On the Microsoft-hosted Windows images, the interpreter is just `python`.

For Microsoft-hosted agents, x86 is supported only on Windows.
This is because Windows can run executables compiled for the x86 architecture with the WoW64 subsystem.
Hosted Ubuntu and Hosted macOS run 64-bit operating systems and run only 64-bit Python.

## Open source

This task is open source [on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks). Feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Q & A
<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### Where can I learn more about tool installers?

For an explanation of tool installers and examples, see [Tool installers](../../process/tasks.md#tool-installers).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/qa-agents.md)]

### How can I configure a self-hosted agent to use this task?

The desired Python version will have to be added to the tool cache on the self-hosted agent in order for the task to use it. Normally the tool cache is located under the `_work/_tool` directory of the agent or the path can be overridden by the environment variable `AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY`. Under that directory, create the following directory structure based off of your Python version:

```
$AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY/
    Python/
        {version number}/
            {platform}/
                {tool files}
            {platform}.complete
```

The `version number` should follow the format of `1.2.3`. 
The `platform` should either be `x86` or `x64`.
The `tool files` should be the unzipped Python version files.
The `{platform}.complete` should be a 0 byte file that looks like `x86.complete` or `x64.complete` and just signifies the tool has been installed in the cache properly.

As a complete, concrete example, here is how a completed download of Python 3.6.4 for x64 would look in the tool cache:

```
$AGENT_TOOLSDIRECTORY/
    Python/
        3.6.4/
            x64/
                {tool files}
            x64.complete
```

For more details on the tool cache, look [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-task-tool-lib/blob/master/docs/overview.md#tool-cache).

In order that your scripts may work as they would on Microsoft-hosted agents, we recommend following the symlinking structure from [PEP 394](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/) on Unix-like systems.
