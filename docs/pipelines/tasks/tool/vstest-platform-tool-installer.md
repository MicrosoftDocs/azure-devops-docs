# Visual Studio Test Platform Installer task

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Use this task to acquire the [Microsoft test platform](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TestPlatform/)
from nuget.org or a specified feed, and add it to the tools cache. The installer task satisfies the 'vstest'
demand and a subsequent [Visual Studio Test task](../test/vstest.md)
in a build or release pipeline can run without needing a full Visual Studio install on the agent machine.
