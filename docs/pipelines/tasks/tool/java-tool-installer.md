# Java Tool Installer task

**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to acquire a specific version of Java from a user supplied Azure blob,
from a location in the source or on the agent, or from the tools cache. The task also sets the JAVA_HOME environment variable.
Use this task to change the version of Java used in Java tasks.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| JDK Version | Specify which JDK version to download and use. |
| JDK Architecture | Specify the bit version of the JDK. |
| JDK source | Specify the source for the compressed JDK, either Azure blob storage or a local directory on the agent or source repository. |
| JDK file | Applicable when JDK is located in a local directory. Specify the path to the folder that contains the compressed JDK. The path could be in your source repository or a local path on the agent.|
| Azure Subscription | Applicable when the JDK is located in Azure Blob storage. Specify the Azure Resource Manager subscription for the JDK.|
| Storage Account Name | Applicable when the JDK is located in Azure Blob storage. Specify the Storage account name in which the JDK is located. Azure Classic and Resource Manager storage accounts are listed. |
| Container Name | Applicable when the JDK is located in Azure Blob storage. Specify the name of the container in the storage account in which the JDK is located.|
| Common Virtual Path | Applicable when the JDK is located in Azure Blob storage. Specify the path to the JDK inside the Azure storage container. |
| Destination directory | Specify the destination directory into which the JDK should be extracted. |
| Clean destination directory | Select this option to clean the destination directory before the JDK is extracted into it. |
| Control options | See [Control options](../../process/tasks.md#controloptions). |

## Examples

Here's an example of getting the archive file from a local directory on Linux.
The file should be an archive (.zip, .gz) of the `JAVA_HOME` directory so that it includes the `bin`, `lib`, `include`, `jre`, etc. directories.

```yaml
  - task: JavaToolInstaller@0
    inputs:
      versionSpec: "11"
      jdkArchitectureOption: x64
      jdkSourceOption: LocalDirectory
      jdkFile: "/builds/openjdk-11.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz"
      jdkDestinationDirectory: "/builds/binaries/externals"
      cleanDestinationDirectory: true
```

Here's an example of downloading the archive file from Azure Storage.
The file should be an archive (.zip, .gz) of the `JAVA_HOME` directory so that it includes the `bin`, `lib`, `include`, `jre`, etc. directories.

```yaml
- task: JavaToolInstaller@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '6'
    jdkArchitectureOption: 'x64'
    jdkSourceOption: AzureStorage
    azureResourceManagerEndpoint: myARMServiceConnection
    azureStorageAccountName: myAzureStorageAccountName
    azureContainerName: myAzureStorageContainerName
    azureCommonVirtualFile: 'jdk1.6.0_45.zip'
    jdkDestinationDirectory: '$(agent.toolsDirectory)/jdk6'
    cleanDestinationDirectory: false
```
