## Arguments

|Argument|Description|
|--- |--- |
|`versionSpec`<br/>Version Spec| A version or version range that specifies the NuGet version to make available on the path. Use x as a wildcard. See the [list of available NuGet versions](http://dist.nuget.org/tools.json). If you want to match a pre-release version, the specification must contain a major, minor, patch, and pre-release version from the list above. Examples: 5.x, 5.4.x, 5.3.1, >=5.0.0-0. If unspecified, a version will be chosen automatically|
|`checkLatest`<br/> Always check for new versions| Always check for and download the latest available version of `NuGet.exe` which satisfies the version spec. Enabling this option could cause unexpected build breaks when a new version of NuGet is released|

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [the Microsoft-hosted agents](../../agents/hosted.md), you should leave this check box cleared. We update the Microsoft-hosted agents on a regular basis, but they're often slightly behind the latest version. So selecting this box will result in your build spending a lot of time updating to a newer minor version.
