# Android build task (deprecated; use Gradle)

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Use this task to build an Android app using Gradle and optionally start the emulator for unit tests.

## Deprecated

**The AndroidBuild@1 task has been deprecated. Use the [Gradle](gradle.md) task instead.**
