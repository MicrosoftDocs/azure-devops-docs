# Docker task

**Azure Pipelines | TFS 2018**

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to build, tag, push, or run Docker images, or run a Docker command. This task can be used with Docker or Azure Container registry.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> For YAML pipelines, consider using script-based Docker commands as described in the [Docker guidance](../../languages/docker.md), and using this Docker task when working with container registries that require authentication.

The built-in Docker task enables you to build Docker images, push Docker images to an authenticated Docker registry,
run Docker images, or execute other operations offered by the Docker CLI:

* **Use Docker best practices**: By writing minimal yaml you can build and push an image which is tagged with '$(Build.BuildId)' and has rich metadata about the repository, commit, build information to the container image as Docker labels
* **Conform to Docker standards**: The task takes care of details like tagging image with the registry hostname and port image before pushing the image to a private registry like Azure Container Registry (ACR). It also helps you to follow Docker naming convention, for example, converting upper case character to lower case and removes spaces in 
  image name which can happen if you are using $(Build.Repository.Name) to name your images.
* **Manage secrets**: The task makes it easy to use either 'Docker registry service connection' for connecting to any private container registry or 'Azure Service Connection' For connecting to ACR. For example, in case of ACR you don't have to enable 'admin user' and manage username and password as secret. The task will use the Azure Service connection to login to ACR.
  Once you have used the Docker task to sign in, the session is maintained for the duration of the job thus allowing  you to use follow-up tasks to execute any scripts by leveraging the login done by the Docker task. 
  For example, You can use the Docker task to sign into ACR and then use a subsequent script to pull an image and scan the container image for vulnerabilities.

## YAML snippet
### Build Docker images
Build a Dockerfile into an image with a registry-qualified name and multiple tags such as the build ID, source branch name and Git tags:
```yaml
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: 'Build an image'
  inputs:
    azureSubscriptionEndpoint: 'ContosoAzureSubscription'
    azureContainerRegistry: contoso.azurecr.io
```
For other private container registries
```yaml
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: 'Build an image'
  inputs:
    containerregistrytype: 'Container Registry'
    dockerRegistryEndpoint: Contoso
```
'azureSubscriptionEndpoint' input is the name of Azure Service Connection. See [Azure Resource Manager service connection](../../library/connect-to-azure.md) to manually set up the connection.
'dockerRegistryEndpoint' input is the name of [Docker Registry service connection](../../library/service-endpoints.md).

This will result in a docker login to the container registry by using the service connection and then a docker build command will be used to build and tag the image. For example, a simplified version of the command run is:
> docker build -t contoso.azurecr.io/contoso-ci:11 .

By writing minimal yaml you can build and push an image which is tagged with '$(Build.BuildId)' and has rich metadata about the repository, commit, build information to the container image as Docker labels.
The task takes care of details like tagging image with the registry hostname and port image before pushing the image to a private registry like Azure Container Registry (ACR). It also helps you to follow Docker naming convention, for example, converting upper case character to lower case and removes spaces in 
image name which can happen if you are using $(Build.Repository.Name) to name your images.

### Push Docker images
Push Docker images with multiple tags to an authenticated Docker Registry and save the resulting repository image digest to a file:

```yaml
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: 'Push an image'
  inputs:
    azureSubscriptionEndpoint: 'ContosoAzureSubscription'
    azureContainerRegistry: contoso.azurecr.io
    command: 'push'
```
This will result in a docker login to the container registry by using the service connection and then a docker push command will be used to push the image to the container registry. For example, a simplified version of the command run is:
> docker push contoso.azurecr.io/contoso-ci:11

### Build, tag and push container image
Here is an end to end sample yaml for building, tagging and pushing container image.
```yaml
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: 'Build an image'
  inputs:
    imageName: 'contoso.azurecr.io/repositoryname:$(Build.BuildId)'
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: Login
  inputs:
    azureSubscriptionEndpoint: 'ContosoAzureSubscription'
    azureContainerRegistry: contoso.azurecr.io
    command: login
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: 'Push an image'
  inputs:
    command: 'push'
    imageName: 'contoso.azurecr.io/$repositoryname:$(Build.BuildId)'
```

### Login to a container registry and run scripts
Task makes it easy to use either 'Docker registry service connection' for connecting to any private container registry or 'Azure Service Connection' For connecting to ACR. For example, in the case of ACR you don't have to enable 'admin user' and manage username and password as secret. The task will use the Azure Service connection to login to ACR.
Once you have used the task to login, the session is maintained for the duration of the job thus allowing  you to use follow-up tasks to execute any scripts by leveraging the login done by the Docker task. 
For example, You can use the Docker task to sign into ACR and then use a subsequent script to pull an image and scan the container image for vulnerabilities.

```yaml
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: Login
  inputs:
    azureSubscriptionEndpoint: 'ContosoAzureSubscription'
    azureContainerRegistry: contoso.azurecr.io
    command: login
- bash: |
   # Write your commands here
   # Use the environment variables input below to pass secret variables to this script
   docker build -t contoso.azurecr.io/repositoryname:$(Build.BuildId) . # include other options to meet your needs
   docker push contoso.azurecr.io/repositoryname:$(Build.BuildId) 
   displayName: 'Build, tag and push image'
```

### Run Docker images
Perform isolated workloads inside a container by running a Docker image. A Docker image can also be run in the background with a specific restart policy.
```yaml
- task: Docker@1
  displayName: 'Push an image'
  inputs:
    azureSubscriptionEndpoint: 'ContosoAzureSubscription'
    azureContainerRegistry: contoso.azurecr.io
    command: 'run'
    containerName: contosocontainer
    ports: 8084
    volumes: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory):/src'
    workingDirectory: /src
    containerCommand: 'npm install'
    restartPolicy: onFailure
```
This will result in a docker run command. For example: 
> docker run -d --restart no atul-aks:1382
