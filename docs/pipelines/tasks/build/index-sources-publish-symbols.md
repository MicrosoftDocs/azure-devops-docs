# Index Sources & Publish Symbols task

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2015-rtm.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> A symbol server is available with Package Management in **Azure Artifacts** and works best with **Visual Studio 2017.4 and newer**.
> **Team Foundation Server** users and users without the Package Management extension can publish symbols to a file share using this task.

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to index your source code and optionally publish symbols to the Package Management symbol server or a file share.

Indexing source code enables you to use your .pdb symbol files to debug an app on a machine other than the one you used to build the app. For example, you can debug an app built by a build agent from a dev machine that does not have the source code.

Symbol servers enables your debugger to automatically retrieve the correct symbol files without knowing product names, build numbers or package names. To learn more about symbols, read the [concept page](/azure/devops/artifacts/concepts/symbols); to publish symbols, use this task and see [the walkthrough](/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/symbols).

> [!NOTE]
> This build task works only:
> 
> * For code in Git or TFVC stored in Team Foundation Server (TFS) or Azure Repos. It does not work for any other type of repository.

## Q & A
<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### How does indexing work?

By choosing to index the sources, an extra section will be injected into the PDB files. PDB files normally contain references to the local source file paths only. For example, ```C:\BuildAgent\_work\1\src\MyApp\Program.cs```. The extra section injected into the PDB file contains mapping instructions for debuggers. The mapping information indicates how to retrieve the server item corresponding to each local path.

 The Visual Studio debugger will use the mapping information to retrieve the source file from the server. An actual command to retrieve the source file is included in the mapping information. You may be prompted by Visual Studio whether to run the command. For example
```
tf.exe git view /collection:http://SERVER:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /teamproject:"93fc2e4d-0f0f-4e40-9825-01326191395d" /repository:"647ed0e6-43d2-4e3d-b8bf-2885476e9c44" /commitId:3a9910862e22f442cd56ff280b43dd544d1ee8c9 /path:"/MyApp/Program.cs" /output:"C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\SOURCE~1\TFS_COMMIT\3a991086\MyApp\Program.cs" /applyfilters
```

### Can I use source indexing on a portable PDB created from a .NET Core assembly?

No, source indexing is currently not enabled for Portable PDBs as SourceLink doesn't support authenticated source repositories. The workaround at the moment is to configure the build to generate full PDBs. Note that if you are generating a .NET Standard 2.0 assembly and are generating full PDBs and consuming them in a .NET Framework (full CLR) application then you will be able to fetch sources from Azure Repos (provided you have embedded SourceLink information and enabled it in your IDE).

### How long are Symbols retained?

When symbols are published to Azure Pipelines they are associated with a build. When the build is deleted either manually or due to retention policy then the symbols are also deleted. If you want to retain the symbols indefinitely then you should mark the build as Retain Indefinitely.
