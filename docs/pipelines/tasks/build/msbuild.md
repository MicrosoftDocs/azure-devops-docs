## FAQ
<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### Should I use the Visual Studio Build task or the MSBuild task?

If you are building a solution, in most cases you should use the [Visual Studio Build task](../build/visual-studio-build.md). This task automatically:

* Sets the ```/p:VisualStudioVersion``` property for you. This forces MSBuild to use a particular set of targets that increase the likelihood of a successful build.

* Specifies the MSBuild version argument.

In some cases, you might need to use the MSBuild task. For example, you should use it if you are building code projects apart from a solution.

### Where can I learn more about MSBuild?

### How do I build multiple configurations for multiple platforms?

<ol>
   <li>
      <p>
         On the Variables tab, make sure you&#39;ve got variables defined for your configurations and platforms. To specify multiple values, separate them with commas.
      </p>
      <p>For example, for a .NET app you could specify:</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr>
               <td>Name</td>
               <td>Value</td>
            </tr>
         </thead>
         <tr>
            <td>BuildConfiguration</td>
            <td>debug, release</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>BuildPlatform</td>
            <td>any cpu</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <p>For example, for a C++ app you could specify:</p>
      <table>
         <thead>
            <tr>
               <td>Name</td>
               <td>Value</td>
            </tr>
         </thead>
         <tr>
            <td>BuildConfiguration</td>
            <td>debug, release</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>BuildPlatform</td>
            <td>x86, x64</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>On the Options tab, select <strong>MultiConfiguration</strong> and specify the Multipliers, separated by commas. For example: <code>BuildConfiguration, BuildPlatform</code></p>
      <p>Select Parallel if you want to distribute the jobs (one for each combination of values) to multiple agents in parallel if they are available.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>On the Build tab, select this step and specify the Platform and Configuration arguments. For example:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Platform: <code>$(BuildPlatform)</code></li>
         <li>Configuration: <code>$(BuildConfiguration)</code></li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ol>

### Can I build TFSBuild.proj files?

You cannot build TFSBuild.proj files. These kinds of files are generated by TFS 2005 and 2008.  These files contain tasks and targets are supported only using [XAML builds](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/ms181709(v=vs.120)).

## Troubleshooting

This section provides troubleshooting tips for common issues that a user might encounter when using the MSBuild task.

* [Build failed with the following error: An internal failure occurred while running MSBuild](#build-failed-with-the-following-error-an-internal-failure-occurred-while-running-msbuild)

### Build failed with the following error: An internal failure occurred while running MSBuild

* [Possible causes](#possible-causes)
* [Troubleshooting suggestions](#troubleshooting-suggestions)

#### Possible causes

* Change in the MSBuild version.
* Issues with a third-party extension.
* New updates to Visual Studio that can cause missing assemblies on the build agent. 
* Moved or deleted some of the necessary NuGet packages.

#### Troubleshooting suggestions

* [Run the pipeline with diagnostics to retrieve detailed logs](#run-the-pipeline-with-diagnostics-to-retrieve-detailed-logs)
* [Try to reproduce the error locally](#try-to-reproduce-the-error-locally)
* [What else can I do?](#what-else-can-i-do)

##### Run the pipeline with diagnostics to retrieve detailed logs

One of the available options to diagnose the issue is to take a look at the generated logs. You can view your pipeline logs by selecting the appropriate task and job in your pipeline run summary. 

To get the logs of your pipeline execution [Get logs to diagnose problems](../../troubleshooting/review-logs.md)

You can also setup and download a customized verbose log to assist with your troubleshooting:

* [Configure verbose logs](../../troubleshooting/review-logs.md#configure-verbose-logs)
* [View and download logs](../../troubleshooting/review-logs.md#view-and-download-logs)

In addition to the pipeline diagnostic logs, you can also check these other types of logs that contain more information to help you debug and solve the problem:

* [Worker diagnostic logs](../../troubleshooting/review-logs.md#worker-diagnostic-logs)
* [Agent diagnostic logs](../../troubleshooting/review-logs.md#agent-diagnostic-logs)
* [Other logs](../../troubleshooting/review-logs.md#other-logs) (Environment and capabilities)

##### Try to reproduce the error locally

If you are using a hosted build agent, you might want to try to reproduce the error locally. This will help you to narrow down whether the failure is the result of the build agent or the build task.

Run the same MSBuild command on your local machine using the same arguments. Check out [MSBuild command](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference?view=vs-2019&preserve-view=true) for reference

> [!TIP]
> If you can reproduce the problem on your local machine, then your next step is to investigate the [MSBuild](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild?view=vs-2019&preserve-view=true) issue.

For more information on [Microsoft hosted agents](../../agents/hosted.md#microsoft-hosted-agents)

To setup your own self-hosted agent and run the build jobs:

* [Self-hosted Windows agents](../../agents/v2-windows.md#self-hosted-windows-agents)
* [Self-hosted Linux agents](../../agents/v2-linux.md#self-hosted-linux-agents)
* [Self-hosted macOS agents](../../agents/v2-osx.md#self-hosted-macos-agents)

##### What else can I do?

At the bottom of this page, check out the GitHub issues in the `Open` and `Closed` tabs to see if there is a similar issue that has been resolved previously by our team.

Some of the MSBuild errors are caused by a change in Visual Studio so you can search on [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/8/index.html) to see if this issue has been reported. We also welcome your questions, suggestions, and feedback.
