## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Azure Pipelines connection** | The name of a Generic service connection that references the Azure DevOps organization you will be running the load test from and publishing the results to.<br />- Required for builds and releases on TFS and must specify a connection to the Azure DevOps organization where the load test will run.<br />- Optional for builds and releases on Azure Pipelines. In this case, if not provided, the current Azure Pipelines connection is used.<br />- See [Generic service connection](../../library/service-endpoints.md). |
| **Website URL** | Required. The URL of the app to test. |
| **Test Name** | Required. A name for this load test, used to identify it for reporting and for comparison with other test runs. |
| **User Load** | Required. The number of concurrent users to simulate in this test. Select a value from the drop-down list. |
| **Run Duration (sec)** | Required. The duration of this test in seconds. Select a value from the drop-down list. |
| **Load Location** | The location from which the load will be generated. Select a global Azure location, or **Default** to generate the load from the location associated with your Azure DevOps organization. |
| **Run load test using** | Select **Automatically provisioned agents** if you want the cloud-based load testing service to automatically provision agents for running the load tests. The application URL must be accessible from the Internet.<br />Select **Self-provisioned agents** if you want to test apps behind the firewall. You must provision agents and register them against your Azure DevOps organization when using this option. See [Testing private/intranet applications using Cloud-based load testing](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/08/23/testing-privateintranet-applications-using-cloud-based-load-testing/). |
| **Fail test if Avg. Response Time (ms) exceeds** | Specify a threshold for the average response time in milliseconds. If the observed response time during the load test exceeds this threshold, the task will fail. |
| **Control options** | See [Control options](../../process/tasks.md#controloptions) |
