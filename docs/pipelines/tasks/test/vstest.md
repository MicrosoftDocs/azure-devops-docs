# Visual Studio Test task

**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to run unit and functional tests (Selenium, Appium, Coded UI test, and more)
using the Visual Studio Test Runner. Other than MSTest-based tests, test frameworks that have a
Visual Studio test adapter, such as xUnit, NUnit, Chutzpah, can also be executed.  

Tests that target the .NET core framework can be executed by specifying the appropriate target framework value.  

Tests can be distributed on multiple agents using version 2 of this task. 

## Demands 

The agent must have the following capability:

**vstest**

The vstest demand can be satisfied in two ways: 

1. Visual Studio is installed on the agent machine. 

2. By using the [Visual Studio Test Platform Installer task](../tool/vstest-platform-tool-installer.md) in the pipeline definition.

<tr><td><b>tcmTestRun</b><br>Test Run</td><td>(Optional) Test run based selection is used when triggering [automated test runs from test plans](../../../test/run-automated-tests-from-test-hub.md). This option cannot be used for running tests in the CI/CD pipeline.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>searchFolder</b><br>Search folder</td><td>(Required) Folder to search for the test assemblies.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>testFiltercriteria</b><br>Test filter criteria</td><td>(Optional) Additional criteria to filter tests from Test assemblies. For example: `Priority=1|Name=MyTestMethod`. [More information](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj155796.aspx)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>runOnlyImpactedTests</b><br>Run only impacted tests</td><td>(Optional) Automatically select, and run only the tests needed to validate the code change. [More information](https://aka.ms/tialearnmore)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>runAllTestsAfterXBuilds</b><br>Number of builds after which all tests should be run</td><td>(Optional) Number of builds after which to automatically run all tests. Test Impact Analysis stores the mapping between test cases and source code. It is recommended to regenerate the mapping by running all tests, on a regular basis.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>uiTests</b><br>Test mix contains UI tests</td><td>(Optional) To run UI tests, ensure that the agent is set to [run in interactive mode with autologon enabled](../../agents/agents.md). Setting up an agent to run interactively must be done before queueing the build / release. Checking this box does <b>not</b> configure the agent in interactive mode automatically. This option in the task is to only serve as a reminder to configure agent appropriately to avoid failures. Hosted Windows agents from the VS 2015 and 2017 pools can be used to run UI tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>vstestLocationMethod</b><br>Select test platform using</td><td>(Optional) Specify which test platform should be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>vsTestVersion</b><br>Test platform version</td><td>(Optional) The version of Visual Studio test to use. If latest is specified it chooses Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio 2015 depending on what is installed. Visual Studio 2013 is not supported. To run tests without needing Visual Studio on the agent, use the ‘Installed by tools installer’ option. Be sure to include the ‘Visual Studio Test Platform Installer’ task to acquire the test platform from NuGet.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>vstestLocation</b><br>Path to vstest.console.exe</td><td>(Optional) Specify the path to VSTest.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>runSettingsFile</b><br>Settings file</td><td>(Optional) Path to runsettings or testsettings file to use with the tests.Starting with Visual Studio 15.7, it is recommended to use [runsettings](/visualstudio/test/configure-unit-tests-by-using-a-dot-runsettings-file) for all types of tests. To learn more about converting a .testsettings file to a .runsettings file, see [this topic](https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-docs/blob/master/RFCs/0023-TestSettings-Deprecation.md).</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>overrideTestrunParameters</b><br>Override test run parameters</td><td>(Optional) Override parameters defined in the `TestRunParameters` section of runsettings file or `Properties` section of testsettings file. For example: `-key1 value1 -key2 value2`. Note: Properties specified in testsettings file can be accessed via the TestContext using Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 or higher </td></tr>
<tr><td><b>pathtoCustomTestAdapters</b><br>Path to custom test adapters</td><td>(Optional) Directory path to custom test adapters. Adapters residing in the same folder as the test assemblies are automatically discovered.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>runInParallel</b><br>Run tests in parallel on multi-core machines</td><td>(Optional) If set, tests will run in parallel leveraging available cores of the machine. This will override the MaxCpuCount if specified in your runsettings file. [Click here](https://aka.ms/paralleltestexecution) to learn more about how tests are run in parallel.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>runTestsInIsolation</b><br>Run tests in isolation</td><td>(Optional) Runs the tests in an isolated process. This makes vstest.console.exe process less likely to be stopped on an error in the tests, but tests might run slower. This option currently cannot be used when running with the multi-agent job setting.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>codeCoverageEnabled</b><br>Code coverage enabled</td><td>(Optional) Collect code coverage information from the test run.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>otherConsoleOptions</b><br>Other console options</td><td>(Optional) Other console options that can be passed to vstest.console.exe, as documented <a href="https://aka.ms/vstestotherconsoleoptions" target="_blank">here</a>. <p>These options are not supported and will be ignored when running tests using the ‘Multi agent’ parallel setting of an agent job or when running tests using ‘Test plan’ option. The options can be specified using a settings file instead.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>distributionBatchType</b><br>Batch tests</td><td>(Optional) A batch is a group of tests. A batch of tests runs at a time and results are published for that batch. If the job in which the task runs is set to use multiple agents, each agent picks up any available batches of tests to run in parallel.<br><br><b>Based on number of tests and agents:</b> Simple batching based on the number of tests and agents participating in the test run.<br><br><b>Based on past running time of tests:</b> This batching considers past running time to create batches of tests such that each batch has approximately equal running time.<br><br><b>Based on test assemblies:</b> Tests from an assembly are batched together.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>batchingBasedOnAgentsOption</b><br>Batch options</td><td>(Optional) Simple batching based on the number of tests and agents participating in the test run. When the batch size is automatically determined, each batch contains `(total number of tests / number of agents)` tests.

<tr><td><b>customBatchSizeValue</b><br>Number of tests per batch</td><td>(Required) Specify batch size</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>batchingBasedOnExecutionTimeOption</b><br>Batch options</td><td>(Optional) This batching considers past running time to create batches of tests such that each batch has approximately equal running time. Quick running tests will be batched together, while longer running tests may belong to a separate batch. When this option is used with the multi-agent job setting, total test time is reduced to a minimum.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>customRunTimePerBatchValue</b><br>Running time (sec) per batch</td><td>(Required) Specify the running time (sec) per batch</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>dontDistribute</b><br>Do not distribute tests and replicate instead when multiple agents are used in the job</td><td>(Optional) Choosing this option will not distribute tests across agents when the task is running in a multi-agent job.<br>Each of the selected test(s) will be repeated on each agent.<br>The option is not applicable when the agent job is configured to run with no parallelism or with the multi-config option.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>testRunTitle</b><br>Test run title</td><td>(Optional) Provide a name for the test run.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>platform</b><br>Build platform</td><td>(Optional) Build platform against which the tests should be reported. If you have defined a variable for platform in your build task, use that here.</td></tr>
