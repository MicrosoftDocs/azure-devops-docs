# Azure CLI task

**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to run a shell or batch 
script containing Azure CLI commands against an Azure subscription.

This task is used to run Azure CLI commands on 
cross-platform agents running on Linux, macOS, or Windows operating systems.
 
This task is under development. If you encounter problems, or wish to
share feedback about the task and features you would like to see,
please [contact us](mailto:RM_Customer_Queries@microsoft.com).

### What's new in Version 1.0

- Supports the new [AZ CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/overview), which is Python based
- Works with agents on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- To work with [Azure CLI 1.0](/azure/cli-install-nodejs), which is node based, switch to task version 0.0
- Both versions of Azure-CLI can coexist in the same system, but task V1.0 logs into the Python based AZ CLI using the user's subscription, whereas task V0.0 logs into the node based Azure CLI. Therefore, scripts should include only the appropriate corresponding commands.
- Limitations:
  - No support for Classic subscriptions. AZ CLI 2.0 supports only Azure Resource Manager (ARM) subscriptions
  - Currently, Microsoft-hosted agents do not have AZ CLI installed. You can either install using `npm install -g azure-cli` or use self-hosted agents with AZ CLI pre-installed

## Demands

None

## Prerequisites

* A Microsoft Azure subscription
* A service connection to your Azure account. You can use either:
  - [Azure Classic service connection](../../library/service-endpoints.md#sep-azure-classic)
  - [Azure Resource Manager service connection](../../library/connect-to-azure.md)
* Azure CLI installed on the computer(s) that run the build and release agent.
  See [Install the Azure CLI](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/).
  If an agent is already running on the machine on which the Azure CLI is installed, restart the agent to ensure all the relevent stage variables are updated.
