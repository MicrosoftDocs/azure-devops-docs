### Error: Could not fetch access token for Azure. Verify if the Service Principal used is valid and not expired.

The task uses the service principal in the service connection to authenticate with Azure. If the service principal has expired or doesn't have permissions to the App Service, the task fails with this error. Verify the validity of the service principal used and that it's present in the app registration. For more information, see 
   [Use role-based access control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).
   [This blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/automating-azure-resource-group-deployment-using-a-service-principal-in-visual-studio-online-buildrelease-management/)
   also contains more information about using service principal authentication.

### SSL error

If you want to use a certificate in App Service, the certificate must be signed by a trusted certificate authority. If your web app gives you certificate validation errors, you're probably using a self-signed certificate. Set a variable named `VSTS_ARM_REST_IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS` to the value `true` in the build or release pipeline to resolve the error.

### A release hangs for long time and then fails

This problem could be the result of insufficient capacity in your App Service plan. To resolve this problem, you can scale up the App Service instance to increase available CPU, RAM, and disk space or try with a different App Service plan.
