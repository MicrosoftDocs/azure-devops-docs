# Azure Database for MySQL Deployment task

**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task to run your scripts and make changes to your database in Azure Database for MySQL. Note that this is a preview version. The Azure Database for MySQL Deployment task only works with [Azure Database for MySQL Single Server](/azure/mysql/single-server-overview).

## Arguments

|Argument|Description|
|--- |--- |
|`ConnectedServiceName`<br/>Azure Subscription|(Required) This is needed to connect to your Azure account.<br><br>To configure a new service connection, select the Azure subscription from the list and click 'Authorize'.<br><br>If your subscription is not listed or if you want to use an existing service principal, you can set up an Azure service connection using the 'Add' or 'Manage' buttons. <br/><br>Argument alias: `azureSubscription`|
|`ServerName`<br/>Host Name|(Required) The name of your Azure Database for MySQL server.<br/><br>Example: `fabrikam.mysql.database.azure.com`<br><br>The server name is provided in the Azure portal on the 'Overview' blade of your Azure Database for MySQL server resource.<br><br>When you connect using MySQL Workbench, this is the same value that is used for 'Hostname' in 'Parameters'.|
|`DatabaseName`<br/>Database Name|(Optional) The name of the database. If specified, the task attempts to create the database if it does not exist.<br><br>If not specified, ensure that the database is referenced in the supplied SQL file or inline SQL, where needed.<br><br>**Note:** MySQL database names are case-sensitive.|
|`SqlUsername`<br/>Server Admin Login|(Required) Azure Database for MySQL server supports native MySQL authentication.<br><br>You can connect and authenticate to a server with the server's admin login.<br><br/>Example: `Mysqladmin`<br><br>When you connect using MySQL Workbench, this is the same value that is used for 'Username' in 'Parameters'.|
|`SqlPassword`<br/>Password|(Required) The password for the username supplied to the `SqlUsername` argument. If you don't recall the password, you can change the password in the Azure portal. It can be a variable defined in the pipeline. <br/><br>Example: `$(password)`<br><br>Also, you may mark the variable type as 'secret' to secure it.|
|`TaskNameSelector`<br/>Type|(Optional) Accepted values:<br><br>- `SqlTaskFile` (default), for use with the `SqlFile` argument<br>- `InlineSqlTask`, for use with the `SqlInline` argument.<br><br>**Note:** These values are case-sensitive.|
|`SqlFile`<br/>MySQL Script|(Required) Full path of the script file on the automation agent or on a UNC path that's accessible to the automation agent.<br><br>Example: `\BudgetIT\DeployBuilds\script.sql`<br><br>You may also use predefined system variables, for example `$(agent.releaseDirectory)`.<br><br>The given path is expected to reference a SQL file that contains SQL statements.<br><br>**Note:** The MySQL client prefers Unix style paths so, from version 1.183.0, the task will convert Windows style paths to Unix style paths. Example: From `c:\foo\bar\myscript.sql` to `c:/foo/bar/myscript.sql`. When the task is used on Linux platforms, paths remain unchanged. There is no need to escape special characters in paths.|
|`SqlInline`<br/>Inline MySQL Script|(Required) Enter the MySQL script to execute on the selected database.<br><br>Example: `UPDATE my_table SET my_col = 'foo';`|
|`SqlAdditionalArguments`<br/>Additional MySQL client options|(Optional) Additional options supported by the MySQL client.<br><br>These options are applied when you execute the file on the database in Azure Database for MySQL.<br><br>Examples include:<br>- `--comments` to strip comments sent from the client to the server.<br>- `--quick` to prevent result caching.<br> - `--xml` to output results as XML.<br><br>All available options are described in the MySQL client documentation.|
|`IpDetectionMethod`<br/>Specify Firewall Rules Using|(Required) For successful execution of the task, we need to enable administrators to access the Azure Database for MySQL server from the IP address of the automation agent. By selecting auto-detect, you can automatically add a firewall exception for a range of possible IP addresses for the automation agent, or you can explicitly specify the range.<br><br>Accepted values:<br><br>- `AutoDetect` to auto-detect the automation agent's public IP address.<br>- `IPAddressRange` to explicitly specify the IP address range to configure. Set the IP address range using the `StartIpAddress` and `EndIpAddress` parameters.<br><br>**Note:** These values are case-sensitive.|
|`StartIpAddress`<br/>Start IP Address|(Required) The starting IP address of the automation agent machine pool.<br><br>Example: `198.51.100.1`|
|`EndIpAddress`<br/>End IP Address|(Required) The ending IP address of the automation agent machine pool.<br><br>Example: `198.51.100.65`|
|`DeleteFirewallRule`<br/>Delete Rule After Task Ends|(Optional) If selected, the added exception for IP addresses of the automation agent is removed for the corresponding database in Azure Database for MySQL.|
