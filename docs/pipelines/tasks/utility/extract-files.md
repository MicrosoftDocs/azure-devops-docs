# Extract Files task

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2017-rtm.md)]

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to extract files from archives to a target folder using match patterns.
A range of standard archive formats is supported, including .zip, .jar, .war, .ear, .tar, .7z, and more.

## Demands

## Arguments

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Argument</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Archive file patterns</td>
<td>
<p>The archives you want to extract. The default file path is relative from the root folder of the repo (same as if you had specified ```$(Build.SourcesDirectory)```).</p>
<p>Specify match pattern filters (one on each line) that you want to apply to identify the list of archives to extract. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>``` test.zip``` extracts the test.zip file to the root folder.</li>
<li>```test\*.zip``` extracts all .zip files in the test folder.</li>
<li>```**\*.tar``` extracts all .tar files in the root folder and sub-folders.</li>
<li>```**\bin\*.7z``` extracts all ''.7z'' files in any sub-folder named bin.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pattern is used to match only archive file paths, not folder paths, and not archive contents to be extracted. So you should specify patterns such as ```**\bin\**``` instead of ```**\bin```.</p>
