# Install Apple Provisioning Profile task

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2018](../../_shared/version-tfs-2018.md)]

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to install an Apple provisioning profile that is required to build on a macOS agent.
You can use this task to install provisioning profiles needed to build iOS Apps, Apple WatchKit Apps and App Extensions.

You can install an Apple provisioning profile that is:

- Stored as a [secure file](../../library/secure-files.md) on the server.
- (**Azure Pipelines**) Committed to the source repository or copied to a local path on the macOS agent. We recommend encrypting the provisioning profiles if you are committing them to the source repository. The **Decrypt File** task can be used to decrypt them during a build or release.
