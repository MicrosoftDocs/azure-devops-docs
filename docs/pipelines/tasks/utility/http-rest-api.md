## Arguments

| Parameter | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Connection type** | Required. Select **Azure Resource Manager** to invoke an Azure managment API or **Generic** for all other APIs. |
| **Generic service connection** | Required. Generic service connection that provides the baseUrl for the call and the authorization to use. |
| **Azure subscription** | Required. Azure Resource Manager subscription to configure and use for invoking Azure management APIs. |
| **Method** | Required. The HTTP method with which the API will be invoked; for example, **GET**, **PUT**, or **UPDATE**. |
| **Headers** | Optional. The header in JSON format to be attached to the request sent to the API. |
| **Body** | Optional. The request body for the function call in JSON format. |
| **URL suffix and parameters** | The string to append to the baseUrl from the Generic service connection while making the HTTP call | 
| **Wait for completion** | Required. How the task reports completion. Can be **API response** (the default) - completion is when the function returns success within 20 seconds and the success criteria evaluates to true, or **Callback** - the external service makes a callback to update the timeline record.   |
| **Success criteria** | Optional. How to parse the response body for success. By default, the task passes when 200 OK is returned from the call. Additionally, the success criteria - if specified - is evaluated. |
| **Control options** | See [Control options](../../process/tasks.md#controloptions) |

Succeeds if the API returns success and the response body parsing is successful, or when the API updates the timeline record with success.

The **Invoke REST API task** does not perform deployment actions directly.
Instead, it allows you to invoke any generic HTTP REST API as part of the automated
pipeline and, optionally, wait for it to be completed.

## Q&A

### What base URLs are used when invoking Azure Management APIs?

Azure management APIs are invoked using *ResourceManagerEndpoint* of the selected environment. For example `https://management.Azure.com` is used when the subscription is in **AzureCloud** environment.

### Where should a task signal completion when **Callback** is chosen as the completion event?

To signal completion, the external service should POST completion data to the following pipelines REST endpoint.
```
{planUri}/{projectId}/_apis/distributedtask/hubs/{hubName}/plans/{planId}/events?api-version=2.0-preview.1

**Request Body**
 { "name": "TaskCompleted", "taskId": "taskInstanceId", "jobId": "jobId", "result": "succeeded" }
 ```

In addition, a C# helper library is available to enable live logging and managing task status for agentless tasks. [Learn more](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/aseemb/2017/12/18/async-http-agentless-task/)
