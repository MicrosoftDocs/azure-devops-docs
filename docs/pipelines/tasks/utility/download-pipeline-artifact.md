# Download Pipeline Artifacts task

Use this task in a build or release pipeline to download pipeline artifacts from earlier stages in this pipeline, or from another pipeline.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

## YAML snippet

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/yaml/DownloadPipelineArtifactV2.md)]

::: moniker-end

## Arguments


| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `buildType`<br/>Download artifacts produced by | Download artifacts produced by the current pipeline run, or from a specific pipeline run.<br/>Options: `current`, `specific` |
| `specificBuildWithTriggering`<br/>When appropriate, download artifacts from the triggering build | A boolean specifying whether to download artifacts from a triggering build. |
| `tags`<br/>Build Tags | A comma-delimited list of tags. Only builds with these tags will be returned. |
| `artifactName`<br/>Artifact Name | The name of the artifact to download. If left empty, all artifacts associated to the pipeline run will be downloaded. |
| `itemPattern`<br/>Matching Patterns | One or more file matching patterns (new line delimited) that limit which files get downloaded. [More Information on file matching patterns](../file-matching-patterns.md) |
| `targetPath`<br/>Destination Directory | Directory to download the artifact files. Can be relative to the pipeline workspace directory or absolute. If multi-download option is applied (by leaving an empty artifact name), a sub-directory will be created for each. See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../../artifacts/pipeline-artifacts.md). |
| `project`<br/>Project | The project GUID from which to download the pipeline artifacts. |
| `definition`<br/>Build Pipeline | The definition ID of the build pipeline. |
| `buildVersionToDownload`<br/>Build version to download | Specifies which build version to download. Options: `latest`, `latestFromBranch`, `specific` |
| `branchName`<br/>Branch Name | Specify to filter on branch/ref name, for example: `refs/heads/develop`. |
| `pipelineId`<br/>Build | The build from which to download the artifacts. For example: `1764` |
| [!INCLUDE [control-options-arguments-md](../_shared/control-options-arguments-md.md)] | |

## Examples

### Download a specific artifact

```YAML
# Download an artifact named 'WebApp' to 'bin' in $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    artifactName: 'WebApp'
    targetPath: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/bin
```

### Download artifacts from a specific project/pipeline

```YAML
# Download artifacts from a specific pipeline.
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    buildType: 'specific'
    project: 'FabrikamFiber'
    pipelineId: 12
    buildVersionToDownload: 'latest'
```

### Download artifacts from a specific branch

```YAML
# Download artifacts from a specific branch with a tag
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    buildType: 'specific'
    project: 'FabrikamFiber'
    pipelineId: 12
    buildVersionToDownload: 'latestFromBranch'
    branchName: 'refs/heads/master'
    tags: 'testTag'
```

### Download an artifact from a specific build run

```YAML
# Download an artifact named 'WebApp' from a specific build run to 'bin' in $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
- task: DownloadPipelineArtifact@2
  inputs:
    buildType: 'specific'
    artifact: 'WebApp'
    targetPath: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/bin
    project: 'FabrikamFiber'
    pipelineId: 12
    buildVersionToDownload: 'specific'
```

## Q&A

### How can I find the ID of the Pipeline I want to download an artifact from? 

You can find the ID of the pipeline in the 'Pipeline variables'. The pipeline ID is the [system.definitionId](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#system-variables) variable.
