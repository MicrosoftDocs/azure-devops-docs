**Azure Pipelines**

Use this task in a pipeline to install an SSH key prior to a build or release step.

## Arguments

<table><thead><tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>

## Example setup using GitHub

1. Create an SSH key using `ssh-keygen` - a program that is provided with the SSH package on Linux and macOS and comes with Git for Windows. When you run `ssh-keygen`, you will be prompted to provide an SSH passphrase and two files will be created: a public key and a private key (e.g. `mykey.pub` and `mykey`).
1. Upload the `mykey.pub` (public) SSH key to GitHub (see GitHub's [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) for help).
1. On a local computer, add the private SSH key by running `ssh-add ~/.ssh/mykey`, replacing `~/.ssh/mykey` with the path to your private key file.
1. Clone the repository to the local computer (`git clone git@github.com:myOrganizationName/myRepositoryName.git`).
1. While cloning the repository, you will be asked whether to trust GitHub. Accepting will add the SSH key to your `known_hosts` file.
1. Open your `known_hosts` file (`~/.ssh/known_hosts` or `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\known_hosts`) and copy the line that was added.

You now have all necessary values for the "Install SSH Key" task:
- 'Known Hosts Entry' - Enter the line copied in step 6
- 'SSH Key', 'SSH Public Key', and 'SSH Passphrase' - Enter these values that were created in step 1
