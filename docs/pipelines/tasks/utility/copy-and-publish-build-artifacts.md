<tr>
<td>Copy Root</td>
<td>
<p>Folder that contains the files you want to copy. If you leave it empty, the copying is done from the root folder of the repo (same as if you had specified ```$(Build.SourcesDirectory)```).</p>
<p>If your build produces artifacts outside of the sources directory, specify ```$(Agent.BuildDirectory)``` to copy files from the build agent working directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contents</td>
<td><p>Specify pattern filters (one on each line) that you want to apply to the list of files to be copied. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>```**``` copies all files in the root folder.</li>
<li>```**\*``` copies all files in the root folder and all files in all sub-folders.</li>
<li>```**\bin``` copies files in any sub-folder named bin.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<tr>
<td>Artifact Name</td>
<td>Specify the name of the artifact. For example: `drop`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Artifact Type</td>
<td>
<p>Choose **server** to store the artifact on your Team Foundation Server. This is the best and simplest option in most cases. See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../../build/artifacts.md).</p>

## Q & A

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### Q: This step didn't produce the outcome I was expecting. How can I fix it?

This task has a couple of known issues:

* Some minimatch patterns don't work.

* It eliminates the most common root path for all paths matched.

You can avoid these issues by instead using the [Copy Files task](copy-files.md) and the [Publish Build Artifacts task](publish-build-artifacts.md).
