<tr>
<td>FTP service connection</td>
<td>
<p>Select the service connection for your FTP server.  To create one, click the Manage link and create a new Generic service connection, enter the FTP server URL for the server URL, e.g. <b>`ftp://server.example.com`</b>, and required credentials.<p>Secure connections will always be made regardless of the specified protocol (<b>`ftp://`</b> or <b>`ftps://`</b>) if the target server supports FTPS.  To allow only secure connections, use the <b>`ftps://`</b> protocol, e.g. <b>`ftps://server.example.com`</b>.  Connections to servers not supporting FTPS will fail if <b>`ftps://`</b> is specified.</p>
</td>
