| `serverEndpoint` <br/>FTP Service Connection| (Required) Select the service connection for your FTP server.  To create one, click the Manage link and create a new Generic service connection, enter the FTP server URL for the server URL, Example, ftp://server.example.com, and required credentials. <br/>Secure connections will always be made regardless of the specified protocol (**ftp://** or **ftps://**) if the target server supports FTPS.  To allow only secure connections, use the **ftps://** protocol. For example, **ftps://server.example.com**.  Connections to servers not supporting FTPS will fail if **ftps://** is specified.|
| `serverUrl` <br/> Server URL | (Required) |
| `username` <br/> Username | (Required) |
| `password` <br/> Password | (Required) |
| `rootFolder` <br/> Root folder | (Required) The source folder to upload files from <br/>Argument aliases: `rootDirectory`|
| `filePatterns` <br/> File patterns | (Required) File paths or patterns of the files to upload.  Supports multiple lines of minimatch patterns. [More Information](./extract-files.md).<br/>Default value: **|
| `remotePath` <br/> Remote directory | (Required) Upload files to this directory on the remote FTP server. <br/>Default value: /upload/$(Build.BuildId)/ <br/>Argument aliases: `remoteDirectory`|

| `preservePaths` <br/> Preserve file paths | (Required) If selected, the relative local directory structure is recreated under the remote directory where files are uploaded.  Otherwise, files are uploaded directly to the remote directory without creating additional subdirectories. <br/>For example, suppose your source folder is: **/home/user/source/** and contains the file: **foo/bar/foobar.txt**, and your remote directory is: **/uploads/**. <br/>If selected, the file is uploaded to: **/uploads/foo/bar/foobar.txt**.  Otherwise, to: **/uploads/foobar.txt** <br/>Default value: false|
| `trustSSL` <br/> Trust server certificate | (Required) Selecting this option results in the FTP server's SSL certificate being trusted with ftps://, even if it is self-signed or cannot be validated by a Certificate Authority (CA). <br/>Default value: false|
