Variables give you a convenient way to get key bits of data into various parts of your build pipeline.
This is the comprehensive list of predefined build variables.

These variables are automatically set by the system and read-only. (The exceptions are Build.Clean and System.Debug.)
Learn more about [working with variables](../process/variables.md).

## Build.Clean 

::: moniker range="> tfs-2017"

This is a deprecated variable that modifies how the build agent cleans up source.
To learn how to clean up source, see [source repositories](repository.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2017"

This variable modifies how the build agent cleans up source.
To learn more, see [source repositories](repository.md).

## System.Debug

For more detailed logs to debug pipeline problems, define `System.Debug` and set it to `true`.

### How are the identity variables set?

The value depends on what caused the build.

| If the build is triggered... | Then the Build.QueuedBy and Build.QueuedById values are based on... | Then the Build.RequestedFor and Build.RequestedForId values are based on... |
| --- | --- | ---|
| In Git or TFVC by the [Continuous integration (CI) triggers](triggers.md) | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` | The person who pushed or checked in the changes. |
| In Git or by a [branch policy build](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md#build-validation). | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` | The person who checked in the changes. |
| In TFVC by a [gated check-in trigger](triggers.md) | The person who checked in the changes. | The person who checked in the changes. |
| In Git or TFVC by the [Scheduled triggers](triggers.md) | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` |
| Because you clicked the **Queue build** button | You | You |
