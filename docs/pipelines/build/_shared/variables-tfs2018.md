## Agent variables

> [!NOTE]
> You can use agent variables as environment variables in your scripts and as parameters in your build tasks.
> You cannot use them to customize the build number or to apply a version control label or tag.

<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>Agent.BuildDirectory</td>
<td>

<p>For example: <code>c:\agent\_work\1</code></p>
</td>
</tr>

<td>Agent.ToolsDirectory</td>
<td>
The directory used by tasks such as [Node Tool Installer](../../tasks/tool/node-js.md) and [Use Python Version](../../tasks/tool/use-python-version.md) to switch between multiple versions of a tool.
These tasks will add tools from this directory to <code>PATH</code> so that subsequent build steps can use them.
