## Build variables

<table>
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory</td>
<td>The local path on the agent where any artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination.
<br/><br/>
A typical way to use this folder is to publish your build artifacts with the <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/copy-files" data-raw-source="[Copy files](../../tasks/utility/copy-files.md)">Copy files</a> and <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/utility/publish-build-artifacts" data-raw-source="[Publish build artifacts](../../tasks/utility/publish-build-artifacts.md)">Publish build artifacts</a> tasks. See <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/artifacts/artifacts-overview" data-raw-source="[Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../artifacts.md)">Artifacts in Azure Pipelines</a>.
<br/><br/>
For example:
<ul>
<li>TFS 2015.4: <code>C:\TfsData\Agents\Agent-MACHINENAME_work\1\a</code>
<li>TFS 2015 RTM default agent: <code>C:\TfsData\Build_work\6c3842c6\artifacts</code>
<li>TFS 2015 RTM agent installed by you: <code>C:\Agent_work\6c3842c6\artifacts</code>
</ul>
This directory is purged before each new build, so you don&#39;t have to clean it up yourself.
<br/><br/>
In <strong>TFS 2015.4</strong>, Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory are interchangeable.
<br/><br/>
This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag.
</td>

<tr>
<td>Build.BuildId</td>
<td>The ID of the record for the completed build.</td>

A typical use of this variable is to make it part of the label format, which you specify on the <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/repos/index" data-raw-source="[repository tab](../repos/index.md)">repository tab</a>.


Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the <a href="/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/labels-command" data-raw-source="[label format](../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md)">label format</a> will fail.

<br/><br/>
For example: <code>C:\TfsData\Agents\Agent-MACHINENAME_work\1\b</code>
