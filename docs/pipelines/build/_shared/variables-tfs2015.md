<tr>
<td>Agent.BuildDirectory</td>

## Build variables

<table>
<tr><th>Variable</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory</td>
<td>The local path on the agent where any artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination.
<br/><br/>
A typical way to use this folder is to publish your build artifacts with the [Copy files](../../tasks/utility/copy-files.md) and [Publish build artifacts](../../tasks/utility/publish-build-artifacts.md) tasks. See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../artifacts.md).
<br/><br/>
For example:
<ul>
<li>TFS 2015.4: `C:\TfsData\Agents\Agent-MACHINENAME\_work\1\a`
<li>TFS 2015 RTM default agent: `C:\TfsData\Build\_work\6c3842c6\artifacts`
<li>TFS 2015 RTM agent installed by you: `C:\Agent\_work\6c3842c6\artifacts`
</ul>
This directory is purged before each new build, so you don't have to clean it up yourself.
<br/><br/>
In **TFS 2015.4**, Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory are interchangeable.
<br/><br/>
This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Build.BuildId</td>
<td>The ID of the record for the completed build.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Build.BuildNumber</td>
<td>The name of the completed build. You can specify the build number format that generates this value in the [pipeline options](../options.md).

A typical use of this variable is to make it part of the label format, which you specify on the [repository tab](../repository.md).
                
[!INCLUDE [include](../_shared/variables-invalid-label-characters.md)]

</tr>

<tr>
<td>Build.BinariesDirectory</td>
<td>
The local path on the agent you can use as an output folder for compiled binaries. Available in **TFS 2015.4**.
<br/><br/>
By default, new build pipelines are not set up to clean this directory. You can define your build to clean it up on the [Repository tab](../repository.md).
<br/><br/>
For example: `C:\TfsData\Agents\Agent-MACHINENAME\_work\1\b`
<br/><br/>
This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag.

</ul>
When you use this variable in your build number format, the forward slash characters (`/`) are replaced with underscore characters <code>&#095;</code>).
