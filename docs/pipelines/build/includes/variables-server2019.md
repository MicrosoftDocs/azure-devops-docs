## Agent variables (DevOps Server 2019)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use agent variables as environment variables in your scripts and as parameters in your build tasks.
> You cannot use them to customize the build number or to apply a version control label or tag.

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Agent.BuildDirectory | The local path on the agent where all folders for a given build pipeline are created. For example: `c:\agent_work\1`. |
| Agent.HomeDirectory | The directory the agent is installed into. This contains the agent software. For example: `c:\agent`. |
| Agent.Id | The ID of the agent. |
| Agent.JobName | The name of the running job. This will usually be "Job" or "__default", but in multi-config scenarios, will be the configuration. |
| Agent.JobStatus | The status of the build.<br>    <ul>        <li>`Canceled`        <li>`Failed`        <li>`Succeeded`        <li>`SucceededWithIssues` (partially successful)    <li>`Skipped` (last job)</ul>The environment variable should be referenced as `AGENT_JOBSTATUS`. The older `agent.jobstatus` is available for backwards compatibility. |
| Agent.MachineName | The name of the machine on which the agent is installed. |
| Agent.Name | The name of the agent that is registered with the pool.<br><br>If you're using a self-hosted agent, then this name get set by you. See [agents](../../agents/agents.md). |
| Agent.OS | The operating system of the agent host. Valid values are:<br><ul><li>`Windows_NT`<li>`Darwin`<li>`Linux`</ul>If you're running in a container, the agent host and container may be running different operating systems. |
| Agent.OSArchitecture | The operating system processor architecture of the agent host. Valid values are:<br><ul><li>`X86`<li>`X64`<li>`ARM processor`</ul> |
| Agent.TempDirectory | A temporary folder that is cleaned after each pipeline job. This directory is used by tasks such as [.NET Core CLI task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/dotnet-core-cli-v2) to hold temporary items like test results before they're published. |
| Agent.ToolsDirectory | The directory used by tasks such as [Node Tool Installer](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/node-tool-v0) and [Use Python Version](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-python-version-v0) to switch between multiple versions of a tool. <br><br>These tasks add tools from this directory to `PATH` so that subsequent build steps can use them. <br><br>Learn about [managing this directory on a self-hosted agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2008884). |
| Agent.WorkFolder | The working directory for this agent. For example: `c:\agent_work`. <br><br>This directory isn't guaranteed to be writable by pipeline tasks (for example, when mapped into a container). |

## Build variables (DevOps Server 2019)

<a id="build-variables"></a>

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory | The local path on the agent where any artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\a`. <br><br>A typical way to use this folder is to publish your build artifacts with the [Copy files](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) and [Publish build artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1) tasks. <br><br>Note: Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory are interchangeable. This directory is purged before each new build, so you don't have to clean it up yourself. <br><br>See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md). <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. |
| Build.BuildId | The ID of the record for the completed build. |
| Build.BuildNumber | The name of the completed build. You can specify the build number format that generates this value in the [pipeline options](../options.md). <br><br>A typical use of this variable is to make it part of the label format, which you specify on the [repository tab](../../repos/index.md).<br><br>Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the [label format](../../../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md) fails.<br><br>This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. |
| Build.BuildUri | The URI for the build. For example: `vstfs:///Build/Build/1430`. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. |
| Build.BinariesDirectory | The local path on the agent you can use as an output folder for compiled binaries. <br><br>By default, new build pipelines aren't set up to clean this directory. You can define your build to clean it up on the [Repository tab](../../repos/index.md). <br><br>For example: `c:\agent_work\1\b`. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. |
| Build.DefinitionName | The name of the build pipeline. <br><br>Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the [label format](../../../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md) will fail. |
| Build.DefinitionVersion | The version of the build pipeline. |
| Build.QueuedBy | See "[How are the identity variables set?](#identity_values)". <br><br>Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the [label format](../../../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md) fails. |
| Build.QueuedById | See "[How are the identity variables set?](#identity_values)". |
| Build.Reason | The event that caused the build to run. <br><ul><li>`Manual`: A user manually queued the build.</li><li>`IndividualCI`: **Continuous integration (CI)** triggered by a Git push or a TFVC check-in.</li><li>`BatchedCI`: **Continuous integration (CI)** triggered by a Git push or a TFVC check-in, and the **Batch changes** was selected.</li><li>`Schedule`: **Scheduled** trigger.</li><li>`ValidateShelveset`: A user manually queued the build of a specific TFVC shelveset.</li><li>`CheckInShelveset`: **Gated check-in** trigger.</li><li>`PullRequest`: The build was triggered by a Git branch policy that requires a build.</li><li>`BuildCompletion`: The build was [triggered by another build](../../process/pipeline-triggers.md).</li></ul>See [Build pipeline triggers](../triggers.md), [Improve code quality with branch policies](../../../repos/git/branch-policies.md). |

It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. |
| Build.Repository.LocalPath | The local path on the agent where your source code files are downloaded. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\s`<br><br>By default, new build pipelines update only the changed files. You can modify how files are downloaded on the [Repository tab](../../repos/index.md). <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped. It can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task, but not as part of the build number or as a version control tag. <br><br>This variable is synonymous with Build.SourcesDirectory. |

| Build.SourceBranchName | The name of the branch the build was queued for.<br><ul><li>Git repo branch, pull request, or tag: The last path segment in the ref. For example, in `refs/heads/main` this value is `main`. In `refs/heads/feature/tools` this value is `tools`.
