## Agent variables (DevOps Server 2020)

> [!NOTE]
> You can use agent variables as environment variables in your scripts and as parameters in your build tasks.
> You can't use them to customize the build number or to apply a version control label or tag.

| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| Agent.BuildDirectory | The local path on the agent where all folders for a given build pipeline are created. This variable has the same value as `Pipeline.Workspace`. For example: `/home/vsts/work/1`. For more information about the agent directory structure, see [Agent directory structure](../../agents/agents.md#agent-directory-structure).|
| Agent.HomeDirectory | The directory the agent is installed into and contains the agent software. For example: `c:\agent`. For more information about the agent directory structure, see [Agent directory structure](../../agents/agents.md#agent-directory-structure).|
| Agent.Id | The ID of the agent. |
| Agent.JobName | The name of the running job. The name is usually `Job` or `_default`, but in multi-config scenarios, is the configuration. |
| Agent.JobStatus | The status of the build.<br>    <ul>        <li>`Canceled`        <li>`Failed`        <li>`Succeeded`        <li>`SucceededWithIssues` (partially successful)   <li> `Skipped` (last job) </ul>The environment variable should be referenced as `AGENT_JOBSTATUS`. The older `agent.jobstatus` is available for backwards compatibility. |
| Agent.MachineName | The name of the machine on which the agent is installed. |
| Agent.Name | The name of the agent that is registered with the pool. <br><br>If you're using a self-hosted agent, then this name gets set by you. See [agents](../../agents/agents.md). |
| Agent.OS | The operating system of the agent host. Valid values are:<br><ul><li>`Windows_NT`<li>`Darwin`<li>`Linux`</ul>If you're running in a container, the agent host and container might be running different operating systems. |
| Agent.OSArchitecture | The operating system processor architecture of the agent host. Valid values are:<br><ul><li>`X86`<li>`X64`<li>`ARM processor`</ul> |
| Agent.TempDirectory | A temporary folder that is cleaned after each pipeline job. This directory is used by tasks such as <a href="/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/dotnet-core-cli-v2">.NET Core CLI task</a> to hold temporary items like test results before they're published.<br>For example: `/home/vsts/work/_temp` for Ubuntu. |
| Agent.ToolsDirectory | The directory used by tasks such as [Node Tool Installer](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/node-tool-v0) and [Use Python Version](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-python-version-v0) to switch between multiple versions of a tool. <br><br>These tasks add tools from this directory to `PATH` so that subsequent build steps can use them. <br><br>Learn about [managing this directory on a self-hosted agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2008884). |
| Agent.WorkFolder | The working directory for this agent. For example: `c:\agent_work`. <br><br>Note: This directory isn't guaranteed to be writable by pipeline tasks (for example, when mapped into a container). For more information about the agent directory structure, see [Agent directory structure](../../agents/agents.md#agent-directory-structure).|

## Build variables (DevOps Server 2020)

<a id="build-variables"></a>

When you use a variable in a template that isn't marked as available in templates. The variable doesn't render because its value isn't accessible within the template's scope. 


| Variable | Description | Available in templates? |
|:---------|:------------|:------------------------|
| Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory | The local path on the agent where any artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\a`. For more information about the agent directory structure, see [Agent directory structure](../../agents/agents.md#agent-directory-structure).<br><br>A typical way to use this folder is to publish your build artifacts with the [Copy files](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) and [Publish build artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1) tasks. <br><br>Note: Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory are interchangeable. This directory is purged before each new build, so you don't have to clean it up yourself. <br><br> See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md). <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.BuildId | The ID of the record for the completed build. | No |
| Build.BuildNumber | The name of the completed build, also known as the run number. You can specify [what is included](../../process/run-number.md) in this value. <br><br>A typical use of this variable is to make it part of the label format, which you specify on the [repository tab](../../repos/index.md). <br><br>Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the [label format](../../../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md) fails. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.BuildUri | The URI for the build. For example: `vstfs:///Build/Build/1430`. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.BinariesDirectory | The local path on the agent you can use as an output folder for compiled binaries. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\b`. For more information about the agent directory structure, see [Agent directory structure](../../agents/agents.md#agent-directory-structure).<br><br>By default, new build pipelines aren't set up to clean this directory. You can define your build to clean it up on the [Repository tab](../../repos/index.md). <br><br> <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.ContainerId | The ID of the container for your artifact. When you upload an artifact in your pipeline, it's added to a container that is specific for that particular artifact. | No |
| Build.DefinitionName | The name of the build pipeline. <br><br>Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the [label format](../../../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md) fails. | Yes |
| Build.DefinitionVersion | The version of the build pipeline. | Yes |
| Build.QueuedBy | See [How are the identity variables set?](#identity_values). <br><br>Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the [label format](../../../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md) fails. | Yes |
| Build.QueuedById | See [How are the identity variables set?](#identity_values). | Yes |

| Build.Repository.Clean | The value you selected for **Clean** in the [source repository settings](../../repos/index.md). <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.Repository.LocalPath | The local path on the agent where your source code files are downloaded. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\s`. <br><br>By default, new build pipelines update only the changed files. You can modify how files are downloaded on the [Repository tab](../../repos/index.md). <br><br>Important note: If you check out only one Git repository, this path is the exact path to the code. <br><br>If you check out multiple repositories, the behavior is as follows (and might differ from the value of the Build.SourcesDirectory variable):<br><ul><li>If the checkout step for the self (primary) repository has no custom checkout path defined, or the checkout path is the multi-checkout default path `$(Pipeline.Workspace)/s/&lt;RepoName&gt;` for the self repository, the value of this variable reverts to its default value, which is `$(Pipeline.Workspace)/s`.</li><li>If the checkout step for the self (primary) repository has a custom checkout path defined and it's not its multi-checkout default path, this variable contains the exact path to the self repository.</li></ul>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |

It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.Repository.Tfvc.Workspace | Defined if your [repository](../../repos/index.md) is Team Foundation Version Control. The name of the [TFVC workspace](../../../repos/tfvc/create-work-workspaces.md) used by the build agent. <br><br>For example, if the Agent.BuildDirectory is `c:\agent_work\12` and the Agent.Id is `8`, the workspace name could be: `ws_12_8`. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Build.Repository.Uri | The URL for the triggering repository. For example:<br><ul><li>Git: [https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamfiber/_git/Scripts](https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamfiber/_git/Scripts)<li>TFVC: [https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamfiber/](https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamfiber/)</ul>This variable can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | Yes |
| Build.RequestedFor | See [How are the identity variables set?](#identity_values). <br><br>Note: This value can contain whitespace or other invalid label characters. In these cases, the [label format](../../../repos/tfvc/labels-command.md) fails. | Yes |
| Build.RequestedForEmail | See [How are the identity variables set?](#identity_values). | Yes |
| Build.RequestedForId | See [How are the identity variables set?](#identity_values). | Yes |
| Build.SourceBranch | The branch of the triggering repo the build was queued for. Some examples:<br><ul><li>Git repo branch: `refs/heads/main`</li><li>Git repo pull request: `refs/pull/1/merge`</li><li>TFVC repo branch: `$/teamproject/main`</li><li>TFVC repo gated check-in: `Gated_2016-06-06_05.20.51.4369;username@live.com`</li><li>TFVC repo shelveset build: `myshelveset;username@live.com`</li><li>When a tag triggers your pipeline: `refs/tags/your-tag-name`</li></ul>When you use this variable in your build number format, the forward slash characters (`/`) are replaced with underscore characters `_`). <br><br>Note: In TFVC, if you're running a gated check-in build or manually building a shelveset, you can't use this variable in your build number format. | Yes |
| Build.SourceBranchName | The name of the branch in the triggering repo the build was queued for.<br><ul><li>Git repo branch, pull request, or tag: The last path segment in the ref. For example, in `refs/heads/main` this value is `main`. In `refs/heads/feature/tools`, this value is `tools`. In `refs/tags/your-tag-name`, this value is `your-tag-name`.</li><li>TFVC repo branch: The last path segment in the root server path for the workspace. For example, in `$/teamproject/main` this value is `main`.</li><li>TFVC repo gated check-in or shelveset build is the name of the shelveset. For example, `Gated_2016-06-06_05.20.51.4369;username@live.com` or `myshelveset;username@live.com`.</li></ul>Note: In TFVC, if you're running a gated check-in build or manually building a shelveset, you can't use this variable in your build number format. | Yes |
| Build.SourcesDirectory | The local path on the agent where your source code files are downloaded. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\s`. For more information about the agent directory structure, see [Agent directory structure](../../agents/agents.md#agent-directory-structure).<br><br>By default, new build pipelines update only the changed files. <br><br>Important note: If you check out only one Git repository, this path is the exact path to the code. If you check out multiple repositories, it reverts to its default value, which is `$(Pipeline.Workspace)/s`, even if the self (primary) repository is checked out to a custom path different from its multi-checkout default path `$(Pipeline.Workspace)/s/<RepoName>` (in this respect, the variable differs from the behavior of the Build.Repository.LocalPath variable). <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |

It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. <br><br>Also, this variable is only available on the step level. It isn't available in the job or stage levels. That is, the message isn't extracted until the job starts and checks out the code. <br><br>Note: The **Build.SourceVersionMessage** variable doesn't work with classic build pipelines in Bitbucket repositories when **Batch changes while a build is in progress** is enabled. | No |
| Build.StagingDirectory | The local path on the agent where any artifacts are copied to before being pushed to their destination. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\a`. <br><br>A typical way to use this folder is to publish your build artifacts with the [Copy files](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/copy-files-v2) and [Publish build artifacts](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/publish-build-artifacts-v1) tasks. <br><br>Note: Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory and Build.StagingDirectory are interchangeable. This directory is purged before each new build, so you don&#39;t have to clean it up yourself. <br><br> See [Artifacts in Azure Pipelines](../../artifacts/artifacts-overview.md). <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task.

| Build.TriggeredBy.BuildId | If [another build triggers](../../process/pipeline-triggers.md) the build, then this variable is set to the BuildID of the triggering build. In Classic pipelines, a build completion trigger triggers this variable. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag.  | No |
| Build.TriggeredBy.DefinitionId | If [another build triggers](../../process/pipeline-triggers.md) the build, then this variable is set to the DefinitionID of the triggering build.

It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag.  | No |
| Build.TriggeredBy.ProjectID | If [another build triggers](../../process/pipeline-triggers.md) the build, then this variable is set to ID of the project that contains the triggering build. In Classic pipelines, a build completion trigger triggers this variable. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
| Common.TestResultsDirectory | The local path on the agent where the test results are created. For example: `c:\agent_work\1\TestResults`.

This variable is only available in a YAML pipeline if a branch policy affects the PR. | No |
| System.PullRequest.targetBranchName | The name of the target branch for a pull request. This variable can be used in a pipeline to conditionally execute tasks or steps based on the target branch of the pull request. For example, you might want to trigger a different set of tests or code analysis tools depending on the branch that the changes are being merged into. | No |
| System.PullRequest.SourceBranch | The branch that is being reviewed in a pull request. For example: `refs/heads/users/raisa/new-feature`. (This variable is initialized only if the build ran because of a [Git PR affected by a branch policy](../../../repos/git/branch-policies.md#build-validation)). This variable is only available in a YAML pipeline if a branch policy affects the PR. | No |
| System.PullRequest.SourceCommitId | The commit that is being reviewed in a pull request.

For example: `https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamfiber/`. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | Yes |
| System.TeamProject | The name of the project that contains this build. | Yes |
| System.TeamProjectId | The ID of the project that this build belongs to. | Yes |
| TF_BUILD | Set to `True` if a build task runs the script. <br><br>This variable is agent-scoped, and can be used as an environment variable in a script and as a parameter in a build task. It can't be used as part of the build number or as a version control tag. | No |
