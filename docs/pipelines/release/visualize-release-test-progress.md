### Pre-deployment and post-deployment

If pre-deployment or post-deployment conditions have been set for an environment, it is indicated on the environment with the presence of the approvals and gates. The progress of approvals and gates show up in the status of the environment as well. You can take action or view further details by clicking on the environment’s condition icon displayed on the right or left side of the environment.

## Review test summary

During test execution, a test might spawn multiple instances of tests that contribute to the overall outcome. A few examples include: tests that rerun due to failures, tests composed of an ordered combination of other tests (for example, ordered test), or tests having different instances based on provided input parameter (data-driven tests). Since these tests are related, they need to be reported together with the overall outcome derived based on the individual test outcomes. The summary page provides insights on the result of the test runs related to your pipeline.

> [!NOTE]
> Metrics in the test summary section (e.g. Total tests, Passed, etc.), are computed using the root level of the hierarchy rather than each individual iteration of the tests.
