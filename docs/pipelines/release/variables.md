# Classic release and artifacts variables

Classic release and artifacts variables are a convenient way to exchange and transport data throughout your pipeline. Each variable is stored as a string and its value can change between runs of your pipeline.

Variables are different from [Runtime parameters](../process/runtime-parameters.md) which are only available at template parsing time.

> [!NOTE] 
> This is a reference article that covers the classic release and artifacts variables. To understand variables in YAML pipelines, see [user-defined variables](../process/variables.md).

As you compose the tasks for deploying your application into each stage in your DevOps CI/CD processes, variables will help you to:

* Define a more generic deployment pipeline once, and then
customize it easily for each stage. For example, a variable
can be used to represent the connection string for web deployment,
and the value of this variable can be changed from one stage
to another. These are **custom variables**.

* Use information about the context of the particular release,
[stage](../process/stages.md), [artifacts](artifacts.md), or
[agent](../agents/agents.md) in which the deployment pipeline is
being run. For example, your script may need access to the location
of the build to download it, or to the working directory on the
agent to create temporary files. These are **default variables**.

> [!TIP]
> You can view the [current values of all variables](#view-vars) for a release,
and use a default variable to [run a release in debug mode](#debug-mode).

## Default variables

Information about the execution context is made available to running tasks through default variables. Your tasks and scripts can use these variables to find information about the system, release, stage, or agent they are running in.
With the exception of **System.Debug**, these variables are read-only and their values are automatically set by the system.
Some of the most significant variables are described in the following tables.
To view the full list, see [View the current values of all variables](#view-vars).

## Default variables - General Artifact

For each artifact that is referenced in a release, you can use the following artifact variables.
Not all variables are meaningful for each artifact type. The table below lists the default artifact
variables and provides examples of the values that they have depending on the artifact type. If an example is empty,
it implies that the variable is not populated for that artifact type.

Replace the `{alias}` placeholder with the value you specified for the [artifact alias](artifacts.md#source-alias) or with the default value generated for the release pipeline.

| Variable name | Description |

## Default variables - Primary Artifact

You designate one of the artifacts as a primary artifact in a release pipeline. For the designated primary artifact, Azure Pipelines populates the following variables.

| Variable name | Same as |
|---------------|---------|
| Build.DefinitionId | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.DefinitionId |
| Build.DefinitionName | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.DefinitionName |
| Build.BuildNumber | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.BuildNumber |
| Build.BuildId | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.BuildId |
| Build.BuildURI | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.BuildURI |
| Build.SourceBranch | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.SourceBranch |
| Build.SourceBranchName | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.SourceBranchName |
| Build.SourceVersion | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.SourceVersion |
| Build.Repository.Provider | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.Repository.Provider |
| Build.RequestedForID | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.RequestedForID |
| Build.RequestedFor | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.RequestedFor |
| Build.Type | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.Type |
| Build.PullRequest.TargetBranch | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.PullRequest.TargetBranch |
| Build.PullRequest.TargetBranchName | Release.Artifacts.{Primary artifact alias}.PullRequest.TargetBranchName |

## Using default variables

You can use the default variables in two ways - as parameters to tasks in a release pipeline or in your scripts.

You can directly use a default variable as an input to a task.
For example, to pass `Release.Artifacts.{Artifact alias}.DefinitionName` for the artifact source whose alias is **ASPNET4.CI** to a task,
you would use `$(Release.Artifacts.ASPNET4.CI.DefinitionName)`.

![Using artifact variables in arguments to a PowerShell Script task](media/variables-01.png)

To use a default variable in your script, you must first replace the `.` in the default variable names with `_`.
For example, to print the value of artifact variable `Release.Artifacts.{Artifact alias}.DefinitionName` for the artifact source whose alias is **ASPNET4.CI** in a PowerShell script,
you would use `$env:RELEASE_ARTIFACTS_ASPNET4_CI_DEFINITIONNAME`.

![Using artifact variables in an inline PowerShell script](media/variables-02.png)

Note that the original name of the artifact source alias, `ASPNET4.CI`, is replaced by `ASPNET4_CI`.

### View the current values of all variables

1. Open the pipelines view of the summary for the release, and choose the stage you are interested in.
   In the list of steps, choose **Initialize job**.

   ![Opening the log for a release](media/view-variable-values-link.png)

1. This opens the log for this step. Scroll down to see the values used by the agent for this job.   

   ![Viewing the values of the variables in a release](media/view-variable-values.png)

<a name="debug-mode"></a>

### Run a release in debug mode

Show additional information as a release executes and in the log files
by running the entire release, or just the tasks in an individual
release stage, in debug mode. This can help you resolve issues and failures.

* To initiate debug mode for an entire release, add a variable
  named `System.Debug` with the value `true` to the **Variables**
  tab of a release pipeline.

* To initiate debug mode for a single stage, open the
  **Configure stage** dialog from the shortcut menu
  of the stage and add a variable named `System.Debug`
  with the value `true` to the **Variables** tab.

* Alternatively, create a [variable group](../library/variable-groups.md)
  containing a variable named `System.Debug` with the value `true`
  and link this variable group to a release pipeline.

> [!TIP]
> If you get an error related to an Azure RM service connection,
see [How to: Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service connections](azure-rm-endpoint.md).

## Custom variables

Custom variables can be defined at various scopes.

* Share values across all of the definitions
  in a project by using [variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md). Choose a variable
  group when you need to use the same values across all
  the definitions, stages,   and tasks in a project, and you want to be able to change
  the values in a single place. You define and manage variable groups in the **Library** tab.

* Share values across all of the stages by using
  **release pipeline variables**. Choose a release pipeline
  variable when you need to use the same value across all
  the stages and tasks in the release pipeline, and you
  want to be able to change the value in a single place.
  You define and manage these variables in the **Variables** tab in a release pipeline.
  In the Pipeline Variables page, open the Scope drop-down list and select "Release".
  By default, when you add a variable, it is set to Release scope.  

* Share values across all of the tasks within one specific stage by using **stage variables**.
  Use a stage-level variable for values that vary from stage to stage (and are the same for
  all the tasks in an stage). You define and manage these variables in the **Variables** tab of a release pipeline.
  In the Pipeline Variables page, open the Scope drop-down list and select the required stage.
  When you add a variable, set the Scope to the appropriate environment.
  
Using custom variables at project, release pipeline, and stage scope helps you to:

* Avoid duplication of values, making it easier to update
  all occurrences as one operation.

* Store sensitive values in a way that they cannot be seen
  or changed by users of the release pipelines. Designate a  configuration property to be a secure (secret) variable by selecting the ![padlock](media/padlock-icon.png) (padlock) icon next to the variable.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The values of the hidden (secret) variables are securely stored on
  the server and cannot be viewed by users after they are saved.
  During a deployment, the Azure Pipelines release service
  decrypts these values when referenced by the tasks and passes them
  to the agent over a secure HTTPS channel.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating custom variables can overwrite standard variables. For example, the PowerShell **Path** environment variable. If you create a custom `Path` variable on a Windows agent, it will overwrite the `$env:Path` variable and PowerShell won't be able to run.

## Using custom variables

To use custom variables in your build and release tasks, simply enclose the 
variable name in parentheses and precede it with a **$** character. For example,
if you have a variable named **adminUserName**, you can insert the current
value of that variable into a parameter of a task as `$(adminUserName)`.
