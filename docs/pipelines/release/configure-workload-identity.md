# Manually set an Azure Resource Manager workload identity service connection

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

> [!NOTE]
>We are rolling out the new Azure service connection creation experience. Receiving it in your organization depends on various factors, and you may still see the older user experience.

When you [troubleshoot an Azure Resource Manager workload identity service connection](troubleshoot-workload-identity.md#i-dont-have-permissions-to-create-a-service-principal-in-the-microsoft-entra-tenant), you might need to manually configure the connection instead of using the automated tool that's available in Azure DevOps.

We recommend that you [try the automated approach](../library/connect-to-azure.md#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-that-uses-workload-identity-federation) before you begin a manual configuration.

There are two options for authentication: use a managed identity or use an app registration. The advantage of the managed identity option is that you can use it if you don't have permissions to create service principals or if you're using a different Microsoft Entra tenant than your Azure DevOps user.

## Set a workload identity service connection 

#### [Managed identity](#tab/managed-identity)

<a name="set-a-workload-identity-service-connection-to-use-managed-identity-authentication"></a>

To manually set up managed identity authentication for your Azure Pipelines, follow these steps to create a managed identity in the Azure portal, establish a service connection in Azure DevOps, add federated credentials, and grant the necessary permissions. You'll need to follow these steps in this order:

1. Create the managed identity in Azure portal. 
1. Create the service connection in Azure DevOps and save as a draft. 
1. Add a federated credential to your managed identity in Azure portal.
1. Grant permissions to the managed identity in Azure portal.
1. Save your service connection in Azure DevOps.

You can also use the REST API for this process.

### Prerequisites for managed identity authentication

- To create a user-assigned managed identity, your Azure account needs the [Managed Identity Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/identity#managed-identity-contributor) or higher role assignment.
- To use a managed identity to access Azure resources in your pipeline, [assign the managed identity access to the resource](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-assign-access-azure-resource).  


### Create a managed identity in Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **Managed Identities**.

1. Select **Create**.

1. In the **Create User Assigned Managed Identity** pane, enter or select values for the following items:

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription in which to create the user-assigned managed identity.
    - **Resource group**: Select a resource group to create the user-assigned managed identity in, or select **Create new** to create a new resource group.
    - **Region**: Select a region to deploy the user-assigned managed identity (example: **East US**).
    - **Name**: Enter the name for your user-assigned managed identity (example: **UADEVOPS**).

1. Select **Review + create** to create a new managed identity. When your deployment is complete, select **Go to resource**. 

1. Copy the **Subscription**, **Subscription ID**, and **Client ID**  values for your managed identity to use later.

1. Within your managed identity in Azure portal, go to **Settings** > **Properties**.

1. Copy the **Tenant Id** value to use later.

### Create a service connection for managed identity authentication in Azure DevOps

1. In Azure DevOps, open your project and go to :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/gear-icon.png" border="false"::: > **Pipelines** > **Service connections**.

1. Select **New service connection**.

1. Select **Azure Resource Manager**.

1. Select identity type **App registration or Managed identity (manual)** the **Workload identity federation** credential.

    :::image type="content" source="media/workload-identity-manual-app-workload.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the Workload Identity service connection for managed identity.":::

1. For **Service connection name**, enter a value such as `uamanagedidentity`. You'll use this value in your federated credential subject identifier.

1. Select **Next**.

1. In **Step 2: App registration details**:

    **Step 2: App registration details** contains the following parameters. You can enter or select the following parameters:

   | Parameter | Description |

#### [App registration](#tab/app-registration)

<a name="app-registration-workload-identity"></a>

This section guides you through setting up an app registration and federated credentials in the Azure portal, creating a service connection for service principal authentication in Azure DevOps, adding federated credentials to your app registration, and granting the necessary permissions. The app registration uses service principal authentication. You'll need to complete these steps in the following order:

1. Create the app registration with service principal authentication in Azure portal. 
1. Create the service connection in Azure DevOps and save as a draft. 
1. Add a federated credential to your app registration in Azure portal.
1. Grant permissions to the app registration in Azure portal.
1. Save your service connection in Azure DevOps.

You can also use the REST API for this process.
