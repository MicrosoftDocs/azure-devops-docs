# Stage templates

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Pipelines provide a list of stage templates you can choose from when creating a new release pipeline or adding a stage to your existing one. The templates are predefined with the appropriate tasks and settings to help you save time and effort when creating your release pipeline.

Aside from the predefined templates, you can also create your own custom stage templates based on your specific needs.

When a stage is created from a template, the tasks in the template are copied over to the stage. Any further updates to the template have no impact on existing stages. If you are trying to add multiple stages to your release pipeline and update them all in one operation, you should use [task groups](../library/task-groups.md) instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Templates cannot be restrict to specific users or groups. All templates, predefined or custom, are available to all users who have the permission to create release pipelines.

## FAQs

### Q: Can I export templates or share them with other subscriptions, enterprises, or projects?

Custom templates are scoped to the project that hosts them. Templates cannot be exported or shared with other projects, collections, servers, or organizations.
You can, however, export a release pipeline into another project, collection, server, or subscription and then re-create the template and use it in that new location.

### Q: How do I delete a custom stage template?

Existing custom templates can be deleted from the *Select a Template* window panel. From within your release pipeline definition, select **Add** > **New Stage** to access the list of templates.

### Q: How do I update a custom stage template?

To update a stage template, delete the existing one from the list of templates, and then save the new one with the same name.
