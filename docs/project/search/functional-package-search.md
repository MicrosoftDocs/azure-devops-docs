Package Search is automatically available to users of Azure DevOps.

1. The Views filter only appears if a single feed is selected from Feeds filter. Use the filter to show the selector lists.

	:::image type="content" source="media/shared/pkgsrch-results-filtericon.png" alt-text="Showing the filter lists":::   

2. Select the criteria you want in the selector lists, or search across the entire organization.

	:::image type="content" source="media/shared/pkgsrch-results-filters.png" alt-text="Selector drop-down lists":::

3. By switching pivots, quickly search packages that contain the same search string.

	:::image type="content" source="media/shared/pkgsrch-other.png" alt-text="Search for packages containing the same search string":::

By default, you search within all feeds of the organization, no matter which project you're in. 

The Views filter only appears if a single feed gets selected from the Feeds filter. Use this filter to show the selector lists.

Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **filter** and the function that you want to include in your search string from the list. Then, enter your criteria. 

:::image type="content" source="media/shared/show-filters.png" alt-text="Show filter panel button.":::

Add more criteria to either narrow or broaden your search by using the operators and functions listed in :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/view-options-icon.png" border="false"::: **view options**.
