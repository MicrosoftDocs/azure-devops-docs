# Manage Search indexing

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-azure-devops.md)]

You can manage your search extension and indexing status, which include the following actions:
- [Check indexing status](#check-indexing-status)
- [Pause indexing](#pause-indexing)
- [Resume indexing](#resume-indexing)
- [Reindex a repository or collection](#reindex-a-repository-or-collection)

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Permissions** | Member of the [Project Collection Administrators](../../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md) group. |
| **Tasks** | Complete [Install and configure Search](install-configure-search.md). |

## Manage indexing

Search gets managed by running PowerShell and SQL scripts. All of these scripts are available to download from the **[Code-Search GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Code-Search)**. You can download all scripts into a local folder on the server. This server runs the database for Azure DevOps Server using the **Download ZIP** option. 

The PowerShell scripts require the SQL script files, so ensure the **SqlScripts** folder and its contents are present, along with the PowerShell scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> When you execute scripts, ensure that you run the appropriate script for your version:
> 
> * [TFS 2018 RTM](https://github.com/Microsoft/Code-Search/tree/master/TFS_2018RTW)
> * [TFS 2018 Update 1](https://github.com/Microsoft/Code-Search/tree/master/TFS_2018Update1)
> * [TFS 2018 Update 2](https://github.com/Microsoft/Code-Search/tree/master/TFS_2018Update2)
> * [Azure DevOps Server and TFS 2018 Update 3](https://github.com/Microsoft/Code-Search/tree/master/TFS_2018Update3)

### Check indexing status

To check the indexing status after Search is configured, or after the extension is installed for a collection, do the following steps.

::: moniker range=" azure-devops-2022"

1. Execute the `ExtensionInstallIndexingStatus.ps1` script with **administrative privileges** and enter the following information:

   - The SQL server instance name where the Azure DevOps Server configuration database is located.
   - The name of the Azure DevOps Server collection database.
   - The name of the Azure DevOps Server configuration database.
   - The name of the collection.
   - The number of previous days to check indexing status.
 
2. Review the following outputs:

   - **Collection indexing was triggered successfully:** Indicates that indexing is in progress.
   - **Repositories Indexing Completed:** Lists repositories whose indexing completed and is searchable.
   - **Status of repositories currently indexing:** Lists the names of all the repositories that are still being indexed and are partially searchable. It takes some time for indexing to complete.
 
3. Execute the `RecentIndexingActivity.ps1` script at intervals for indexing progress. This script takes the same parameters as the `ExtensionInstallIndexingStatus.ps1` script:

   - **Repositories completed fresh indexing:** Shows number of repositories for which indexing completed within the specified time interval.
   - **Count of repositories with fresh indexing in progress:**  Shows the number of repositories for which indexing isn't complete. These repositories are still being indexed and are partially searchable.
   - **Repositories completed continuous indexing:**  Shows the number of commits processed in the specified time interval. The number might not exactly match the total number of pushes to the repository because merges are committed as they're indexed.
   - **Count of repositories with continuous indexing in progress:** Shows the number of repositories for which the commits are still being processed. These repositories show incomplete results until indexing is completed.
   - **Count of indexing job failures:**  Shows the number of indexing jobs that failed. Repositories associated with these indexing jobs could potentially show incomplete results until later indexing jobs for the same repositories patched the failed indexing.

1. Execute the `CheckIndexingStatus.ps1` script with **administrative privileges** and enter the following information: 

   - The **SQL server instance name** where the **TFS configuration database** is located.
   - The name of the **TFS collection database**.
   - The name of the **TFS configuration database**.
   - The name of the **collection**.
   - The number of previous days to check indexing status.

2. Review the following outputs:
   - **Collection indexing was triggered successfully:** Indicates that indexing is in progress.
   - **Repositories Indexing Completed:** Lists repositories whose indexing completed and is searchable.
   - **Repositories in File Discovery Phase:** Repositories where files are yet to be discovered. These files are indexed after this stage.
   - **Repositories Indexing In Progress:** Repositories that are partially indexed and should be searchable, even if the results are only partial. It might take some time for indexing to complete.

3. Monitor progress:
   1. Execute the `CheckIndexingStatus.ps1` script at intervals for indexing progress.
   2. If indexing isnâ€™t working or if the number of pending files doesn't change for some time, execute the `TriggerCollectionIndexing.ps1` script with administrative permission.

### Pause indexing

To pause all indexing, execute: `PauseSearchIndexing.ps1`, which is useful if you see spikes in CPU utilization after configuring Search. You're prompted to enter the following information.
* The SQL server instance name where the Azure DevOps Server configuration database is
* The name of the Azure DevOps Server configuration database

### Resume indexing

If you paused indexing, execute: `ResumeIndexing.ps1` to start again. You're prompted to enter the following information.
* The SQL server instance name where the Azure DevOps Server configuration database is
* The name of the Azure DevOps Server configuration database

### Reindex a repository or collection

To reindex a Git or TFVC repository, execute the appropriate
version of the script, `Re-IndexingRepository.ps1`, for your Azure DevOps Server version. 
You're prompted to enter the following information.

* The SQL server instance name where the Azure DevOps Server configuration database is
* The name of the Azure DevOps Server collection database
* The name of the Azure DevOps Server configuration database
* The type of reindexing to execute, either `Git\_Repository` or `TFVC\_Repository`
* The name of the collection
* The name of the repository to reindex

To reindex a **collection**, execute the script: `TriggerCollectionIndexing.ps1`.
You're prompted to enter the following information.
* The SQL server instance name where the Azure DevOps Server configuration database is
* The name of the Azure DevOps Server collection database
* The name of the Azure DevOps Server configuration database
* The name of the collection
* The entities to reindex, either `All`, `Code`, `WorkItem`, or `Wiki`

## Search limitations

If you do a disaster recovery (DR) operation and move your server back to an earlier snapshot of your SQL database, [reindex all your collections](manage-search.md#reindex-a-repository-or-collection).
