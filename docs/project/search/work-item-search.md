# Search for work items

[!INCLUDE [version-header](_shared/version-header.md)]

Work Item Search provides fast and flexible search across all your work items over all your projects.

<a name="start-search"></a>

## Start searching

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

1. Open the **Azure Boards** section in Azure DevOps (see [Web portal navigation](../navigation/index.md)).

1. Choose the ![start search icon](_img/_shared/start-search-icon-new.png) icon at the top right of the window to show the search textbox.

1. Enter a search string in the textbox, and press _Enter_ (or choose the 
   ![start search icon](_img/_shared/start-search-icon-new.png) icon) to start your search. 

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

1. In the search textbox at the top right of the window, check that the text says
   _Search work items_.

1. If you have the Code Search extension installed, the search text box may
   say _Search code_. In this case, use the drop-down selector to change it. 

1. Enter a search string in the textbox, and press _Enter_ (or choose the 
   ![start search icon](_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) icon) to start your search.

## View the results

1. Search results are displayed in a snippet view, where matches found are shown in bold.

   ![Search results](_img/work-item-search-get-started/results-matching.png)

   This is a full text search that uses simple search strings for words or phrases.
   Work item search matches derived forms of your search terms; for example, a search for
   "updating" will also find instances of the word "updated" and "update". Note that searches are _not_ case-sensitive.

1. Select a snippet of a work item to display it in the right window. 
   You can edit and manage this work item in the usual way.

   ![Display a work item](_img/work-item-search-get-started/search-results-02.png)

   > Open the search results in a new browser tab from a search box by
   pressing _Ctrl_ + _Enter_ or by holding _Ctrl_ and clicking  the
   ![start search icon](_img/_shared/start-search-icon-new.png) icon.
   In Google Chrome or Firefox, press _Ctrl_ + _Shift_ + _Enter_ to switch the focus
   to the new browser tab. 

1. Fine tune your search by specifying the fields to search. Enter `a:` and a user name
   to search for all items assigned to that user.

   ![Static drop down](_img/work-item-search-get-started/static-dropdown.png)    

   The quick filters you can use are:

   * `a:` for **Assigned to:** 
   * `c:` for **Created by:** 
   * `s:` for **State** 
   * `t:` for **Work item type**<p />
 
1. Start typing the name of a field in your work items; for example, type `ta`.

   ![Quick filters as you type](_img/work-item-search-get-started/dyna-dropdown.png)    

   The dropdown list shows work item field name suggestions 
   that match user input thereby helping the user to complete the search faster. For example, a search such as 
   **tags:Critical** finds all work items tagged 'Critical'. 

1. Add more filters to further narrow your search, and use Boolean operators
   to combine terms if required. For example, 
   **a: Chris t: Bug s: Active** finds all active bugs assigned
   to a user named Chris.

1. Widen your search across all projects, or narrow it to specific types
   and states. Use the "filter" icon to show the selector lists.

   ![Showing the filter lists](_img/_shared/show-filters.png)    

1. Select the criteria you want in the drop-down selector lists, or search across the entire organization.

   ![Selector drop-down lists](_img/work-item-search-get-started/area-selectors.png)    

1. Sort the results as you need using the drop-down list of field names, work item types, or by relevance.

   ![Sort drop-down list](_img/work-item-search-get-started/sort-order.png)    

1. Quickly [search for code](code-search.md) containing the same search string, or search for the same string in your [project's wiki](../wiki/search-wiki.md).
