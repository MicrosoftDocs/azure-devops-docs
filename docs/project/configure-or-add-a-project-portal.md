# Configure or add a project portal

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

The project portal is a site associated with a team project for the purposes of sharing information. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Configuring the project portal and process guidance features have been deprecated. You can only set them from Visual Studio 2017 or earlier versions and when connected to TFS 2017 or earlier versions. SharePoint integration with Azure DevOps (formerly named Team Foundation Server) was deprecated with the release of TFS 2018. For TFS 2018 and later versions, you can use the built-in wiki feature to share information, guidance, and documents. To learn more, see [About Wikis, READMEs, and Markdown](./wiki/about-readme-wiki.md).
