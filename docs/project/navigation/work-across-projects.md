# Work across projects

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)] 

When you work on several projects, you can use select pages to support your cross-project work. These pages provide quick access and filter functions to support your work within a single project or work you're doing across several projects.  

For example, you can quickly access and navigate to the following artifacts defined across projects.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
- **Projects**: Projects defined for an organization in Azure DevOps
- **Work items**: Work items assigned to you
- **Pull requests**: Pull requests you've initiated or that are relevant to you across all team projects you work in
- **Favorites**: Artifacts&mdash;such as projects, teams, repositories, shared queries, and more &mdash;that you've favorited

::: moniker-end  


::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
- **Projects**: Team projects and teams within the projects that you work in  
- **Favorites**: Items&mdash;such as build definitions, repositories, shared queries, and more &mdash;that you've favorited  
- **Work items**: Work items assigned to you, that you're following, or that you've recently viewed or updated  
- **Pull requests**: Pull requests you've initiated or that are relevant to you across all team projects you work in   

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"
- **Projects**: Team projects and teams within the projects that you work in  
- **Favorites**: Items&mdash;such as build definitions, repositories, shared queries, and more &mdash;that you've favorited  
- **Work items**: Work items assigned to you, that you're following, or that you've recently viewed or updated  
- **Pull requests**: Pull requests you've initiated or that are relevant to you across all team projects you work in   
- **Rooms**: Team rooms you use to collaborate with other team members.  

> [!NOTE]  
> The features described in this article require TFS 2017.1 and later versions. To upgrade to TFS 2017.1, go to the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs).  

::: moniker-end

To switch to another project, see [Switch project, repository, or team](go-to-project-repo.md). 


## View and open work items

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

To view work items assigned to you across projects, choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/inbox.png) inbox icon, and then choosing **Work Items**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![View work assigned to you across projects](_img/projects-page/view-work-across-projects.png) 

To view work items assigned to you for a specific project, [open **Work>Work Items>Assigned to Me**](../../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md). 


::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"

Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to open **Projects**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open Projects page](../../_shared/_img/settings/open-project-hub-horz.png)   

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
Choose **Work items** to access the set of work items assigned to you or followed by you. The lists available from each page span all team projects that you work in.

The **Assigned to me** page lists all work items assigned to you in the order they were last updated. To open or update a work item, choose its title.

![Account home, Work, Assigned to me page](_img/org-hub-tfs/account-home-work-assigned-to-me.png) 

::: moniker-end

### Work you're following

Choose **Following** to open the page that lists all the work items [you've marked to follow](../../boards/work-items/follow-work-items.md). To stop following an item and remove it from your list, choose the ![followed icon](../../_img/icons/icon-followed.png) following icon.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Account home, Work, Following page](_img/projects-page/account-home-work-following.png)  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
![Account home, Work, Assigned to me page](_img/org-hub-tfs/account-home-work-followed.png) 
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
### My activity

Choose **My activity** to open the page that lists all work items that you have recently viewed or updated.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Account home, Work items, My Activity page](_img/projects-page/account-work-my-activity.png) 

::: moniker-end 

### Filter the list of work items

Similar to the Favorites page, you can filter the work pages by typing a keyword in the *Filter your work items...* box. The list will filter based on keyword matches to the work item ID, title, state, or team project name.

## View and open pull requests

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

To view pull requests you created  or that are assigned to you across projects, choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/inbox.png) inbox icon, and then choosing **Pull requests**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![View pull requests assigned to you across projects](_img/projects-page/view-pull-requests-vert.png) 

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"

Open the **Projects>Pull requests** page to access any pull request that's relevant to you across all projects you work in. Choose **Active** or **Completed** to pivot between the active or completed set of pull requests. To initiate a pull request, choose **New pull request**.

![Account home, Pull requests, Active](_img/org-hub-tfs/account-home-pull-requests.png) 

From each page, you're one choice away from navigating to the branch or repository for a pull request. This mirrors capabilities on the  project **Code>Pull Requests** page.

### Filter the list of pull requests

Similar to the Favorites page, you can filter the list by typing a keyword in the *Filter pull requests* box.

::: moniker-end


## View and open favorites 

You can view favorites you've set across projects. To learn more about working with favorites, see [Set personal or team favorites](set-favorites.md).

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 

Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/inbox.png) inbox icon, and then choosing **Favorites**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![View your favorited items](_img/favorites/open-favorites-page-vnav.png) 

::: moniker-end  


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
Open the **Favorites** page to quickly access any object or item that you've marked as a favorite.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Account home favorites page](_img/projects-page/account-home-favorites.png)

To learn more about working with favorites, see [Set personal and team favorites](set-favorites.md). 

### Favorite and unfavorite an item

To mark any item as a favorite, choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/icon-favorite-star.png) star icon next to the object. 

To remove an item from your favorites list, choose the favorited icon.

![Account home favorites page](_img/projects-page/account-home-remove-from-favorites.png)

### Filter the list of favorites

To filter the list, type a keyword in the *Filter favorites* box. The list will filter based on keyword matches to the title or team project name associated with the favorited item.

## Open a team room

To open a team room, choose **Projects>Rooms**. You'll see all the team rooms defined for collection of projects. Choose the name of a team room which you have access. You only have access to those team rooms of which you are a team member.  

![Account home, Rooms, selected team room](_img/projects-page/account-home-rooms.png)  

To learn more about team rooms, see [Collaborate in a team room](../../notifications/collaborate-in-a-team-room.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> Team Rooms are no longer supported for TFS 2018 and later versions as described in [Deprecation of Team Rooms](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/01/04/deprecation-of-the-team-rooms-in-team-services-and-tfs/) blog post. Several good solutions are available that integrate well with TFS that support notifications and chat, such as [Microsoft Teams](../../service-hooks/services/teams.md) and [Slack](../../service-hooks/services/slack.md).
