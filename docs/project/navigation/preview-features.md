# Manage preview features 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

As some new features get introduced, you can turn them on or off. You can try them out, provide feedback, and work with the ones that meet your requirements. Some preview features provide access to new functionality, while others reflect a change to the user interface, but little or no change in functionality. 

> [!NOTE]   
> It might take up to three weeks after a release to Azure DevOps for the preview feature to appear in your organization. The [latest release notes](/azure/devops/release-notes/features-timeline) usually provide information on new preview features. You can turn on or off select features for Azure DevOps. Preview features become available first on Azure DevOps Services and then become standard features with an update to Azure DevOps Server. At some point, the preview feature moves out of preview status and becomes a regular feature of the web portal.

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Project access** | Member of the [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md) where you want to enable or disable preview features. |
| **Permissions** | To enable or disable preview features for your organization: Member of the **Project Administrators** group. |

:::image type="content" source="media/preview-features/manage-preview-features.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Preview features options and dropdown menu for either personal or organizational settings.":::

Enabling a feature at the organization level activates it for all users. They can still turn it off individually. Disabling a feature at the organization level doesn’t affect user settings. Users can change feature status on their own. For more information, see [Set user preferences](../../organizations/settings/set-your-preferences.md).

> [!TIP]  
> If you don't see the **for this account** menu option, then you aren't a member of the Project Collection Administrators group. To get added as one, see [Change project collection-level permissions](../../organizations/security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md).  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

1. Open your profile menu by choosing your image icon and select **Manage features**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-features/open-profile-2020.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Open profile menu, Azure DevOps Server 2020.":::

2. Select the level from the menu provided. 

	> [!TIP]  
	> If you don't see the **for this project** or **for this collection** menu options, then you aren't an administrator. To get added as one, see [Change project collection-level permissions](../../organizations/security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md).  

3. To turn on or off a feature, choose the slider. 

	**User-level**  
	:::image type="content" source="media/manage-features/manage-features-user-2020.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Manage features for the user.":::

	**Project-level**  
	:::image type="content" source="media/manage-features/manage-features-project-2020.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Manage features for the project.":::

	**Collection-level**  
	:::image type="content" source="media/manage-features/manage-features-collection-2020.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Manage features for the collection.":::

When you turn on a feature at the project or collection-level, you turn it on for all users. If you turn off a feature at the project or collection-level, user settings aren't changed. Users can change feature status on their own.

## Transition of Preview Features to General Availability

While there's no fixed timeline for when a preview feature moves to general availability (GA), there are several indicators and resources you can use to stay informed about the status of preview features:

- **Azure DevOps roadmap and release notes:** The Azure DevOps roadmap provides insights into upcoming features and enhancements. It includes information about features currently in preview and their expected release timelines. Azure DevOps release notes provide detailed information about new features, improvements, and bug fixes. For more information, see the Relevant Links section at [Azure DevOps Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/). 
- **Azure DevOps blog:** The Azure DevOps blog often features posts about new releases, including when preview features transition to GA. Subscribing to the blog or regularly checking it can help you stay updated. For more information, see [Azure DevOps Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/).
