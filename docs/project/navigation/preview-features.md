# Manage or enable features 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)] 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

As new features are introduced, you can turn them on or off. That way, you can try them out, provide feedback, and work with the ones that meet your requirements.  

Some preview features provide access to entire new functionality. Others, such as the New Wiki experience, reflect a change to the user interface, but little or no change in functionality. 

> [!NOTE]   
> It may take up to three weeks after a release to Azure DevOps Services for the preview feature to appear in your organization. The [latest release notes](/azure/devops/release-notes/features-timeline) usually provide information on new preview features. You can turn on or off select features for Azure DevOps Services. Preview features become available first on Azure DevOps Services and then become standard features with an update to Azure DevOps Server. At some point, the preview feature moves out of preview status and becomes a regular feature of the web portal.

## Enable features for your use  

From time to time, a new feature is introduced in Preview mode, which allows you to turn it on or off.

To enable or disable a feature, slide the toggle to the **on** or **off** position.

For more information, see [Set user preferences](../../organizations/settings/set-your-preferences.md).

## Enable features at the organization level 

When you enable a feature at the organization level, you essentially turn it on for all users of your account. Each user can then disable the feature if they so choose. If you disable a feature at the organization level, user settings aren't changed. Users can enable or disable the feature on their own.
