# Web portal navigation   

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)] 

::: moniker range="vsts"
The web portal for Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server (TFS) is organized around a set of services, as well as administrative pages and several task-specific features such as the search box.  The service labels differ depending on the navigation selected: 
- **New navigation**: **Overview**, **Boards**, **Repos**, **Pipelines**, **Test Plans**, and **Artifacts**
- **Previous navigation**: **Dashboards**, **Code**, **Work**, **Build and Release**, **Test**, **Wiki**, and **Analytics views**

Each service provides you with one or more pages which support a number of features and functional tasks. Within a page, you may then have a choice of options to select a specific artifact or add an artifact.

Here's what you need to know to get up and running using the web portal.  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)
::: moniker range="vsts"
- [**Open a service, page, or settings**](go-to-service-page.md): use to switch to a different [service or functional area](../../user-guide/services.md) 
- [**Add an artifact or team**](add-artifact-team.md): use to quickly add a work item, Git repo, build or release pipelines, or a new team
- [**Open another project or repo**](work-across-projects.md): use to switch to a different project or access work items and pull requests defined in different projects, or items you've favorited 
- [**Open team artifacts, use breadcrumbs & selectors**](use-breadcrumbs-selectors.md): use to navigate within a service, to open other artifacts or return to a root function
- [**Work with favorites**](set-favorites.md): favorite artifacts to support quick navigation   
- [**Search box**](search-basics.md): use to find code, work items, or wiki content 
- [**Your profile menu**](../../organizations/settings/set-your-preferences.md?toc=/azure/devops/project/navigation/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/project/navigation/breadcrumb/toc.json): use to set personal preferences, notifications, and enable preview features  
- [**Settings**](../../organizations/settings/index.md): use to add teams, manage security, and configure other project and organization-level resources.

> [!NOTE]  
> Only those services that are enabled will appear in the user interface. For example, if **Boards** is disabled, then **Boards** or **Work** and all pages associated with that service won't appear. To enable or disable a service, see [Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md).
::: moniker-end

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)
::: moniker range="vsts"
In **New navigation**, you select services&mdash;such as **Boards**, **Repos**, and **Pipelines**&mdash;from the sidebar and pages within those services.

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

With the previous navigation enabled, you select a service&mdash;such as **Code**, **Work**, and **Build and Release**&mdash;from the horizontal bar and pages within those services.

Now that you have an understanding of how the user interface is structured, it's time to get started using it. As you can see, there are a lot of features and functionality.  

If all you need is a code repository and bug tracking solution, then start with the [Get started with Git](../../repos/git/gitquickstart.md) and [Manage bugs](../../boards/backlogs/manage-bugs.md).  

To start planning and tracking work, see [About Agile tools](../../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md?context=vsts/default).

## Connect to the web portal, user accounts and licensing  

::: moniker range="vsts"

You connect to the web portal through a supported web browser&mdash;such as the latest versions of Edge, Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Only users who have been [added to a project](../../organizations/accounts/add-organization-users.md) can connect. This is typically done by the organization owner. 

Five account users are free as are Visual Studio subscribers and stakeholders. After that, you need to [pay for more users](../../organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users.md). Find out more about licensing from [Azure DevOps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/).

Limited access is available to an unlimited number of stakeholders for free. For details, see [Work as a Stakeholder](../../organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder.md).

You connect to the web portal through a supported web browser&mdash;such as the latest versions of Edge, Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Only users who have been [added to a project](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md) can connect. This is typically done by a member of the Project Administrators group.

Limited access is available to an unlimited number of stakeholders for free. For details, see [Work as a Stakeholder](../../organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder.md). Most regular contributors must have a TFS client access license (CAL). All Visual Studio subscriptions include a TFS CAL.

## Refresh the web portal

If data doesn't appear as expected, the first thing to try is to refresh your web browser. Refreshing your client updates the local cache with changes that were made in another client or the server. To refresh the page or object you're currently viewing, refresh the page or choose the ![Refresh icon](../../_img/icons/refresh.png) **Refresh** icon if available.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/when-to-refresh-client.md)]


## Differences between the web portal and Visual Studio  

Although you can access source code, work items, and builds from both clients, some task-specific tools are only supported in the web browser or an IDE, but not in both.
