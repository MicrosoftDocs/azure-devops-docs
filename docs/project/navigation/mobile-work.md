# View and update work items via mobile browser

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Use the mobile browser to stay updated on work tracking in Azure DevOps. When you select any work item link on your mobile device, it opens a mobile-friendly version of the work item. From there, you can update the work item or access all work items assigned to you or that you're following.

> [!NOTE]  
> The mobile browser supports Azure DevOps work tracking. To sign up for free, go to [Azure DevOps Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/). The mobile browser isn't an app, but a mobile view into select features. There's nothing to download. You access the mobile browser by selecting a link from a work item you receive in your mobile email application.

## Update a work item

Within the mobile form, you can perform almost all actions available in the [web portal form](../../boards/backlogs/add-work-items.md). Here are the actions you can take in the order they appear in the mobile form:

- Add and remove tags
- View and add to the discussion by selecting a comment
- View and update any field within the form (Assign to, State, Area, Iteration, Description, and more)
- View and open a link within the Development section
- View History
- View and open a link from the Links tab
- Open and add an attachment from the Attachments tab

Actions not available in the mobile work item form:
- You can't create or add new work items
- You can't initiate a development operation
- You can't add a link

### Interact with mobile form controls  

Mobile form controls operate as follows:

- Select any field to edit it, and the form changes to a full-screen experience. Common actions include:
  - Change the state of an item: To update the work item status, select the desired state from the dropdown menu.
  - Move to a different area path: Choose a new area path to reassign the work item within the project.
  - Add an attachment: Upload files to the work item to provide more context or resources.
  - Create or remove tags: Enter the text you want in the tag field and press **Enter** to add a tag. To remove a tag, select the "x" next to the tag name.
- Select the ![save icon](../../boards/media/icons/icon-save-wi.png) save icon to save your changes. This action ensures all updates are recorded and reflected in the work item.

### Update status (change State) 
 
To update the state, select the desired state from the dropdown menu. This action changes the work item's status, helping to track its progress. After making your selection, ensure you save your changes by selecting the ![save icon](../../boards/media/icons/icon-save-wi.png) save icon.

To add a tag, enter the desired text in the tag field and press **Enter**. The tag gets added to the work item. You can add multiple tags by repeating this process. Tags help categorize and filter work items for better organization and tracking.

## View and open work items in your activity lists 

From within the mobile work item form, you can access your work items. The mobile browser allows you to view and open work items categorized as follows:
- **Assigned to me**: Lists all work items assigned to you.
- **Following**: Lists all work items that you're following.
- **My activity**: Lists all work items that you recently viewed or updated.

These lists span all team projects that you're involved in, providing a comprehensive view of your work items across projects.

1. Select the list control from the work item form you opened.

2. Select **Work items**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/mobile-work-click-work-items.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selected work items.":::

When you open the browser, it defaults to the **Assigned to me** page. From there, you can navigate to the **Following** or **My activity** pages to access other work items. For more information, see [View and add work items](../../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md).
