# Project management and navigation glossary   

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)] 
 
This glossary describes terms used when navigating in the web portal for  Azure DevOps.  See also: 
- [Agile glossary](../../boards/work-items/agile-glossary.md) 
- [Security glossary](../../organizations/security/security-glossary.md)  


## Backlogs 
An interactive list of work items that corresponds to a team's project plan or roadmap for what the team plans to deliver. The product backlog supports prioritizing work, forecasting work by sprints, and quickly linking work to portfolio backlog items. You can define your backlog items and then manage their status using the Kanban board. 

Each product backlog can be customized by a team. Learn more: [Create your backlog](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).

## Analytics views
Analytics views provide a simplified way to specify the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on the Analytics service. The Analytics service is the reporting platform for Azure DevOps Services.

## Git repository

A Git repository supports a distributed version control system for tracking changes, reviewing contributions to the code, and more. Each developer has a copy of the source repository on their dev machine. You can add multiple Git repositories to a project. Learn more: [Git Repositories](../../repos/git/index.md).  

> [!NOTE]   
> Git in Visual Studio and Azure DevOps Services is standard Git. You can use Visual Studio with third-party Git services, and you can also use third-party Git clients with Azure DevOps Services.

## Pipelines 

Pipelines are artifacts that you define to run concurrent builds or deploy concurrent releases. Two types of pipelines are supported, private and hosted. To learn more, see [CI/CD concurrent jobs](../../pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

## Repositories

A source control folder or container you configure to help you track file changes in. You can have any number of repository on your computer, each stored in their own folder. Each repository is independent, so changes saved in one repository don't affect the contents of another. Learn more: [Create a new Git repo](../../repos/git/creatingrepo.md).    

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/glossary-terms/sprints.md)] 

## Sprint backlog 
An interactive list of work items that have been assigned to the same sprint or iteration path for a team. The sprint backlog supports teams that use Scrum methodologies. Learn more: [Sprint planning](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md).
