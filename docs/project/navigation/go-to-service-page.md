# Open a service, page, or settings 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)] 

The web portal for Azure DevOps Services or Team Foundation Server (TFS) provides support for software development teams to collaborate through the planning, development, and release cycles. You can manage source code, plan and track work, define builds, run tests, and manage releases. 

::: moniker range="vsts"

This article shows you how to navigate to functional and administrative tasks available from the web portal. There are three levels of administrative tasks: team, project, and organization.  

If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md?toc=/azure/devops/project/navigation/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/project/navigationbreadcrumb/toc.json). If you don't have access to the project, [get invited to the team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).

This article shows you how to navigate to functional and administrative tasks available from the web portal. There are four levels of administrative tasks: team, project, collection, and server.  

If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md). If you don't have access to the project, [get invited to the team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).

## Open a service or functional task page

Services support getting work done&mdash;managing code, planning and tracking work, defining and managing pipelines, creating and running tests, and so on.  

::: moniker range="vsts"
> [!NOTE]  
> Only those services that are enabled will appear in the user interface. For example, if **Boards** is disabled, then **Boards** or **Work** and all pages associated with that service won't appear. To enable or disable a service, see [Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md).
::: moniker-end

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"
You open a service by choosing the service from the sidebar and then selecting from the available pages. 

For example, here we select **Boards>Backlogs**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open a service, new navigation gif](_img/go-to-app/work-backlogs-selection.gif)

Within the page you may select a specific view or artifact, such as a team backlog or choose another page.
