## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-pca-only](../../includes/prerequisites-pca-only.md)]

## Open a service or functional task page

Services support getting work done&mdash;managing code, planning and tracking work, defining and managing pipelines, creating and running tests, and so on.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Only those services that are enabled appear in the user interface. For example, if **Boards** is disabled, then **Boards** or **Work** and all pages associated with that service don't appear. To enable or disable a service, see [Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md).

You open a service by choosing the service from the sidebar and then selecting from the available pages. 

For example, here we select **Boards** > **Backlogs**.

Within the page you might select a specific view or artifact, such as a team backlog or choose another page.
