# Open a service, page, or settings 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)] 

From a supported web browser&mdash;such as the latest versions of Edge, Chrome, Safari, or Firefox&mdash;you access the services supported by Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or Team Foundation Server (TFS). The web portal provides support for teams to collaborate through the planning, development, and release cycles. You use the web portal to perform both software development and administrative tasks.  

You can manage source code, plan and track work, define builds, run tests, and manage releases. 

::: moniker range="vsts"
If you don't have a project yet, create one in [VSTS](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md?toc=/vsts/project/navigation/toc.json&bc=/vsts/project/navigationbreadcrumb/toc.json). If you don't have access to the project, [get invited to the team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).

If you don't have a project yet, create one in your [on-premises TFS](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md). If you don't have access to the project, [get invited to the team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).

## Open a service or page

Services support getting work done&mdash;managing code, planning and tracking work, defining and managing pipelines, creating and running tests, and so on. 
# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range="vsts"
You open a service by choosing the service from the sidebar and then selecting from the available pages. 

For example, here we select **Work>Backlogs**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

Within the page you may select a specific view or artifact, such as a team backlog or choose another page.
