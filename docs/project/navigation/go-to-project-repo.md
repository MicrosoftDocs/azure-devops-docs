# Switch project, repository, team 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

Several features depend on the project, repository, or team that you have selected. For example, dashboards, backlogs, and board views will change depending on the project and team you select.

Also, when you add a work item, the system references the default area and iteration paths defined for the team context. Work items you add from the team dashboard (new work item widget) and queries page are assigned the team default iteration. Work items you add from a team backlog or board, are assigned the team default backlog iteration. For more information, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).  

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects** preview feature is enabled for the organization, users added to the **Project-Scoped Users** group won't be able to access projects that they haven't been added to. For more information including important security-related call-outs, see [Manage your organization, Limit  user visibility for projects and more](../../user-guide/manage-organization-collection.md#project-scoped-user-group).
