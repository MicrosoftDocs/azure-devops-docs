# Give feedback using Microsoft Feedback Client

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]


You can respond to a request for feedback using the Microsoft Feedback Client. This tool allows you to launch an application, capture your interaction with it as video and capture your verbal or type-written comments as well. To support traceability, your feedback is stored in the data store for Azure DevOps Services or an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS).  

The Microsoft Feedback Client is installed automatically with the latest versions of Visual Studio, or you can download for free from the following page on the Microsoft website: [Microsoft Feedback Client Download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48142). 

## Initiate a feedback session

When you receive an email request for feedback, it contains a link to launch Microsoft Feedback Client, and a link to install the feedback tool if it is not already installed. 

### To install Microsoft Feedback Client

You can skip this procedure if you already have Microsoft Feedback Client installed or if you will access the feedback tool on a remote machine.  

1. Open your email request, and then choose the Install the feedback tool link to install Microsoft Feedback Client.
