# About feedback

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]


Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server (TFS) provide two main methods for collecting feedback on your work apps. You can use of these two clients to collect feedback: 

- Test & Feedback extension, a web-based client
- Microsoft Feedback client, a free download users install on their local computer. 

To request feedback, you use these methods: 
- From within the work item form for a user story or product backlog item, as shown in the following image:<br/>![Request feedback from the Test & Feedback extension](/azure/devops/test/_img/request-stakeholder-feedback/request-stakeholder-feedback-01.png) 
- From the dashboard widget that contains other links, as shown:<br/>![Request feedback from the dashboard](/azure/devops/project/feedback/_img/request-feedback-link.png)

Both tools generate a Feedback Request work item. Each response provided by a stakeholder generates a Feedback Response work item. You can then track requests and responses easily from the **Work>Queries** page.
