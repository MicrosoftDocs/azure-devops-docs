# Change the audio device or annotation tool

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You can change the default settings used by Microsoft Feedback Client for the annotation tool or audio device. The annotation tool that you set automatically opens when you double-click an image within the feedback tool, and the audio device is used when you start a **Screen & Voice** or a **Voice only** recording.  You might want to make a change if you do not have the default tools available on the computer that you use to provide feedback.  
  
 To change a setting, first launch Microsoft Feedback Client. For more information, see [Provide feedback](give-feedback.md).  
  
### To change the annotation tool or annotation settings  
  
1.  On the toolbar at the top of Microsoft Feedback Client, choose the **Change settings** button.  
  
2.  In the **Change settings** dialog box, choose the **Browse** button.  
  
3.  In the **Open** dialog box, navigate to the annotation tool and executable file that you want, and then choose the **Open** button.  
  
4.  (Optional) Enter any arguments that can be passed to the annotation tool.  
  
     For example, **%f** represents the file name to pass to the tool.  
  
5.  (Optional) Select the **After taking screenshot, immediately open in the specified annotation tool** check box to enable the annotation tool to open automatic.  
  
6.  Choose the **Save** button.
