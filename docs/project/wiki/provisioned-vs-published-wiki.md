# Provisioned wikis vs. published code as a wiki

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2018.md)]

<!--- Supports https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866310 -->

With publish code as wiki, you have the following options for maintaining wiki content.

- [Provision a wiki for your team project](wiki-create-repo.md). This option supports only one wiki for the team project.
- [Publish Markdown files defined in a Git repository to a wiki](publish-repo-to-wiki.md). With this option, you can maintain several versioned wikis to support your content needs, although it's available only if Azure Repos is enabled.

While both options maintain the wiki content in Git repositories, the way you add, update, and manage the wiki content differs.

> [!NOTE]  
> The publish code as wiki feature is currently available on Azure DevOps Services . For TFS 2018 and later versions, you can only [provision a wiki for your team project](wiki-create-repo.md).  

## Wiki page menu options

With a *provisioned wiki*, you add and edit pages directly within the **Wiki**. All content updates to a *provisioned wiki* occur within the **Wiki**.

With a publish code as wiki, you add, edit, and update content from **Repos** or **Code**.

The unavailable menu options for the wiki pages are shown in the following illustration. As you can see, several options aren't supported for the* publish as code wiki* pages.

> |------|---------|
> | ![Provisioned wiki page menu options](_img/wiki/diff-menu-options-provisioned.png) | ![Publish code page menu options](_img/wiki/diff-menu-options.png) |

For example, the **Edit** option for the publish code as wiki takes you to the **Code** page to edit that specific page. Updates you make to a page in the branch you selected for the wiki are automatically published to the wiki.  

## Supported features and operational differences

*Provisioned wikis* and *publish as code wikis* support the following features:

- [Markdown format](markdown-guidance.md)
- [HTML tags](markdown-guidance.md#html)
- [Insert and resize images](markdown-guidance.md#images)
- [Mathematical notation and characters](markdown-guidance.md#mathematical-notation)
- [Link to work items using #](markdown-guidance.md#link-work-items)
- [Attach files](markdown-guidance.md#attach)
- [Filter Wiki contents](filter-print-wiki.md)
- [Wiki search](search-wiki.md)  
- [Print a Wiki page](filter-print-wiki.md)

The following table summarizes those operations or features that may differ, depending on the wiki type.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]

## Add pages

For a *provisioned wiki*, select **New page** or **Add subpage**. To learn more, see [Add and edit wiki pages](add-edit-wiki.md#add-page).

For a *publish code as wiki*, add a Markdown file under the folder of the branch that you published. The file must end in **.md** for the wiki to recognize it as a page to publish. To learn more, see [Publish a Git repository to a wiki](add-edit-wiki.md#add-page).

<a id="toc"></a>

## Page sequence and the table of contents (TOC)

The *provisioned wiki* manages the page sequence and table of contents automatically as you add or move pages within the TOC.

To structure the TOC for a *publish code as wiki*, define the **.order** file at the root, and for each subfolder or parent page that contains subpages.

Both types of wikis follow the same file structure, it's just that the publish code as wiki requires you to maintain the page sequence manually.

To learn more about working with **.order** files, see  [Wiki Git repository files and file structure](wiki-file-structure.md#order-file).

## Page revisions and reverting to a previous version

From the **Wiki**, you can view the revisions of any wiki page by choosing **Revisions** or selecting the **View revisions** menu option.

However, the revert process differs depending on the wiki page type.  

- For a *provisioned wiki* page, select **Revert**, as described in [Revert a commit to a provisioned wiki page](wiki-view-history.md#revert-provision)
- For a *publish as code wiki* page, work from a local branch and submit a pull request to update the branch you're working from. For more details, see [Revert a commit to a provisioned wiki page](wiki-view-history.md#revert-publish).

<a id="versioning"></a>

## Versioning and unpublishing a wiki

Versioning allows you to publish different content versions to distinct wikis, based on a versioned branch of a Git repo. Versioning and the ability to unpublish content that you've previously published to a wiki, are only supported for wikis that you've created by publishing code to a wiki.

To learn more, see [Version, select, or unpublish a published wiki](wiki-select-unpublish-versions.md).

## Update a wiki by working offline

You can work offline or in a local branch to update content for a  *provisioned wiki* and *publish as code wiki*. To learn more, see [Clone and update wiki pages offline](wiki-update-offline.md).
