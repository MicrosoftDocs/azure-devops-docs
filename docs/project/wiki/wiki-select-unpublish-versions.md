# Publish, unpublish, and select version of a wiki

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-azure-devops.md)]

When you publish a Git repository to a wiki, you can publish new branch of the repo as versions, select a version to view, or unpublish the repo.

## Publish a new wiki branch

If your published wiki corresponds to a product version, you can publish new branches as you release new versions of your product. To create a new version, create a new branch of your repo, and then make updates to that new branch.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

1. To create a new branch from the web portal, open **Repos > Branches**, open the ![ ](../../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon for the branch you have previously published, and select **New branch**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create a new branch](_img/wiki/publish-wiki-create-branch-vert.png)

1. To publish the new branch to a wiki, open the **Wiki** page for the currently published branch, open the branch picker, and then choose **Publish new branch**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Publish new version menu option](_img/wiki/publish-new-version-option.png)

1. Complete the form, choosing the branch that you previously created.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Publish new version dialog box](_img/wiki/publish-new-version.png)

1. Select **Update**.

## Select a wiki version

To select a wiki version, choose the version from the branch options from the **Wiki** page.

## Unpublish a published wiki

If you no longer want a repository to be published as a wiki, you can choose to unpublish it from **Wiki**. Unpublishing a wiki unpublishes all versions of the repository that you have published previously.

1. Select the wiki you want to unpublish, open the context menu, and select **Unpublish wiki**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Unpublish a wiki confirm dialog](_img/wiki/unpublish-wiki-code-option.png)

2. Confirm that you want to unpublish the wiki by choosing **Unpublish**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Select wiki version](_img/wiki/unpublish-wiki.png)
