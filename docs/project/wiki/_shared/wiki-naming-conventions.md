### Special characters in Wiki page titles

You can specify page titles which contain one or more of these special characters `: < > * ? | -`. For example, you can name a Markdown file as "FAQ?" or "Set-up guide". The following characters are translated to their URI encoded strings:

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |        Character        | Encoded string |
> |------|---------|
> |         :       |      %3A       |
> |         <       |      %3C       |
> |        >        |      %3E       |
> |        *        |      %2A       |
> |        ?        |      %3F       |
> |        \|       |      %7C       |
> |        -        |      %2D       |
> |         "       |      %22       |
