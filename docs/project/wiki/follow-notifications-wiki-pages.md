# Follow a wiki page, get notifications

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Follow a Wiki page to receive email notifications whenever the page is edited, deleted, or renamed.

You receive immediate notifications for renames and deletions. For edits, you receive a 30-minute digest email that includes all edits made within that period. This digest helps prevent your inbox from being spammed with individual edit notifications.

## Follow a wiki page

To follow a Wiki page, select the **Follow** button on the page you want to track. You can manage your notification settings in your user profile to ensure you receive updates as needed.

When you create a page, you become a default follower of the page. 

## Unfollow a wiki page

You can unfollow a wiki page in the following ways:

- **UI:** Select the **Unfollow** button on the page.
