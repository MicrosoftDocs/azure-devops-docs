# Follow a wiki page, get notifications

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Follow a Wiki page and get notified by email whenever the page is edited, deleted, or renamed.

Get immediate notifications for rename and delete. For edit notifications, you get a 30-minute digest email with all edits that occurred within that period. This digest prevents the emails from spamming your inbox.

When you create a page, you become a default follower of the page. You can unfollow the page in the following two ways:

* From within the UI

   ![Select the unfollow button](_img/wiki/unfollow-button.png)

* From within the footer of your email notification

To reduce noise, you donâ€™t get notified for pages that you follow when the action is performed by you.

> [!NOTE]
> When a page is deleted, all followers are removed.
