## Manage wiki permissions

By default, all project contributors have read and edit access of the wiki repository. You can grant or restrict access to who can read and edit wiki pages by managing the wiki repository permissions.

## Don't have access to create a page?

If you don't have access to create a wiki page, you need to contact an administrator to grant you adequate permission on the underlying Git repository of the wiki.

## Stakeholder wiki access

Users with [Stakeholder access](../../organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder.md) in a private project can read wiki pages and view revisions, however they can't perform any edit operations. For example, stakeholders can't create, edit, reorder, or revert changes to pages. These permissions can't be changed. They have full access to Wikis in public projects.

## Q & A

### Q: Is it possible to grant permissions on a per-page basis?

**A:** No, permissions to access the wiki are made for all pages and not individual pages.
