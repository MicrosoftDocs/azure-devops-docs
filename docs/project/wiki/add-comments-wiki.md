# Add comments to wiki pages

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Learn how to add comments to wiki pages for better collaboration.

## Add a comment

Add a comment at the bottom of any wiki page. Comments are posted on a per-branch basis. For example, if you make a comment on a wiki page on the main branch, it doesn't appear in another published branch of a file of the same name. Comments are stored on the internal database. For more information, see [Data locations for Azure DevOps](../../organizations/security/data-location.md).

### View Markdown and preview tabs

When you add a Markdown-based comment, there's a Markdown editor and preview tab. Use these tabs to view and change how the comment is rendered before you add it. You can also @mention users and groups. This @mention sends an email notification to each user or group, with a link to the wiki page.
