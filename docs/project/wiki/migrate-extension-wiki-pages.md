# Migrate pages from Wiki extension to a team project wiki

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2018](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2018.md)]

This article helps you migrate pages made using the [Wiki Marketplace  extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.wiki) to your team project Wiki. With the release of the built-in wiki, any wiki pages created using the Wiki Marketplace extension have been saved to a Git repo in your team project. 

The **Wiki** feature is available for TFS 2018 and later versions. To learn more, see [Create a wiki for your team project](wiki-create-repo.md).  

## Prerequisites

You must be a member of the Contributors group of your team project to migrate wiki pages to your team project Wiki.  

## Migrate pages and other artifacts

1. Clone [vsts-wikiTools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-wikiTools) repository and compile the **MigrateToVSTSWiki** tool
2. Create, and then clone your Azure DevOps wiki
3. Move and commit all Markdown pages to your Azure DevOps wiki
4. Run the wiki migration tool, **MigrateToVSTSWiki.exe**
5. When the wiki migration tool is complete, push the changes to the default master branch, *wikiMaster*, of the Azure DevOps wiki repository.

## Detailed steps

1. Clone [vsts-wikiTools](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-wikiTools) repository and compile the **MigrateToVSTSWiki** tool

2. Compile the project under the path **Tools/MigrateToVSTSWiki** to generate the migration tool EXE.
  
3. From a web browser, open your Azure DevOps team project and [create your first wiki page](wiki-create-repo.md).

4. Get the URL to clone your wiki. See [Clone your wiki and edit wiki pages offline](wiki-update-offline.md).  

   Name this clone location "LocationA" for this procedure.

5. Clone your Wiki repo using your IDE or **git clone** command.

6. Clone the Wiki extension repo. The Wiki is mapped to a folder given to you during the wiki creation. You can confirm by going to the "manage wiki" option in the existing wiki, as shown below.

   Your existing wiki pages are saved under the folder labelled "Root".

   For example, you cloned the previously mentioned "sampleWiki" in the location "C:\wiki\sampleWiki". The wiki pages are saved in the path "C:\wiki\sampleWiki\ _extensionWiki"

   Name this location "LocationB" for this procedure.

7. Create an empty folder in any path on your local machine, and name it "LocationC" for this procedure.  

   **In summary, the following locations are represented as follows:**
   - Location A = Azure DevOps Wiki repo
   - Location B = Wiki extension repo
   - Location C = Empty folder to run migration tool in

8. Open a command prompt as an administrator and run **MigrateToVSTSWiki.exe**.  This tool copies the files from your existing wiki to the destination directory you provide. During copying, the tool converts the pages to be compliant with the Azure DevOps wiki.

	`MigrateToVSTSWiki.exe /source:LocationB /destination:LocationC`

	For example:
	- "E:\wiki\sampleWiki\_extensionWiki" is the folder in which the existing wiki files are present
	- "E:\Temp\Wiki\New" is the empty folder into which the migrated files are to be copied.

9. Remove all files from "LocationA" (if any) apart from the git related files such as .gitignore etc.

11. Copy all files from "LocationC" and paste them into "LocationA".

11. Run **git add .** to stage all the newly added files in  "LocationA" for the commit.
  
12. Run **git commit -m <commit message>** to commit the files that you have staged locally.

13. Run **git push origin wikiMaster -f** . to push the changes to the default branch of the Azure DevOps Wiki.

>[!NOTE]  
>Once you have migrated your Wiki extension files to the Azure DevOps Wiki, you're ready to uninstall the Wiki extension.
