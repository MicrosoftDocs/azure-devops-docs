# Default permissions and access set for collaboration tools

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Collaboration tools encompass READMEs, team project wikis, notifications, feedback, and search.  

Most of these tools are available to you if you're added as a team member or a member of the Contributors group for a team project. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. For a simplified view of all default permissions assigned to built-in groups, see [Default permissions and access](../../organizations/security/permissions-access.md).  

Stakeholders have limited access to view the charts and dashboards. To learn more, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../organizations/security/includes/wiki.md)]

## Manage permissions

To manage permissions for a wiki, see [Manage README & Wiki permissions (security)](manage-readme-wiki-permissions.md?toc=/azure/devops/project/wiki/toc.json)

To manage notifications, see the following articles:

- [Manage personal notifications](../../organizations/notifications/manage-your-personal-notifications.md)
- [Manage team notifications](../../organizations/notifications/manage-team-group-global-organization-notifications.md)

> [!NOTE]
> There are no UI permissions associated with managing notifications. Instead, you can manage them using the [TFSSecurity command line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#collection-level-permissions).
