# Quickstart: Share your project mission, view project activity

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)]

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

From the project summary page, share your projectwith your team, add project members, and check the latest project activity. Share your projectand objective, and ways for team members to contribute to the project through a project README file or through a project wiki.  

If you want to use a project wiki, then you'll want to first [Create a Wiki for your project](wiki-create-repo.md). You can then [change the project summary page to point to the wiki](#change-repo).

::: moniker-end

## Prerequisites

- You must be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or have your **Edit project-level information** permission set to **Allow** to do the following:
  - Edit information on the project page
  - Change the repository that you use to share your project mission
  - Manage project membership
- To edit a page, you must be a contributor to the repository or branch or have the **Contribute** permissions set to **Allow**.  
- To view the project page, you must be a valid member of the project. For more information, see [Permissions and groups, Valid user groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md#validusers).

## Open Project summary

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation-azd.md)]  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)  

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"
  
From your web browser, choose **Overview>Summary**. If you don't have a  project yet, [create a project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).

If you haven't set up your project summary yet, you'll see this welcome page:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open project summary, new nav](_img/share-project/welcome-page-new-nav.png)  

Select one of the following tasks to get started:

- **Invite** to begin [adding others to your project](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). Note, you can only invite users who have already been [added to your organization](../../organizations/accounts/add-team-members.md).
- **Boards** to begin [adding work items](../../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md).
- **Repos** to open [Repos>Files](../../repos/git/clone.md) page where you can clone or import a repository, or [initialize a README file](#initialize-readme) for your project summary page.
- **Pipelines** to start [defining a pipeline](../../pipelines/index.md).
- **Test Plans** to start [defining test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).
- [Manage your services](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md) to disable the visibility of one or more services.

To support your project mission, choose a README file that you maintain in a project repository, or the [project Wiki](wiki-create-repo.md). To choose between a README file or a Wiki, see [Change the repository](#change-repo). To define a README file for your project, see [Initialize a README file for your Git repo](#initialize-git) or [Initialize a README file for your TFVC repo](#initialize-tfvc).

## Initialize a README file for a Git repo

You can share your projectand objective, as well as ways for team members to contribute to the project through a project README file. For Git projects, the README.md file needs to be at the root of each repository in the default branch. For Git based projects the left pane supports navigation to other repositories. A separate Welcome page/README.md file can be created for each repository.  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

1. Open **Repos>Files**. This page guides you to get started quickly by adding code to your repository when you choose one of the options to clone, push, import, or initialize a repo.  

2. With the **Add a README** check box checked, choose **Initialize**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Initialize README file, new nav](_img/share-project/initialize-readme-new-nav.png)

   A default README file is added to the project repository, in this case, the **Fabrikam Test** repo.

3. Return to **Overview>Summary** and choose the README file for the project page. Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/edit.png) edit icon.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Choose README file, new nav](_img/share-project/choose-readme-file-new-nav.png)  

4. Select the project repository where you initialized the README file.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Choose Repository where the README file exists, new nav](_img/share-project/choose-readme-file-dialog-new-nav.png)  

5. To edit the README file, choose the README file link.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Edit the README file, new nav](_img/share-project/edit-readme-file.png)  

   You're directed to the **Repos>Files** page for the README file. You can edit and modify the READMEMarkdown file like you would any other file in a Git repository. You can use Markdown language to format the README file and add images. To learn more about adding a README file, see [Create a README for your repo](../../repos/git/create-a-readme.md) and [Markdown guidance](../wiki/markdown-guidance.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"
[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation-not-supported.md)]  
::: moniker-end

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

::: moniker range="tfs-2018 || vsts"

1. Open the Project home page.

2. With the **Add a README** check box checked, choose **Initialize**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Initialize README file, new nav](_img/share-project/initialize-readme-prev-nav.png)

   A default README file is added to the project repository, in this case, the **Fabrikam Test** repo.

3. To edit the project README.md file, choose **Edit**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Git new project summary page](_img/share-project/git-start-page-readme.png)

   Use Markdown language to format the README file and add images. To learn more about adding a README file, see [Create a README for your repo](../../repos/git/create-a-readme.md) and [Markdown guidance](../wiki/markdown-guidance.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015  <= tfs-2017"  

1. You can start editing directly from the Welcome page.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Project page, Edit Welcome Markdown page](_img/share-project/markdown-welcome-page-edit.png)  

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you set policies on the Git repository, changes to the welcome page must be done as a pull request.  

2. To add another page, enter a link to a new Markdown file that doesn't yet exist, for example:

   `[page-1](./page-1.md)`

3. After you save the file, select the link. Respond to the prompt to edit the file and commit it to your repository.

## Initialize a README file for a TFVC repo

For projects that selected TFVC for version control, the README.md file needs to be at the root of your team project folder (i.e. $/TeamProject/README.md).

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

1. Open **Repos>Files**.

2. Select **Add Project Description**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

3. Select the TFVC repository and choose **Save**. If no README file has been created yet in the repo, you'll see the following message.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![About this project dialog, new nav](_img/share-project/about-this-project-form.png)

4. To create a README file, choose **Repos>Files** and choose new file to add a file to the project repository.

5. Name the file as **README.md**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Add new file dialog, new nav](_img/share-project/create-readme-file-web-portal.png)

6. Add the contents of your README file inMarkdown format, and then choose **Check in...**.
