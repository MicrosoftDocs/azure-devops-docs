summary: | 
  **Azure DevOps Services**  

  See the following frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers for access and permissions in Azure DevOps. For troubleshooting information, see [Troubleshoot access and permission issues](troubleshoot-permissions.md).

sections:
  - name: General
    questions: 
      - question: Why can't users access some features?
        answer: |
           They may need a different [access level](access-levels.md#supported-access-levels) assigned. This is in addition to permissions granted through security groups. For example, [Stakeholder](access-levels.md#stakeholder-access) access level provides partial support to select features, allowing users to view and modify work items, but not to use all features.

      - question: How do I find my administrator? 
        answer: |
          See [Find your administrator](lookup-organization-owner-admin.md).

      - question: I accidentally removed my permissions and am unable to grant them again. What should I do?
        answer: |
          The only way to resolve this scenario is to [find your project/org administrator](lookup-organization-owner-admin.md) and ask them to grant the permission again.

  - name: Users and guest users
    questions: 
      - question: How do I remove users from Azure DevOps? 
        answer: |
          See [How to remove users from Azure DevOps](../accounts/delete-organization-users.md).
      
      - question: I added a user to my project. Why can't they see the project?  
        answer: |
          To view a [project](permissions.md#project-level-groups), users must have the [**view project level information permission** set to **allow**](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md#set-permissions-at-the-project--or-collection-level).  
      - question: Why can't guest users search for Azure Active Directory users?
        answer: |
          By default, [Azure AD guests can't search the Azure AD in the manner required by Azure DevOps](../accounts/faq-azure-access.yml#q--why-are--no-identities-found--when-i-try-to-add-users-from-azure-ad-to-my-azure-devops-organization-).

  - name: Organizations
    questions:
      - question: Why can't I create an organization? 
        answer: |
          Contact your administrator to determine if your organization is using [the Azure AD tenant policy to restrict new organization creation](../accounts/azure-ad-tenant-policy-restrict-org-creation.md).
