sections:
  - name: General
    questions: 
      - question: Why can't users access some features?
        answer: |
           They may need a different [access level](access-levels.md#supported-access-levels) assigned. This is in addition to permissions granted through security groups. For example, [Stakeholder access](stakeholder-access.md) access level provides partial support to select features, allowing users to view and modify work items, but not to use all features.

      - question: How do I find my administrator? 
        answer: |
          See one of the following articles: [Look up a project administrator](look-up-project-administrators.md), [Look up a project collection administrator](look-up-project-collection-administrators.md), or [Look up the organization owner](look-up-organization-owner.md).

      - question: I accidentally removed my permissions and am unable to grant them again. What should I do?
        answer: |
          The only way to resolve this scenario is to [Request an increase in permission levels](request-changes-permissions.md).

  - name: Users and guest users
    questions: 
      - question: How do I remove users from Azure DevOps? 
        answer: |
          See [How to remove users from Azure DevOps](../accounts/delete-organization-users.md).
      
      - question: I added a user to my project. Why can't they see the project?  
        answer: |
          Verify that the user hasn't been added to a group where the project-level **View project-level information** permission is not set or is set to **Deny**. To learn more, see [Change project-level permissions](change-project-level-permissions.md).  

      - question: Why can't guest users search for Azure Active Directory users?
        answer: |
          By default, [Access via Azure AD FAQs. Azure AD guests can't search the Azure AD in the manner required by Azure DevOps](../accounts/faq-azure-access.yml#no-identities).

  - name: Organizations
    questions:
      - question: Why can't I create an organization? 
        answer: |
          Contact your administrator to determine if your organization is using [the Azure AD tenant policy to restrict new organization creation](../accounts/azure-ad-tenant-policy-restrict-org-creation.md).
