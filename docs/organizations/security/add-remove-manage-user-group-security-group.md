# Use security groups to manage users and groups

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

To manage permissions and access, use security groups. You can use default or custom groups to set permissions. You can add users and groups to multiple groups. For instance, you add most developers to the **Contributors** group. When they join a team, they also join the teamâ€™s group.

For more information, see the following articles: 

  - [Add Active Directory / Microsoft Entra users or groups to a built-in security group](add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md)
  - [Add users & manage access](../accounts/add-organization-users.md)  
  - [Add users or groups to a team or project](add-users-team-project.md)  
  - [Remove user accounts](/azure/active-directory/add-users-azure-active-directory#delete-a-user) 
  - [Manage access using permissions](restrict-access.md)
  - [Change project-level permissions](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md)
  - [Change project collection-level permissions](../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md)

Users inherit permissions from the group(s) that they belong to. If a permission is set to **Allow** for one group and **Deny** for another group to which the user belongs, then their effective permission assignment is **Deny**. For more information, see [About permissions/Inheritance](about-permissions.md#security-groups-and-membership).  

## How Azure DevOps uses security groups 

Azure DevOps uses security groups for the following purposes: 

- Determine permissions allocated to a group or user 
- Determine access level allocated to a group or user
- Filter work item queries based on membership within a group 
- Use **@mention** of a project-level group to send email notifications to members of that group
- Send team notifications to members of a team group 
- Add a group to a role-based permission
- Set object-level permissions to a security group 

[!INCLUDE [version-all](./includes/hidden-security-groups.md)]
 
## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
|**Permissions**| - To manage permissions or groups at the project level: Member of the **Project Administrators** security group.<br>- To manage permissions or groups at the collection level: Member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.  |

> [!NOTE]  
> Users added to the **Project-Scoped Users** group can't access most **Organization settings** pages, including permissions. For more information, see [Manage your organization, Limit  user visibility for projects and more](../../user-guide/manage-organization-collection.md#project-scoped-user-group).

## Create a custom security group 

Create a project-level group when you want to manage permissions at the project- or object-level for a project. Create a collection-level group when you want to manage permissions at the collection level. For more information, see [Change project-level permissions](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md) and [Change project collection-level permissions](../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page)

### Create a project-level group 

1. Open the web portal and select the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Select **Project settings** > **Permissions**. 

	![Screenshot, open Project settings, Permissions.](media/permissions/project-settings-permissions.png)

3. Select **New Group** to open the dialog for adding a group. 

### Create a project collection-level group

1. Open the web portal and select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/project-icon.png" border="false"::: Azure DevOps icon, and then select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/gear-icon.png" border="false"::: **Organization settings**. 

    ![Screenshot of opening Organization settings.](../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert-2.png)  

2. Under **Security**, select **Permissions**, and then choose **New group** to open the dialog for adding a group. 

   ![Screenshot showing creating a security group at the organization-level.](media/project-collection/organization-permissions-add-group.png)  


### Define the new group  

1. In the dialog that opens, enter a **Name** for the group. Optionally, add members and a description for the group. 
 
    For example, here we define a Work Tracking Administrators group.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/project-collection/create-new-group-at-org-level.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the security group dialog, Add a security group at the organization-level.":::

2. Choose **Create** when you're done.

	[![Screenshot of Project Settings, Security page.](media/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](media/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox) 

3. Under **Groups**, choose one of the following options:
   - **Readers**: To add users who require read-only access to the project, choose.
   - **Contributors**: To add users who contribute fully to this project or who have been granted Stakeholder access.
   - **Project Administrators**: To add users who need to administrate the project. For more information, see [Change project-level permissions](change-project-level-permissions.md).

4. Select the **Members** tab.

   Here we choose the **Contributors** group.

	![Screenshot showing the security page, Contributors group, Membership page.](media/add-users/add-members-to-contributors-group.png)  

   The default team group, and any other teams you add to the project, get included as members of the **Contributors** group. Add a new user as a member of a team instead, and the user automatically inherits Contributor permissions. 

    > [!TIP]
    > Managing users is much easier [using groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md), not individual users.

5. Choose :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/add-light-icon.png" border="false"::: **Add** to add a user or a user group.

6. Enter the name of the user account into the text box. You can enter several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system automatically searches for matches. choose the match(es) that meets your requirements.

	![Screenshot showing Add users and group dialog, server version.](media/project-level-permissions-add-a-user.png)  

   The first time you add a user or group to Azure DevOps, you can't browse to it or check the friendly name. After the identity gets added, you can just enter the friendly name.

7. Choose **Save changes** when you're done. 

8. (Optional) You can customize a user's permission for other functionality in the project. For example, in [areas and iterations](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or [shared queries](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Users with limited access, such as Stakeholders, can't access select features even if granted permissions to those features. For more information, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

## Add users or groups to a security group

As roles and responsibilities change, you might need to change the permission levels for individual members of a project. The easiest way to do that is to add the user or a group of users to either a default or custom security group.  If roles change, you can then remove the user from a group.

Here we show how to add a user to the built-in **Project Administrators** group. The method is similar no matter what group you're adding. If your organization is connected to Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory, then you can add security groups defined in those directories to Azure DevOps security groups. For more information, see [Add Active Directory / Microsoft Entra users or groups to a built-in security group](add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md). If you need to add more than 10k users or groups to an Azure DevOps security group, we recommend adding an Azure Directory / Microsoft Entra group containing the users, instead of adding the users directly.

## On-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, see these other articles: 

- [Add a user as an Azure DevOps Server administrator](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator) 
- [Azure DevOps Server service account groups](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies)
