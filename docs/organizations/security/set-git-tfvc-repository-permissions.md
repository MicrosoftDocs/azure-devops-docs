# Set repository permissions for Git or TFVC

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

By default, members of the project Contributors group have permissions to contribute to a repository. However, to create and manage permissions for a repository, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group.  You can grant or restrict access to a repository by setting the permission state to **Allow** or **Deny** for a single user or a security group. 

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project. If you don't have a project yet, create one in [Azure DevOps](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md) or set one up in an [on-premises TFS](../projects/create-project.md).
* You must be a member of the [Project Administrators Group](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or have your **Manage permissions** set to **Allow** for Git repositories or the TFVC repository.  

## Default repository permissions  

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

To contribute to the source code, you must be granted **Basic** access level or greater. Users granted **Stakeholder** access for private projects have no access to source code. Users granted **Stakeholder** access for public projects have the same access as Contributors and those granted **Basic** access. To learn more, see [About access levels](access-levels.md).

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

To contribute to the source code, you must be granted **Basic** access level or greater. Users granted **Stakeholder** access have no access to source code. To learn more, see [About access levels](access-levels.md).

For a description of each security group and permission level, see [Permissions and group reference](permissions.md).  

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"

### Git

You can use Git repositories to host and collaborate on your source code. For an overview of code features and functions, see [Git](../../repos/git/overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/code-git.md)]

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"

### TFVC 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015"

[Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)](../../repos/tfvc/overview.md) provides a centralized version control system to manage your source control.

## Set Git repository permissions

You can set the permissions for all Git repositories for a project, or for a single repository. 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. To set the permissions for all Git repositories for a project, choose **Git Repositories** and then choose the security group whose permissions you want to manage. 

	For example, here we choose (1) **Project Settings**, (2) **Repositories**, (3) **Git repositories**, (4) the **Contributors** group, and then (5) the permission for **Create repository**.

	Otherwise, choose a specific repository and choose the security group whose permissions you want to manage.   

	> [!NOTE]  
	> If you add a user or group, and don't change any permissions for that user or group, then upon refresh of the permissions page, the user or group you added no longer appears.
 
4. When done, choose **Save changes**.

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).  

1. Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/gear-icon.png) gear icon to open the administrative context.

	> ![Open Project Settings, horizontal nav](../../_shared/_img/settings/open-project-settings-horz.png)  
	
2. Choose **Version Control**.

3. To set the set the permissions for all Git repositories for a project, (1) choose **Git Repositories** and then (2) choose the security group whose permissions you want to manage. 

	Otherwise, choose a specific repository and choose the security group whose permissions you want to manage.   

4. Choose the setting for the permission you want to change. 

	Here we grant permissions to the Contributors group to (3) create repositories.

## Set TFVC repository permissions


::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. To set the set the permissions for the TFVC repository for a project, choose **TFVC Repository** and then choose the security group whose permissions you want to manage.

	For example, here we choose (1) **Project Settings**, (2) **Repositories**, (3) the **TFVC repository**, (4) the **Contributors** group, and then (5) the permission for **Manage branch**.

	*To see the full image, click to expand*.

	[![Project Settings>Code>Repositories>TFVC repositories>Security](_img/git-tfvc-perm/open-tfvc-repository-security-vert-reduced.png)](_img/git-tfvc-perm/open-tfvc-repository-security-vert.png#lightbox) 

	> [!NOTE]  
	> If you add a user or group, and don't change any permissions for that user or group, then upon refresh of the permissions page, the user or group you added no longer appears.

1. Save your changes.  

::: moniker-end    


::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

1. From the web portal, open the admin context by choosing the ![ ](../../boards/_img/icons/gear_icon.png) gear Settings icon and choose **Version Control**.

1. Choose the TFVC repository for the project and then choose the security group whose permissions you want to manage.   

2. Change the permission setting to **Allow** or **Deny**. 

	For example, here we change the **Manage branch** permission to Allow for all members of the Contributors group.
