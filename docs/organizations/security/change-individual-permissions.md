# Tutorial: Change individual or group permissions, grant select access to specific functions

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

The standard way for permissions to accrue to individuals are by adding user accounts to one or more built-in security groups. However, in certain instances, you'll want to grant additional permissions to select individuals, but perhaps not all permissions assigned to the security group. For example, you might want to grant several individuals the ability to add or edit area and iteration paths, but not have all permissions available to members of the Project Administrators group.

The three ways to change permissions for an individual are:

- Create a custom Azure DevOps security group, define permissions for that group, add the user account to the group
- For object-level permissions: Add the user account and set permissions
- For project or collection-level permissions: Search for the user account and selectively change their permission assignments

In this article you learn how to do the following:

> * Create a custom security group 
> * Set permissions for a custom security group 
> * Add members to a custom security group 
> * Change the permission assignments for an individual user account  

If you are new to administrating permissions and groups, review [About permissions and groups](about-permissions.md) to learn about permission states and inheritance.

## Create a custom security group

Create a custom security group at the project-level or the collection-level. The method for creating a custom security group is the same, no matter at what level you add it. 

To create a project-level security group, open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)] 


# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

1. Choose **Project Settings** > **Security**.

	*To see the full image, click to expand*.

	[ ![Project Settings>Security](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox)  

2. Choose **Create group** to open the dialog for adding a group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Create a custom security group](_img/change-individual-permissions/create-group-open-dialog.png)" 

3. Enter a name for the group, and optionally a description.

    For example, here we define a Team Admins group.

    ![Security group dialog, Add a security group at the project level](_img/change-individual-permissions/create-project-level-group-dialog.png)

4. Choose **Create group**.

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation-not-supported.md)]  
::: moniker-end  


# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018 || vsts"

1. Open **Project Settings**. Choose the ![gear icon](_img/icons/gear_icon.png) gear settings icon, and choose **Security**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Open Project Settings>Security, previous nav](_img/view-permissions/open-project-level-security-horz.png)

2. Choose **Create group** to open the dialog for adding a group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Create a custom security group](_img/change-individual-permissions/create-group-open-dialog.png)" 

3. Enter a name for the group, and optionally a description.

    For example, here we define a Team Admins group.

    ![Security group dialog, Add a security group at the project level](_img/change-individual-permissions/create-project-level-group-dialog.png)

4. Choose **Create group**.

## Set permissions for a custom security group

1. To set permissions for the custom group you just created, choose the group name and then set one or more permissions.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Set permissions for a project-level custom security group](_img/change-individual-permissions/team-admin-group-set-permissions.png)  

    For a description of each permission, see [Permissions and groups reference, project-level permissions](permissions.md#project-level-permissions).

2. Choose **Save changes**.

<a id="add-members-custom-group" />

## Add members to a custom security group

You add members to a custom security group in the same way you add users to a built-in group. 

0. Choose the security group, choose **Members**, and then choose **Add**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Security>Members page, Add member](_img/change-individual-permissions/team-admin-group-add-members.png)  

0. Type the name of the user account into the text box. You can type several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system will automatically search for matches. Choose the match(es) that meets your choice.

    ![Add users and group dialog](_img/project-level-permissions-add-a-user.png) 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Users that have limited access, such as Stakeholders, won't be able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

## Change the permission assignments for an individual

### To change the permission at a project-level

1. From the project-level **Security** page, type the name of the user account in the **Filter users and groups** box and select the account whose permissions you want to change.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Filter and select a user account](_img/change-individual-permissions/filter-user-account.png)  

2. Change the permissions for the account, setting a permission as **Allow** or **Deny**.

    ![Set permissions for a single user account](_img/change-individual-permissions/set-individual-permissions.png)  

    For a description of each permission, see [Permissions and groups reference, project-level permissions](permissions.md#project-level-permissions).

3. Choose **Save changes**.

### To change the permission at a collection level

1. Open the account-level or collection-level **Security** admin page and follow the instructions provided in the previous section for project-level permissions.

    For a description of each collection-level permission, see [Permissions and groups reference, collection-level permissions](permissions.md#collection-level).

### To change the permission at an object-level

From the web portal, open the Security dialog for the object whose permissions you want to set. For specific instructions, see these topics:


<table width="80%">
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
<th width="35%">Area</th>
<th width="65%">Task</th>
