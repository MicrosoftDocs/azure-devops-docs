# Look up the organization owner

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Each organization has one and only one owner. The **Organization owner** has permissions to add users, change the access level for a user or group, manage permissions at all levels, and configure and customize all projects defined for the organization.  

To change the **Organization owner**, see [Change organization owner](../accounts/change-organization-ownership.md). 

## Prerequisites

* You must be a member of the **Project Collection Valid Users** group to look up the organization owner or view organization settings. Users added to a project are automatically added to this group.
