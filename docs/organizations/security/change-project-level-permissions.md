# Change project-level permissions 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Many permissions get set at the project level. You can grant these permissions by adding a user or group to the **Project Administrators** group. Or, you can grant specific project-level permissions to a custom security group or to a user. 

Consider adding users to the **Project Administrators** group when they're tasked with adding or managing teams, area and iteration paths, repositories, service hooks, and service end points.

## Project-level permissions 

[!INCLUDE [project-level-permissions](./includes/project-level-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The permission to add or remove project-level security groups and add and manage project-level group membership is assigned to all members of the **Project Administrators** group. It isn't controlled by a permission surfaced within the user interface. 

### Create tag definition permission

By default, members of the **Contributors** group are assigned the **Create tag definition** permission. Although the **Create tag definition** permission appears in the security settings at the project-level, tagging permissions are actually collection-level permissions that are scoped at the project level when they appear in the user interface. To scope tagging permissions to a single project when using a command-line tool, you must provide the GUID for the project as part of the command syntax. Otherwise, your change applies to the entire collection. For more information, see [Security groups, service accounts, and permissions, Work item tags](permissions.md#work-item-tags). 

## Prerequisites

|Category  | Requirements |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Permissions** | Member of the [**Project Administrators** security group](look-up-project-administrators.md). If you created the organization or collection, you're automatically a member of this group. |
| **Directory services** | [Security groups defined in Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory](add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md) before adding them to Azure DevOps. |

> [!NOTE]   
> Users granted **Stakeholder** access can't access select features even if granted permissions to those features. For more information, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](stakeholder-access.md).

## Add members to the Project Administrators group 

You can add users who are associated with a project, organization, or collection to the Project Administrators group. This group has specific permissions at the organizations or collection level. To add a custom security group, first create the group as described in [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md).

Here we show how to add a user to the built-in **Project Administrators** group. The method is similar to adding a Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory group.

## Change permissions for a group 

You can modify project-level permissions for any group associated with a project, except for the **Project Administrators** group. Also, each team that is added to a project is automatically included as a project-level group. To add security groups to a project, see [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md). To understand permission assignments and inheritance, see [About permissions, Permission states](about-permissions.md#permission-states).

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the **Project Permissions Settings Page** preview page, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Open the **Permissions** page as described in the previous section, [Add a user or group to the Project Administrators group](#add-user-group). 

	> [!NOTE]   
	> You can't change the permission settings for the Project Administrators group. This is by design.  

2. From the **Permissions** page, choose the group whose permissions you want to change. 

    For example, we choose the **Contributors** group and change their permissions for **Delete and restore work items** to **Allow**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of Contributors group, permissions, preview page.](media/project-collection/delete-restore-work-items-permissions-s154.png)  

    Your changes are automatically saved. 

    > [!TIP]   
    > If you add a user to the **Contributors** group, they can add and modify work items. You can restrict permissions of users or user groups to add and modify work items based on the **Area Path**. For more information, see [Modify work items under an area path](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path).
