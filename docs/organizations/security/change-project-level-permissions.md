# Change project-level permissions 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Several permissions are set at the project level. You can grant these permissions by adding a user or group to the **Project Administrators** group. Or, you can grant select project-level permissions to a custom security group or to a user. 

Consider adding users to the **Project Administrators** group when they are tasked with adding or managing teams, area and 
iteration paths, repositories, service hooks, and service end points. 
 

See the following articles for related information: 

- [Request an increase in permission levels](request-changes-permissions.md)
- [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md)
- [Look up a project administrator ](look-up-project-administrators.md)
- [Set object-level permissions](set-object-level-permissions.md)
- [Change permissions at the organization or collection-level](change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md)

## Project-level permissions 

[!INCLUDE [project-level-permissions](./includes/project-level-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Contributors are assigned the **Create tag definition** permission. Although the **Create tag definition** permission appears in the security settings at the project-level, tagging permissions are actually collection-level permissions that are scoped at the project level when they appear in the user interface. To scope tagging permissions to a single project when using a command-line tool, you must provide the GUID for the project as part of the command syntax. Otherwise, your change will apply to the entire collection. To learn more about work item tagging permissions, see [Security groups, service accounts, and permissions, Work item tags](permissions.md#work-item-tags). 

## Prerequisites

- To manage permissions or groups at the project level, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** security group. If you created the project, you are automatically added as a member of this group. To get added to this group, you need to request permissions from a member of the **Project Administrators** group. See [Look up a project administrator](look-up-project-administrators.md).
- If want to add security groups defined in Azure Active Directory or Active Directory, make sure those are first defined. To learn more, see [Add AD/Azure AD users or groups to a built-in security group](add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md).

> [!NOTE]   
> Users granted **Stakeholder** access, aren't able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

## Add members to the Project Administrators group 

You can add users who've been added to a project, organization, or collection to the Project Administrators group. To add a custom security group, first create the group as described in [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md).

Here we show how to add a user to the built-in **Project Administrators** group. The method is similar to adding an Azure Active Directory or Active Directory group.

## Change permissions for a group 

You can change the project-level permissions for any project-level group. Each team added to a project is automatically added as a project-level group. To add security groups to a project, see [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md). To understand permission assignments and inheritance, see [About permissions, Permission states](about-permissions.md#permission-states).
    
::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the **Project Permissions Settings Page**, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Open the **Permissions** page as described in the previous section, [Add a user or group to the Project Administrators group](#add-user-group). 

	> [!NOTE]   
	> You can't change the permission settings for the Project Administrators group. This is by design.  

2. From the **Permissions** page, choose the group whose permissions you want to change. 

    For example, here we choose the **Contributors** group, change their permissions for **Delete and restore work items** to **Allow**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of Contributors group, permissions, preview page.](media/project-collection/delete-restore-work-items-permissions-s154.png)  

    Your changes are automatically saved. 

    > [!TIP]   
    > In general, if you add a user to the **Contributors** group, they can add and modify work items. You can restrict permissions of users or user groups to add and modify work items based on the **Area Path**. For details, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking, Modify work items under an area path](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path).

1. Open the **Security** page as described in the previous section, [Add a user or group to the Project Administrators group](#add-user-group). 

1. From the **Security** page, choose the group whose permissions you want to change. 

    For example, here we grant permission to the **Contributors** group to **Delete and restore work items**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
