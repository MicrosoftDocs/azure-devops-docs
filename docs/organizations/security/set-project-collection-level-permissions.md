# Set permissions at the project- or collection-level

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../includes/version-all.md)]

Several permissions are set at the project or at the organization/project collection level. You can grant these permissions by adding a user or group to one of the default security groups listed here. Or, you can create a custom security group within a level and add members to that group. You can then change the default permission settings.

An organization is the container for several projects that share resources. For more information about projects and project collections, see [Plan your organizational structure](../../user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md).

Only add service accounts to [Azure DevOps service account groups](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies). To understand valid user groups, see [About security, membership, and permissions; Valid user groups](about-permissions.md#validusers).

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
* You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, create one in [Azure DevOps](../accounts/set-up-vs.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../accounts/add-organization-users.md). 
  ::: moniker-end  
  ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"  
* You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, create one in an [on-premises TFS](../projects/create-project.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). 
  ::: moniker-end  
* To manage permissions or groups at the project level, you must be a member of the Project Administrators Group. If you created the project, you are automatically added as a member of this group. 
* To manage permissions or groups at the collection or instance level, you must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators Group. If you created the organization or collection, you are automatically added as a member of this group. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Users added to the **Project-Scoped Users** group can't access most **Organization Settings** pages, including Permissions. To learn more, see [About projects and scaling your organization, Project-scoped Users group ](../projects/about-projects.md#project-scoped-user-group).

## Add a user or group to a security group

As roles and responsibilities change, you might need to change the permission levels for individual members of a project. The easiest way to do that is to add the user or a group of users to a pre-defined security group.  If roles change, you can then remove the user from a group.

Here we show how to add a user to the built-in Project Administrators group. The method is similar to adding an Azure Active Directory or Active Directory group.

## Manage group settings 

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the **Project Permissions Settings Page** or the **Organization Permissions Settings Page v2**, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md). Both preview pages provide a group settings page that the current page does not. 

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

You can change a group description, add a group image, or delete a group through the group **Settings** page. 

From the **Project > Settings > Permissions** or **Organization > Settings > Permissions** page, choose the group you want to manage, and then choose **Settings**.  

For example, here we open the Settings for the Work Tracking Administrators group. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Open group settings, preview page.](media/project-collection/group-settings.png) 

You can modify the group name, group description, upload an image, or delete the group.  

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page) 

You can change a group description or add a group image by editing the group profile. Or, delete a group through the group **Delete** menu option. 

### Manage project-level groups 

1. From the **Project > Settings > Security** page, choose the group you want to manage, and choose from the **Edit** menu to either **Edit profile** or **Delete**. 
    For example, here we open the **Edit profile** for the Stakeholder Access group.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Edit group profile](media/project-collection/edit-group-profile-delete-project-level-current.png)   

    . . . and change the description. Note that you can change the name of the group as well.

    > ![Screenshot of Edit group profile description](media/project-collection/edit-project-level-group-current.png)   

1. Choose **Save** to save your changes.

### Manage organization-level groups 

1. From the **Organization > Settings > Security** page, choose the group you want to manage, and hover over the context menu and select **Edit Group** or **Delete Group**.  

    For example, here we open the **Edit Group** for the Work Tracking Administrators group.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of context menu for Custom group](media/project-collection/org-permissions-group-edit-delete-v1.png)

## On-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, see these additional articles: 

- [Add a user as an Azure DevOps Server administrator](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator) 
- [Azure DevOps Server service account groups](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies)

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites. See [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in TFS](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).

## FAQs

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

#### Q: When do I need to add someone to the Project Collection Administrator role?

A: It varies. For most organizations that use Azure DevOps, Project Collection Administrators manage the collections that members of the **Team Foundation Administrators** group create. Members of the **Project Collection Administrators** group don't create the collections themselves. Project collection administrators also do many operations required to maintain the collection. Operations include creating team projects, adding users to groups, modifying the settings for the collection, and so on.

#### Q: What are the optimal permissions to administer a project collection across all of its components and dependencies?

A: Project collection administrators must be members of the following groups or have the following permissions:

- Team Foundation Server: A member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group, or have the appropriate [collection-level permissions](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#collection) set to **Allow**.

- SharePoint Products: If the collection is configured with a site collection resource, then a member of the **Site Collection Administrators** group.

- Reporting Services: If the collection is configured with reporting resources, then a member of the **Team Foundation Content Manager** group.

#### Q: I'm an admin, but I don't have permission to add a Project Collection Administrator. What do I need?

A: The following permissions are required:

- You must be a **Project Collection Administrator**, or your **View Server-Level Information** and **Edit Server-Level Information** permissions must be set to **Allow**.

- To add permissions for SharePoint Products, you must be a member of the **Site Collection Administrators** or **Farm Administrators** groups for SharePoint Products.

- To add permissions for Reporting Services, you must be a member of the **Content Managers** or **Team Foundation Content Managers** groups for Reporting Services.

> [!Important]
> To perform administrative tasks like creating project collections, your user requires administrative permissions. The service account that the Team Foundation Background Job Agent uses must have certain permissions granted to it. For more information, see [Service accounts and dependencies in Team Foundation Server](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies) and [Team Foundation Background Job Agent](/azure/devops/server/architecture/background-job-agent).

::: moniker-end 

#### Q: Where can I find information about each individual permission?

A: You can find detailed information about individual permissions and their relationship to default security groups in the [Permission and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md). To give a user project administration permission, complete the following steps:

1. From the team page, select the settings icon ![Settings icon](media/icons/gear_icon.png) to go to the team administration page.

2. Add the user to the **Project Administrators** group.
