# Set permissions at the project- or collection-level

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Several permissions are set at the project or at the organization/project collection level. You can grant these permissions by adding a user or group to one of the default security groups listed here. Or, you can create a custom security group within a level and add members to that group. You can then change the default permission settings.

An organization is the container for several projects that share resources. For more information about projects and project collections, see [Plan your organizational structure](../../user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md).

Only add service accounts to [TFS service account groups](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies-tfs). To understand valid user groups, see [About permissions and groups, Valid user groups](about-permissions.md#validusers).

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
* You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, create one in [Azure DevOps](../accounts/set-up-vs.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../accounts/add-organization-users.md). 
  ::: moniker-end  
  ::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"  
* You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, create one in an [on-premises TFS](../projects/create-project.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). 
  ::: moniker-end  
* To manage permissions or groups at the project level, you must be a member of the Project Administrators Group or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow. If you created the project, you are automatically added as a member of this group. 
* To manage permissions or groups at the collection or instance level, you must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators Group or have your **Edit instance-level information** set to Allow. If you created the organization or collection, you are automatically added as a member of this group.

## Add a user or group to a security group

As roles and responsibilities change, you might need to change the permission levels for individual members of a project. The easiest way to do that is to add the user or a group of users to a pre-defined security group.  If roles change, you can then remove the user from a group.

Here we show how to add a user to the built-in Project Administrators group. The method is similar to adding an Azure Active Directory or Active Directory group.

## Manage group settings 

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the **Project Permissions Settings Page** or the **Organization Permissions Settings Page v2**, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md). Both preview pages provide a group settings page that the current page does not. 

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

You can change a group description, add a group image, or delete a group through the group **Settings** page. 

From the **Project > Settings > Permissions** or **Organization > Settings > Permissions** page, choose the group you want to manage, and then choose **Settings**.  

For example, here we open the Settings for the Work Tracking Administrators group. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open group settings](_img/project-collection/group-settings.png) 

You can modify the group name, group description, upload an image, or delete the group.  

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page) 

You can change a group description or add a group image by editing the group profile. Or, delete a group through the group **Delete** menu option. 

### Manage project-level groups 

1. From the **Project > Settings > Security** page, choose the group you want to manage, and choose from the **Edit** menu to either **Edit profile** or **Delete**. 
	For example, here we open the **Edit profile** for the Stakeholder Access group.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Edit group profile](_img/project-collection/edit-group-profile-delete-project-level-current.png)   

	. . . and change the description. Note that you can change the name of the group as well. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Edit group profile description](_img/project-collection/edit-project-level-group-current.png)   

1. Choose **Save** to save your changes.

### Manage organization-level groups 

1. From the **Organization > Settings > Security** page, choose the group you want to manage, and hover over the context menu and select **Edit Group** or **Delete Group**.  

	For example, here we open the **Edit Group** for the Work Tracking Administrators group.

## On-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, see these additional topics: 

- [Add a user as a TFS server administrator](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator-tfs) 
- [TFS service account groups](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies-tfs)

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites. See [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in TFS](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).
