# Set permissions at the project- or collection-level

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Several permissions are set at the project or at the organization/project collection level. You can grant these permissions by adding a user or group to one of the default security groups listed here. Or, you can create a custom security group within a level and add members to that group. You can then change the default permission settings.

An organization is the container for several projects that share resources. For more information about projects and project collections, see [Plan your organizational structure](../../user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md).

To understand valid user groups, see [About permissions and groups, Valid user groups](about-permissions.md#validusers).

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="vsts"  
* You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, create one in [Azure DevOps](../accounts/set-up-vs.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../accounts/add-organization-users.md). 
::: moniker-end  
::: moniker range="<= azdevserver-2019"  
* You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, create one in an [on-premises TFS](../projects/create-project.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). 
::: moniker-end  
* To manage permissions or groups at the project level, you must be a member of the Project Administrators Group or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow. If you created the project, you are automatically added as a member of this group. 
* To manage permissions or groups at the collection or instance level, you must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators Group or have your **Edit instance-level information** set to Allow. If you created the organization or collection, you are automatically added as a member of this group.

## Add a user or group to a security group

As roles and responsibilities change, you might need to change the permission levels for individual members of a project. The easiest way to do that is to add the user or a group of users to a pre-defined security group. 

Here we show how to add a user to the built-in Project Administrators group. The method is similar to adding an Azure Active Directory or Active Directory group. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)]  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Security**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Project Settings>Security, Add member](_img/project-level-permissions-add-member.png) 

0. Type the name of the user account into the text box. You can type several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system will automatically search for matches. Choose the match(es) that meets your choice.

## Change the permission level for a project-level group 

0. From the **Security** page, choose the group whose permissions you want to change. 

	For example, here we grant permission to the Contributors group to delete and restore work items.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Contributors group, permissions](_img/project-level-permissions-contributors-group.png)  

	> [!TIP]   
	> In general, if you add a user to the Contributors group, they will be able to add and modify work items. You can restrict permissions of users or user groups to add and modify work items based on the area path. For details, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking, Modify work items under an area path](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path).

	For a description of each permission, see [Permissions and groups reference, project-level permissions](permissions.md#project-level-permissions).

	> [!NOTE]   
	> You can't change the permission settings for the Project Administrators group. This is by design.  

0. Choose **Save changes**.

## On-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, see these additional topics: 

- [Add a user as a TFS server administrator](/tfs/server/admin/add-administrator-tfs) 
- [TFS service account groups](/tfs/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies-tfs)

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites. See [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in TFS](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with a SharePoint product or SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites.
