# Git permissions prior to TFS 2017 Update 1

**TFS 2017** | **TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

In TFS 2017 Update 1 (and Azure DevOps), Git repository permissions have changed.
For those customers using previous versions of TFS, here are the old permissions.
Those using TFS 2017 Update 1 or Azure DevOps should see the [latest list of permissions](permissions.md#git-repository).

These permissions appear only for a project including a Git repository.

Set permissions across all Git repositories by making changes to the top-level **Git repositories** entry.  

Individual repositories inherit permissions from the top-level **Git Repositories** entry.     

Branches inherit permissions from assignments made at the repository level.   

By default, the project level and collection level Readers groups have only Read permissions.

		<td id="git-administer-permission">Administer</td>

			Can rename and delete the repository. If assigned to the top-level **Git repositories** entry, can add additional repositories.

			At the branch level, users can set permissions for the branch and unlock the branch.

				<b>TFS 2013, TFS 2015</b>: The Administer permission set on a individual Git repository does not grant the ability to rename or delete the repository. These tasks require
				Administer permissions at the top-level **Git repositories** entry.

			Can create and publish branches in the repository.<br />
			Lack of this permission does not limit users from creating branches in their local repository;
			it merely prevents them from publishing local branches to the server.<br />
			When a user creates a new branch on the server,
			they have Administer, Contribute, and Force permissions for that branch by default.

			At the repository level, can push their changes to branches in the repository. Does not override restrictions in place from [branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md).
