# View permissions for yourself or others

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

In this article, learn how to view your permissions or the permissions for other users in Azure DevOps. If you don't have permission to access a feature or function, you can request it from the right resource.

You can set and view permissions at the following three levels:
- [Project-level](#view-project-level-permissions)
- [Organization or Collection-level](#view-organization-or-collection-level-permissions)
- [Object-level](#view-object-level-permissions)
 
For more information, see [Get started with permissions, access, and security groups](about-permissions.md).

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Project access** | [Project member](add-users-team-project.md). |
| **Permissions**| Member of the **Project Valid Users** group or **Project Collection Valid Users** group.|

## View project-level permissions

Do the following steps to view project-level permissions for you or other users.

> [!NOTE]   
> To get the new user interface for the **Project Permissions Settings Page**, [enable the preview feature](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Sign in to your project (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization/Your_Project}```).
2. Select **Project settings** > **Permissions**.

3. Select **Users**. To filter the list, enter a name into the *Search users* box.

	:::image type="content" source="media/view-permissions/search-user-name-s154.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows finding a user, preview page.":::

   If your project administration is done using groups, **Expand search** after you begin to enter the user name.

4. Choose the user you want. The project-level permissions for that user display. These permissions are based on the groups the user belongs to or the permissions set specifically for the user's account.

> [!TIP]
> If there's an asterisk (*) next to a 'Deny' permission, it indicates that the denial applies to all child objects or resources under the specified scope. This means that if a user is denied a permission at a higher level, they're also denied that permission for all related resources, regardless of any other permissions that might be granted at lower levels. 
> 
> For example, if a user has 'Deny' permission for 'View project' with an asterisk (*) at the project level, they can't view any of the repositories, boards, or pipelines within that project, even if they are granted 'Allow' permissions at those lower levels.
