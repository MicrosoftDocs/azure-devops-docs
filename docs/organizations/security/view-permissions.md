# View permissions for yourself or others

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../includes/version-all.md)]

Learn how to view your permissions or the permissions that are set for others in Azure DevOps. If you don't have a permission to access a feature or function, you can request it from the right resource.

Permissions are set at the collection, project, and object level as described in [Get started with permissions, access, and security groups](about-permissions.md). So to view the permissions you have, you need to open the permissions at the object, project, or collection level.


> [!NOTE]
> This article shows how to view permissions assigned to a user at the project-level or collection-level. However, the steps are similar when you work from the Security dialog of an object.

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project to connect to. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).
* You must be a member of the Project Valid Users Group or Project Collection Valid Users Group to view permissions.


## View project-level permissions

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the preview feature, for the new user interface for the **Project Permissions Settings Page**, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Permissions**.

	![Open Project settings > Permissions](../settings/media/shared/open-project-settings-permissions-preview.png) 

2. Choose **Users**. To filter the list, enter a name into the *Search groups or users* box.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of find a user or group name, preview page.](media/view-permissions/search-user-name-s154.png) 

3. Choose the name you want. The project-level permissions for that user displays. These permissions are based on the groups the user belongs to or the permissions set specifically for the user's account.    
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Permissions set for a user account](media/view-permissions/user-permissions-s154.png) 

4. Choose **Member of** to see which security groups and teams that the user belongs to.  

    Here we see that *Jamal Hartnett* belongs to several teams and the Project Collection Administrators group for several projects. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Permissions tab, User name, Members tab](media/view-permissions/member-of-view-s154.png)  


#### [Current page](#tab/current-page)

2. Begin entering the name into the *Filter users and groups* box. The system automatically shows the names that begin with the characters you enter.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of find a user or group name, current page.](media/view-permissions/search-user-name-vert-nav.png)  

3. Choose the name you want. The project-level permissions you have set are based on the groups you belong to or the permissions set for your account.      

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Project Administrators Group, Members tab](media/view-permissions/project-level-user-permissions-vsts.png)

## View object-level permissions 

You can define the security or permissions for a number of objects. You access them from the context menu of the object. 

From the web portal, open the Security dialog for the object whose permissions you want to set. For specific instructions, see the following articles:
