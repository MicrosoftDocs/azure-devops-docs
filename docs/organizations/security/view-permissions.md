# View permissions for yourself or others

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Learn how to view your permissions or the permissions that are set for others in Azure DevOps. If you don't have a permission to access a feature or function, you can request it from the right resource.

Permissions are set at the collection, project, and object level as described in [Get started with permissions, access, and security groups](about-permissions.md). So to view the permissions you have, you need to open the permissions at the object, project, or collection level.

> [!NOTE]
> This article shows how to view permissions assigned to a user at the project-level or collection-level. However, the steps are similar when you work from the Security dialog of an object.

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project to connect to. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).
* You must be a member of the Project Valid Users Group or Project Collection Valid Users Group to view permissions.

## View project-level permissions

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the preview feature, for the new user interface for the **Project Permissions Settings Page**, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Permissions**.

	![Open Project settings > Permissions](../settings/media/shared/open-project-settings-permissions-preview.png) 

2. Choose **Users**. To filter the list, enter a name into the *Search groups or users* box.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of find a user or group name, preview page.](media/view-permissions/search-user-name-s154.png) 

3. Choose the name you want. The project-level permissions for that user displays. These permissions are based on the groups the user belongs to or the permissions set specifically for the user's account.    
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Permissions set for a user account](media/view-permissions/user-permissions-s154.png) 

4. Choose **Member of** to see which security groups and teams that the user belongs to.  

    Here we see that *Jamal Hartnett* belongs to several teams and the Project Collection Administrators group for several projects.

    > ![Permissions tab, User name, Members tab](media/view-permissions/member-of-view-s154.png)

2. Begin entering the name into the *Filter users and groups* box. The system automatically shows the names that begin with the characters you enter.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of find a user or group name, current page.](media/view-permissions/search-user-name-vert-nav.png)  

3. Choose the name you want. The project-level permissions you have set are based on the groups you belong to or the permissions set for your account.
