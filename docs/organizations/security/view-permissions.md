# Quickstart: View permissions for yourself or others

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

In this quickstart, you learn how to view your permissions or those defined for another which have been set in Azure DevOps or Team Foundation Server (TFS). That way, if you don't have a permission to access a feature or function, you can request it from the right resource.

Permissions are set at the collection, project, and object level as described in [About permissions and groups](about-permissions.md). So to view the permissions you have, you need to open the permissions at the object, project, or collection level.

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project to connect to. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).
* You must be a member of the Project Valid Users Group or Project Collection Valid Users Group to view permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> This article shows how to view permissions assigned to a user as the project-level or collection-level. However, the steps are similar when you work from the Security dialog of an object.

## View project-level permissions

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)] 

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

0. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Security**.

	[ ![Project Settings>Security](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox)

2. Begin typing the name into the *Filter users and groups* box. The system will automatically show the names that begin with the characters you type.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Find a user or group name](_img/view-permissions/search-user-name-vert-nav.png)  

3. Choose the name you want. The project-level permissions you have set are based on the groups you belong to or those specifically set for your account.      

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Project Administrators Group, Members tab](_img/view-permissions/project-level-user-permissions-vsts.png)  

4. Choose **Member of** to see which security groups the user belongs to.  

	Here we see that *Jamal Hartnett* belongs to several teams as well as the Project Collection Administrators group. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Security tab, User name, Members tab](_img/view-permissions/project-level-member-of-permissions-vsts.png)

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

::: moniker range="vsts"

1. Open **Project Settings**. Choose the ![gear icon](_img/icons/gear_icon.png) gear settings icon, and choose **Security**.

2. Begin typing the name into the *Filter users and groups* box. The system will automatically show the names that begin with the characters you type.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Project level permissions for a user, Azure DevOps](_img/view-permissions/search-user-name-vert-nav.png)  

3. Choose the name you want. The project-level permissions you have set are based on the groups you belong to or those specifically set for your account.      

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

	For a description of each permissions, see [Permissions and groups reference](permissions.md#project-level). 

4. Choose **Member of** to see which security groups the user belongs to.  

	Here we see that *Jamal Hartnett* belongs to several teams as well as the Project Collection Administrators group.

## View object-level permissions 

You can define the security or permissions for a number of objects. You access them from the context menu of the object. 

From the web portal, open the Security dialog for the object whose permissions you want to set. For specific instructions, see the following articles: 

<table width="80%">
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
<th width="35%">Area</th>
<th width="65%">Task</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wiki & Dashboard permissions</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>[README & Wiki](../../project/wiki/manage-readme-wiki-permissions.md)</li>
<li>[Dashboards](../../report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions.md)</li>

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DevOps (code, build, test, release) permissions </td>
