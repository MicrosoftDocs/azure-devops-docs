Set permissions across all Git repositories by making changes to the top-level **Git repositories** entry. Individual repositories inherit permissions from the top-level **Git Repositories** entry. Branches inherit a subset of permissions from assignments made at the repository level. For branch permissions and policies, see [Set branch permissions](/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-permissions) and [Improve code quality with branch policies](/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies).
