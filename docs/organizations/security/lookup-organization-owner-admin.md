# Look up administrators or an organization owner 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

When you need to have your permissions changed or you need to get access to select features or functions, you may need to find out who can grant them. Usually it is an administrator or the account owner.

For an overview of built-in security groups and default permission assignments, see [Default permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).  
* You must be a member of the Project Valid Users Group or Project Collection Valid Users Group to view permissions. Users added to a project are automatically added to these security groups. 

## Show members of the Project Administrators group

If you aren't a Project Administrator, and you need to be, find someone who is, and have them add you. You can find who is a member of the Project Administrators group by choosing that group from the **Project Settings>Security** page and seeing who are members.

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the Project Permissions Settings Page, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to look up members of a Project Administrators group or any other project security group. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Permissions**.

	> ![Project groups](_img/permissions/project-permisions-s154.png)

1. Choose **Project Administrators** group, and then **Members**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Project Settings>Security, Add member](_img/project-collection/project-admin-members-tab-s154.png) 

1. Enter the name of the user account into the text box and then select from the match that appears. You can enter several identities recognized by the system into the **Add users and/or groups** box. The system automatically searches for matches. Choose the matches that meet your choices.

	> [!NOTE]   
	> Users that have limited access, such as Stakeholders, won't be able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

1. Choose **Save**. 

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page) 

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to look up members of a Project Administrators group or any other project security group. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Security**.

## Show members of the Project Collection Administrators group

If you need elevated permissions, you'll have to request them from a member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). Project collection administrators manage features and functions that impact all projects. 


::: moniker range="azure-devops"

To find out who is a member of the Project Collection Administrators group, check the **Permissions** settings at the collection level. 

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the **Organization Permissions Settings Page v2**, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md). The preview page provides a group settings page that the current page does not. 

1. Choose the ![ ](/azure/devops/_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to open **Projects**. Then choose ![gear icon](../../_img/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.
