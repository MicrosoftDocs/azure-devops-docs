# Get started as a Stakeholder

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

Stakeholders are users with free but limited access to Azure DevOps features and functions. With Stakeholder access, you can add and modify work items, manage build and release pipelines, and view dashboards. You can check project status and provide direction, feedback, feature ideas, and business alignment to a team. For a quick overview of the features available to Stakeholders, see the [Features and functions available to Stakeholders](#features) later in this article.

> [!NOTE]   
> For public projects, Stakeholder access gives users greater access to features. To learn more, see [Default roles and access for public projects](../public/default-roles-access-public.md#pipelinesbuild-and-release). For information about working with pipelines, see these articles: [Build your GitHub repository](../../pipelines/get-started-yaml.md) and [Build OSS repositories](../../pipelines/build/ci-public.md).

Stakeholder access is one of several supported access levels as described in [About access levels](access-levels.md#stakeholder-access). 
 

> [!NOTE]   
> Azure Boards supports several Agile methods such as Kanban and Scrum. Depending on what methods your team uses, you'll want to become familiar with other tools that Azure Boards supports. This article focuses on getting familiar with work items and the Kanban board. For additional information, see [Related articles](#related-articles) at the end of this article.

Use this tutorial to learn how to do the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Sign in to a project
> * Understand which work item types are available to your project
> * Open the Kanban board and add a work item
> * Add details, tags, or comments to a work item
> * View the product backlog 
> * Find work assigned to you, or query for other work items
> * Understand what features are and aren't available to users with Stakeholder access



## Connect to the web portal of a project 

You must have been added to the Azure DevOps project and been granted Stakeholder or higher access level. 

1. Choose the link provided in the email invitation you should have received. Or, open a browser window and enter the URL for the web portal.
	::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
	`https://dev.azure.com/OrganizationName/ProjectName`
	::: moniker-end
	::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"
  	`http://ServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/ProjectName`  	
  	For example, to connect to the server named *FabrikamPrime* and project named *Contoso*, enter ```http://FabrikamPrime:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/Contoso```.
	::: moniker-end

2. Enter your credentials. If you can't sign in, ask the organization owner or Project Administrator to add you as a member of the project with Stakeholder access.

## Understand work items and work item types

Work items support planning and tracking work. Each work item represents an object stored in the work item data store. Each work item is based on a work item type and is assigned an identifier which is unique within an organization or project collection.  Different work items are used to track different types of work as described in [About work items](../../boards/work-items/about-work-items.md). The work item types available to you are based on the [process used when your project was created](../../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md)&mdash;Agile, Basic, Scrum, or CMMI&mdash;as illustrated in the following images.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../boards/_shared/work-item-types.md)]


## Open your Kanban board from the web portal

You can start viewing and adding work items once you connect to a project. The easiest way to add work items is through the backlog or Kanban board.  Here we show how to add work through a Kanban board. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. Check that you selected the right project, and select **Boards** > **Boards**. Then select the correct team from the team selector menu. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open your Kanban board](/azure/devops/boards/boards/_img/quickstart/open-kanban-board-agile-s155.png)  

	To select another team's board, open the selector. Then select a different team, or select the ![home icon](/azure/devops/_img/icons/home-icon.png) **Browse all team boards** option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Select another team's board](/azure/devops/boards/boards/_img/quickstart/select-kanban-team-board.png) 

	> [!TIP]    
	> Select the ![ ](/azure/devops/_img/icons/icon-favorite-star.png) star icon to make a team board a favorite. Favorite artifacts (![ ](/azure/devops/_img/icons/icon-favorited.png) favorite icon) appear at the top of the team selector list.

1. Check that you selected **Stories** for Agile, **Issues** for Basic, **Backlog items** for Scrum, or **Requirements** for CMMI as the backlog level. 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Select product backlog level, Backlog items, Stories, or Requirements](/azure/devops/boards/sprints/_img/assign-items-sprint/select-product-backlog-agile.png)

## Add work items to a product backlog 

From the Kanban board, you can add work items. However, with Stakeholder access, you can't update the status of a work item by drag and drop to a different column. 

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

1. From the User Stories board, choose **New item** and start adding those stories you want to track. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Add new item](../../boards/get-started/_img/plan-track-work/new-user-story-kanban-board.png) 

1. Enter return and the system assigns a work item ID to the user story. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Added item](../../boards/get-started/_img/plan-track-work/users-stories-board-added-item.png) 

2. Add as many user stories that you want to track. 

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

1. From the Issues board, choose **New item** and start adding those issues you want to track. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Add new item](../../boards/get-started/_img/track-issues/issues-board-new-item.png) 

2. Enter return and the system assigns a work item ID to the issue. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Added item](../../boards/get-started/_img/track-issues/issues-board-added-item.png) 

3. Add as many issues that you want to track.  

#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

1. From the Product Backlog Items board, choose **New item** and start adding those Product Backlog Items you want to track. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Add new item](../../boards/_shared/_img/add-new-item-kanban-scrum.png) 

2. Enter return and the system assigns a work item ID to the issue. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Added item](../../boards/_shared/_img/new-kanban-item-added-scrum.png) 

3. Add as many product backlog items that you want to track.  


#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 

1. From the Issues board, choose **New item** and start adding those issues you want to track. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Add new item](../../boards/_shared/_img/add-new-item-kanban-cmmi.png) 

2. Enter return and the system assigns a work item ID to the issue. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Added item](../../boards/_shared/_img/new-kanban-item-added-cmmi.png) 

3. Add as many requirements that you want to track.

## Add details to a work item

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017" 

To add information to a work item, open it by double-clicking the title or by selecting it and then typing Enter. Change one or more field values, add a description, [add a tag](#tag), or add a comment in the [**Discussion** section](#discussion). You can also choose the ![attachments icon](../../boards/_img/icons/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png) **Attachments** tab and drag-and-drop or upload a file to share with others.  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015" 

To add information to a work item, open it by double-clicking the title or by selecting it and then typing Enter. Add a description, change one or more field values, or [add a tag](#tag). You can also choose the ![attachments icon](../../boards/_img/icons/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png) **Attachments** tab and upload a file to the work item to share with others.

## Add tags to a work item

Tags are useful for filtering backlogs, boards, and queries. As a Stakeholder, you can add existing tags to a work item, however, you can't add new tags. 

From the web portal, open a work item and choose **Add tag** and type a keyword of an existing tag. Or, select from the list of previously assigned tags.

## Check the backlog and prioritized work  

You can check the product backlog to see how the team has prioritized work. Backlog items appear in priority order. Work item types may include bugs depending on the settings made for the team. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

From the Kanban board, choose **View as backlog**.

## Features and functions available to Stakeholders

With Stakeholder access, users can create and modify work items and create and save queries. They have limited access to many of the Azure Boards features. They also can view and approve release pipelines and perform administrative tasks when granted administrative permissions or added to an administrative group. 
 
> [!NOTE]
> Stakeholders that choose a feature that's not available to them may in some instances receive an error message indicating that they don't have permissions to complete a task.

### Public versus private feature access

Stakeholder access grants access to features differently depending on whether you're working from a private or a public project. To learn more about public projects, see [What is a public project?](../public/about-public-projects.md).
