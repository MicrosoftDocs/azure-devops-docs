# Get started as a Stakeholder

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

With Stakeholder access, you can add and modify work items, manage build and release pipelines, and view dashboards. You can check project status and provide direction, feedback, feature ideas, and business alignment to a team. Stakeholder access is one of several supported access levels. To understand the full set of features Stakeholders have access to, see [About access levels](access-levels.md#stakeholder-access).

> [!NOTE]   
> For public projects, Stakeholder access gives users greater access to work tracking features. To learn more, see [Default roles and access for public projects](../public/default-roles-access-public.md#pipelinesbuild-and-release).

## First time signing in

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013"

1. Choose the link provided in the email invitation you should have received. Or, open a browser window and enter the URL for the web portal.
	::: moniker range="vsts"  
	`http://dev.azure.com/OrganizationName/ProjectName`
	::: moniker-end
	::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
  	`http://ServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/ProjectName`  	
  	For example, to connect to the server named *FabrikamPrime* and project named *Contoso*, type ```http://FabrikamPrime:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/Contoso```.
	::: moniker-end

2.  Enter your credentials. If you aren't able to sign in, ask the organization owner or project administrator to add you as a member of the project with Stakeholder access.

> [!TIP]    
> Use the [Work Items page](../../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md) which supports personalized views of work items assigned to you or ones you've recently viewed or updated. Also, you can add work items from this page.

## View and add work items
You can start viewing and adding work items once you connect to a project.

For descriptions of each field, see [Work item field index](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md). 

You can [add existing tags to any work item to support filter backlogs and queries](../../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md).

> [!NOTE]    
> Depending on the process chosen when the project was created, the types of work items you can create will differ. For example, backlog items may be called user stories ([Agile](../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process-workflow.md)), product backlog items ([Scrum](../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process-workflow.md)), or requirements ([CMMI](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process-workflow.md)). All three are similar&mdash;they describe the customer value to deliver and the work to be performed. For an overview of all three processes, see [Choose a process](../../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).
