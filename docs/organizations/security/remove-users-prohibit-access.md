# Remove user accounts

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

When a user with access to Azure DevOps or Team Foundation Server (TFS) leaves a company, an administrator would typically remove them from Azure Active Directory or Active Directory. This will automatically void their user account and remove their ability to access or connect to Azure DevOps.

If you manage your Azure DevOps users with Microsoft Service Accounts (MSA), then you'll need to [remove their account](../accounts/delete-organization-users.md).

## Consider when removing users

* Have you granted users any paid extensions? You'll want to [transfer those extensions to another user](../accounts/delete-organization-users.md). 
* Do users have any tokens that you need to revoke?
* Have you granted individual user accounts special permissions that need to be revoked? 
* Have you reassigned work users you are removing to current team members?

## Remove users from an organization in Azure DevOps

If your organization uses MSA accounts, then to you must remove users from the organization as you have no other way to prevent access. When you do so, you'll not be able to create a query for work items assigned to the removed user account. To learn more, see [Delete users from Azure DevOps](../accounts/delete-organization-users.md).

If your organization is backed by Azure AD, then you can disable or delete the Azure AD user account while leaving their Azure DevOps account active. In this way, you can continue to query their work item history using their account name.
