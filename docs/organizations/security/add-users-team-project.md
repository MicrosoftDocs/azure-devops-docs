# Add users to a project or team

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

In this quickstart, learn how to add users to a project or specific team. For anyone to access a project, they must be added to one of the default security groups or a custom group. Usually you add them to the Contributors group. For a quick look at what permissions are assigned to the default groups, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

The easiest way to add a number of users to a project is to add groups defined in [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Active Directory (AD)](setup-ad-aad.md).


::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're adding users to an organization in Azure DevOps and you don't use Azure AD, then you need to [add their "personal" Microsoft accounts to your account or project](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md#invite-others). After you've added them to one project, you can add them to additional projects using the procedures provided in this article.

::: moniker-end

Once users have been added to a project, you can browse for their display name or user name (email alias). Also, you can [add them to a specific team](#add-team-members). To add a team, see [Add a team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md).

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).
* To add users to a project, you must be a member of the [Project Administrators group or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). You can add Stakeholders to the Project Administrators group and then they can add users to an organization or project. 
* To add users to a team, you must be [added as a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md), or you must be a member of the Project Administrators Group, or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow.

## Add users to a project

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
If you are adding a user to Azure DevOps for the first time, see [Add account users for Azure DevOps](../accounts/add-organization-users.md?toc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/breadcrumb/toc.json).

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the Project Permissions Settings Page, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project settings** and then **Permissions**.

	![Open Project settings, and then Permissions](../settings/_img/_shared/open-project-settings-permissions-preview.png)

3. Under **Groups**, choose one of the following options:
   - **Readers**: To add users who require read-only access to the project, choose .
   - **Contributors**: To add users who contribute fully to this project or who have been granted Stakeholder access.
   - **Project Administrators**: To add users who need to administrate the project. To learn more, see [Set permissions at the project-level or project collection-level](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).

   Here we choose the **Contributors** group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Security page, Contributors group](_img/add-users/open-contributors-groups-s154-new.png) 

4. Next, choose the **Members** tab.

   By default, the default team group and any other teams you add to the project, are included as members of the **Contributors** group. Add a new user as a member of a team instead, and the user automatically inherits Contributor permissions. 

    > [!TIP]
    > Managing users is much easier [using groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md), not individual users.

5. Choose **Add** to add a user or a user group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Security page, Contributors group, Members page, Add button](_img/add-users/add-users-to-contributors-s154.png) 

6. Enter the name of the user account into the text box. You can enter several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system automatically searches for matches. Choose the match(es) that meet your requirements.

	![Add users and group dialog](_img/add-users/invite-members-contributors-s154.png)  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The first time you add a user or group to Azure DevOps,
   > you can't browse to it or check the friendly name.
   > After the identity has been added, you can just enter the friendly name.

	Choose **Save** when done. 

7. You may customize user permissions for other functionality in the project. For example, in [areas and iterations](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or [shared queries](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Users that have limited access, such as Stakeholders, won't be able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page) 

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

5. Choose ![gear icon](../../_img/icons/add-light-icon.png)**Add** to add a user or a user group.

6. Enter the name of the user account into the text box. You can enter several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system automatically searches for matches. choose the match(es) that meet your requirements.

## Add users to a team

Several Agile tools, like capacity planning, team alerts, and dashboard widgets are team-scoped. That is, they automatically reference the user accounts added as members of a team to support planning activities or sending alerts. To learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](../settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).
