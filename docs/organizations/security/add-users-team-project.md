# Add users or groups to a team or project

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You add users to a team or project so they can contribute to the team and project. For enterprise organizations with large user bases, we recommend you use Azure Active Directory to add and manage new users through security groups. However, to enable flexibility for all size organizations, the following operations are supported: 
 
- Team and project administrators can add new users to their team or project, unless the policy [Allow team and project administrators to invite new users](restrict-invitations.md) is disabled. New users are ones that haven't been added to the organization. 
- When adding new users through the team and project user interfaces, the system automatically assigns an access level to the user. 
- Adding users to a team or project automatically adds them to the Contributors group for the project. Members of the Contributors group have permissions to most features needed to contribute.
- By adding users to a team, you make team-specific tools aware of them, such as the team security group, Team Members widget, and sprint capacity planning tools. 
- Once users have been added to a project or organization, you can browse for their display name or user name (email alias) from any people-picker tool.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/prerequisites-add-users-org.md)]

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/prerequisites-add-users-server.md)]

If you're new to Azure DevOps, you may want to familiarize yourself with the information provided in these articles: 

- [Get started with permissions, access levels, and security groups](about-permissions.md)  
- [About projects and scaling your organization](../projects/about-projects.md)  
- [Default permissions and access quick reference](permissions-access.md)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

## Add a user from the Team Members widget  

As a team administrator, you can add new or existing members from the **Team Members** dashboard widget. To add this widget to a dashboard, see [Add widgets to a dashboard](../../report/dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md). 
 
1. To invite someone to your team, choose the plus button on the Team Members widget. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/add-users/team-member-widget.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Team Members widget added to a dashboard, plus icon.":::

2. For new users, enter their email address. For existing users, type their name until it resolves as a known name to the system. You can add several email addresses or account names by separating them with a semicolon (;). 
	:::row:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      Choose the entry listed under **Add users** to complete the entry.  
	      > [!NOTE]  
	      > Any valid email address is acceptable. When the user accepts the invitation and signs into Azure DevOps, they register their email address as a Microsoft account and choose a password.   
	   :::column-end:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      Choose the name that appears to complete the entry.   
	   :::column-end:::
	:::row-end:::
	:::row:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/invite-members-dialog.png" alt-text="Invite members to a team dialog, enter an unknown user email address.":::
	   :::column-end:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/invite-members-known-user.png" alt-text="Invite members to a team dialog, enter a known user account.":::
	   :::column-end:::
	:::row-end:::

2. Complete the addition.  
	:::row:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      When the user is unknown, you'll get a notification that an access level must be assigned. To complete the invitation, choose **Add**.    
	   :::column-end:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      Choose **Add** to complete adding the user. Known users don't receive an invitation.     
	   :::column-end:::
	:::row-end:::
	:::row:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/invite-members-dialog-add-info.png" alt-text="Invite members to a team dialog, Add new user account. ":::

	   :::column-end:::
	:::row-end:::

	 When adding a new user, the system assigns Stakeholder as the access level when all free five Basic access levels have been assigned. Active contributors to a project need to have Basic access as a minimum. A Project Collection Administrator can change the access level and resend invitations from the [**Organization Settings>Users** page](#manage-users).  

	 > [!NOTE]
	 > Users that have limited access, such as Stakeholders, won't be able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

1. (Optional) A message will briefly display on the screen to indicate success or failure. Choose **Details** to open the notification and review details. 

	:::row:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      :::image type="content" source="media/add-users/notification-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot of notification success message. ":::

	   :::column-end:::
	:::row-end:::
	:::row:::
	   :::column span="":::
	     A success message indicates the status of adding the user to the system. 
	   :::column-end:::
	   :::column span="":::
	      A failure message indicates why the addition of the user failed. 
	   :::column-end:::
	:::row-end:::

## Add users or groups to a project

As a member of the **Project Administrators** group, you can add users or groups to a project from the **Project settings> Permissions** page by adding them to a security group. To add a custom security group, see [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md).

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project settings**, and then **Permissions**. 

	![...](media/permissions/project-settings-permissions.png)

3. Under **Groups**, choose one of the following options:
   - **Readers**: To add users who require read-only access to the project, choose.
   - **Contributors**: To add users who contribute fully to this project or who have been granted Stakeholder access.
   - **Project Administrators**: To add users who need to administrate the project. To learn more, see [Change project-level permissions](change-project-level-permissions.md).

	Or, you can choose any team group to add users to a specific team. 

   Here we choose the **Contributors** group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Security page, Contributors group](media/add-users/open-contributors-groups-s154-new.png) 

4. Next, choose the **Members** tab.

   The default team group, and any other teams you add to the project, get included as members of the **Contributors** group. Add a new user as a member of a team instead, and the user automatically inherits Contributor permissions. 

    > [!TIP]
    > Managing users is much easier [using groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md), not individual users.

5. Choose **Add** to add a user or a user group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Security page, Contributors group, Members page, Add button](media/add-users/add-users-to-contributors-s154.png) 

6. Enter the name of the user account into the text box. You can enter several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system automatically searches for matches. Choose the match(es) that meets your requirements.

	![Add users and group dialog.](media/add-users/invite-members-contributors-s154.png)  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The first time you add a user or group to Azure DevOps,
   > you can't browse to it or check the friendly name.
   > After the identity has been added, you can just enter the friendly name.

	Choose **Save** when done. 

7. You may customize user permissions for other functionality in the project. For example, in [areas and iterations](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or [shared queries](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md).
