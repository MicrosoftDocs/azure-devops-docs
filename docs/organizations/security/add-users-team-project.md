# Quickstart: Add users to a project or specific team

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

In this quickstart, you learn how to add users to a project or specific team. For anyone to access a project, they must be added to one of the default security groups or a custom group. Usually you add them to the Contributors group. For a quick look at what permissions are assigned to the default groups, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

The easiest way to add a number of users to a project is to add groups defined in [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Active Directory (AD)](setup-ad-aad.md).


::: moniker range="vsts"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're adding users to an organization in Azure DevOps and you don't use Azure AD, then you need to [add their "personal" Microsoft accounts to your account or project](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md#invite-others). After you've added them to one project, you can add them to additional projects using the procedures provided in this article.

::: moniker-end

Once users have been added to a project, you can browse for that name by display name as well as their user name (email alias). Also, you can [add them to a specific team](#add-team-members). To add a team, see [Add a team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md).

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).
* To add users to a project, you must be a member of the [Project Administrators group or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). Note that you can add Stakeholders to the Project Administrators group and then they can add users to an organization or project. 
* To add users to a team, you must have been [added as a team administrator for the team](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md), or you must be a member of the Project Administrators Group or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow.

## Add users to a project

::: moniker range="vsts"  
If you are adding a user to Azure DevOps for the first time, see [Add account users for Azure DevOps](../accounts/add-organization-users.md?toc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/breadcrumb/toc.json).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)]  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Security**.

	*To see the full image, click to expand*.

	[ ![Project Settings>Security](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox) 

0. Under **Groups**, choose one of the following:
   * To add users who will require read-only access to the project, choose **Readers**.
   * To add users who will contribute fully to this project or who have been granted stakeholder access, choose **Contributors**.
   * For users who will need to administrate the project, choose **Project Administrators**. To learn more, see  [Set permissions at the project-level or project collection-level](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).

0. Next, choose the **Members** tab.

   Here we choose the **Contributors** group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Security page, Contributors group, Membership page](_img/add-users/add-members-to-contributors-group.png)  

   By default, the default team group and all other teams you add to the project are included as members of the **Contributors** group. So, you can choose to add a new user as a member of a team instead, and the user would automatically inherit Contributor permissions. 

    > [!TIP]
    > Managing users is much easier [using groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md), not individual users.

0. Choose ![gear icon](../../_img/icons/add-light-icon.png)**Add** to add a user or a user group.

0. Type the name of the user account into the text box. You can type several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system will automatically search for matches. choose the match(es) that meet your requirements.

	![Add users and group dialog](_img/project-level-permissions-add-a-user.png)  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The first time you add a user or group to Azure DevOps or TFS,
   > you can't browse to it or check the friendly name.
   > After the identity has been added, you can just type the friendly name.

6. In **Identities**, specify the name of the user or group you want to add.

7. Depending on the user, you might want to customize their permissions for other functionality in the project, such as [areas and iterations](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or [shared queries](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Users that have limited access, such as Stakeholders, won't be able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

## Add users to a team

Several Agile tools, like capacity planning, team alerts, and dashboard widgets are team-scoped. That is, they automatically reference the user accounts added as members of a team to support planning activities or sending alerts. To learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](../settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

## Add users or groups to an access level   

For on-premises deployments, you may need to set the access level for a user or group, particularly if those groups don't belong to the default access level. To learn more, see [Change access levels](change-access-levels.md).

## Add users or groups to SQL Server Reports 

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites. See [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in TFS](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).

## Add users or groups to SharePoint or SQL Server Reports 

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with a SharePoint product or SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites.

* [Set SharePoint site permissions](../../organizations/security/set-sharepoint-permissions.md)
* [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in TFS](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md)
