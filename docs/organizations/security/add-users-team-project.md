# Add users to a project or team

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

In this quickstart, you learn how to add users to a project or specific team. For anyone to access a project, they must be added to one of the default security groups or a custom group. Usually you add them to the Contributors group. For a quick look at what permissions are assigned to the default groups, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

The easiest way to add a number of users to a project is to add groups defined in [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Active Directory (AD)](setup-ad-aad.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're adding users to an organization in Azure DevOps and you don't use Azure AD, then you need to [add their "personal" Microsoft accounts to your account or project](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md#invite-others). After you've added them to one project, you can add them to additional projects using the procedures provided in this article.

Once users have been added to a project, you can browse for their display name or user name (email alias). Also, you can [add them to a specific team](#add-team-members). To add a team, see [Add a team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md).

## Prerequisites

* You must have a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).
* To add users to a project, you must be a member of the [Project Administrators group or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). You can add Stakeholders to the Project Administrators group and then they can add users to an organization or project. 
* To add users to a team, you must be [added as a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md), or you must be a member of the Project Administrators Group, or have your **Edit project-level information** set to Allow.

## Add users to a project

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
If you are adding a user to Azure DevOps for the first time, see [Add account users for Azure DevOps](../accounts/add-organization-users.md?toc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/breadcrumb/toc.json).

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Security**.

	*To see the full image, click to expand*.

	[![Project Settings>Security](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox) 

1. Under **Groups**, choose one of the following options:
   * To add users who require read-only access to the project, choose **Readers**.
   * To add users who contribute fully to this project or who have been granted Stakeholder access, choose **Contributors**.
   * For users who need to administrate the project, choose **Project Administrators**. To learn more, see  [Set permissions at the project-level or project collection-level](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).

1. Next, choose the **Members** tab.

   Here we choose the **Contributors** group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Security page, Contributors group, Membership page](_img/add-users/add-members-to-contributors-group.png)  

   By default, the default team group and any other teams you add to the project, are included as members of the **Contributors** group. Add a new user as a member of a team instead, and the user automatically inherits Contributor permissions. 

    > [!TIP]
    > Managing users is much easier [using groups](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md), not individual users.

1. Choose ![gear icon](../../_img/icons/add-light-icon.png)**Add** to add a user or a user group.

2. Enter the name of the user account into the text box. You can enter several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system automatically searches for matches. choose the match(es) that meet your requirements.

	![Add users and group dialog](_img/project-level-permissions-add-a-user.png)  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The first time you add a user or group to Azure DevOps,
   > you can't browse to it or check the friendly name.
   > After the identity has been added, you can just enter the friendly name.

2. In **Identities**, specify the name of the user or group you want to add.

3. Depending on the user, you may customize their permissions for other functionality in the project. For example, in [areas and iterations](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or [shared queries](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > Users that have limited access, such as Stakeholders, won't be able to access select features even if granted permissions to those features. To learn more, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

## Add users to a team

Several Agile tools, like capacity planning, team alerts, and dashboard widgets are team-scoped. That is, they automatically reference the user accounts added as members of a team to support planning activities or sending alerts. To learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](../settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

You add team members from **Project Settings>Work>Team configuration**. You can quickly navigate to it from a team work tracking backlog, board, or dashboard. 

1. Open a backlog or board for a team and choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/team.png) team profile icon. Then choose **Team Settings**. 

   Here we open the Board for the Web team and from there the team profile.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Work Backlog or Board, choose team profile icon](../settings/_img/team-defaults/open-team-profile-choose-team-settings.png)  

1. If you need to switch the team context, use the team selector within the breadcrumbs.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Team Configuration, Team breadcrumb](../settings/_img/team-defaults/select-team-context.png) 

2. Choose **Add**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Team Profile, choose Add](_img/add-users/team-profile-choose-add.png)   

3. Enter the sign-in addresses or display name for each account you want to add. Add them one at a time or all at the same time. You can enter several identities into the text box, separated by commas.

	![Add users and group dialog](_img/project-level-permissions-add-a-user.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > You must enter user and group names one at a time. However, after entering a name, the account is added to the list, and you can enter another name in the Identities text box before choosing to save your changes.

	You may need to choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/refresh.png) refresh icon to see your updates. 

4. To remove members, return to this page, highlight the user name and choose **Remove**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Team profile page, remove a team member, new nav](_img/add-users/team-page-remove-team-member-vert.png)   

   > [!NOTE]
   > To remove a team administrator as a team member, you must first remove them as an administrator. 

5. To add an account as a team administrator, choose **Add** located in the Team Profile page. For details, see [Add a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md).

## Add users or groups to an access level   

For on-premises deployments, you may need to set the access level for a user or group, particularly if those groups don't belong to the default access level. To learn more, see [Change access levels](change-access-levels.md).

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018 < azure-devops"
## Add users or groups to SQL Server Reports 

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites. See [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in Azure DevOps](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).

## Add users or groups to SharePoint or SQL Server Reports 

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with a SharePoint product or SQL Server Reports, you need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites.
