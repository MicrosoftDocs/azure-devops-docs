- Create and manage all projects in the organization or collection
- Create and manage all Inherited processes defined for a collection
- Install and uninstall extensions
- Add members and groups to the **Project Collection Administrators** group or any other project-level group
- Manage permissions at all levels.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops"  
- Add users to a collection

To add members to the **Project Collection Administrators** group or change a project collection-level permission see [Change project collection-level permissions](change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md). 

For a description of each project collection-level group, see [Security groups, service accounts, and permissions, Collection-level groups](permissions.md#collection-level-groups). To understand how security groups are used to manage permissions, see [Get started with permissions, access, and security groups](about-permissions.md).   

## Prerequisites

* You must be a member of the **Project Collection Valid Users** group to look up members of the **Project Collection Administrators** group. Users added to a project are automatically added to this group. 
 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
> [!NOTE]  
> Users added to the **Project-Scoped Users** group won't be able to access **Organization Settings** other than the **Overview** section if the **Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects** preview feature is enabled for the organization. To learn more, see [Manage your organization, Limit  user visibility for projects and more](../../user-guide/manage-organization-collection.md#project-scoped-user-group).
