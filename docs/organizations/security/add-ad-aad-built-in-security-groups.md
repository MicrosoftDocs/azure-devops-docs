# Add AD/Azure AD users or groups to a built-in security group

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

As described in [About security and identity](about-security-identity.md), there are two main types of built-in security groups: project-level and collection-level. In general, you add users and groups to a project-level group such as Contributors and Readers. For users that will need to administrate select features and functions, you add them or associated groups to the Build Administrators or Project Administrators group.

Review [Default permissions and access](permissions-access.md) to gain insight into the default permissions provided to the built-in, project-level security groups.  

In this topic you'll learn how to:

The method for adding a user or group to a built-in security group is the same, no matter at what level you add them.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you are adding a user to Azure DevOps for the first time, see [Add users for Azure DevOps](../accounts/add-organization-users.md?toc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/organizations/security/breadcrumb/toc.json).

1. Open the web portal and choose the project where you want to add users or groups. To choose another project, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

2. Choose **Project Settings** and then **Security**.

	[ ![Project Settings>Security](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](_img/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox)  

0. Open **Security** and under the **Groups** section, choose one of the following:
    - To add users who will require read-only access to the project, choose **Readers**.
    - To add users who will contribute fully to this project or who have been granted stakeholder access, choose **Contributors**.
    - For users who will need to administrate the project, choose **Project Administrators**.

0. Next, choose the **Members** tab.

	Here we choose the **Contributors** group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Admin context, Security page, Contributors group, Membership page](_img/add-users/add-members-to-contributors-group.png)  

	By default, the default team group and all other teams you add to the project are included as members of the Contributors group. So, you can choose to [add a new user as a member of a team](add-users-team-project.md#add-team-members) instead, and the user would automatically inherit Contributor permissions. 

0. Choose ![ ](../../_img/icons/add-light-icon.png)**Add** to add a user or a user group.

0. Enter the name of the user into the text box. You can type several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system will automatically search for matches. Choose the match(es) that meets your choice.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The first time you add a user or group, 
	> you can't browse to it or check the friendly name.
	> After the identity has been added, you can just type the friendly name.
