# Add an Active Directory / Microsoft Entra group to a built-in security group

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

In this article, learn how to manage large user groups by adding Microsoft Entra groups to built-in security groups in Azure DevOps. As outlined in [About security, authentication, and authorization](about-security-identity.md), there are two main types of built-in security groups: project-level and collection-level. Typically, you add groups to project-level groups like Contributors and Readers. For more information, see [Default permissions and access](permissions-access.md).

The process for adding a Microsoft Entra group to a built-in security group is the same, no matter the access level at which you add them.

## Add Microsoft Entra group to a built-in security group 

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the **Project Permissions Settings Page** preview page, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Sign in to your project (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization/Your_Project}```).

2. Select **Project settings** > **Permissions**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot shows highlighted selections, Project settings and Permissions buttons.](media/permissions/choose-project-settings-permissions.png)

3. Do one of the following actions:
    - Select **Readers** to add users who require read-only access to the project.
    - Select **Contributors** to add users who need full contribution access or Stakeholder access.
    - Select **Project Administrators** to add users who need administrative access to the project.
   
   In the following example, we select the **Contributors** group.
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Screenshot shows highlighted Contributors group selection.](media/add-users/selected-contributors.png)  

4. Select **Members** > **Add**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Screenshot shows highlighted Members tab for Contributors group.](media/add-users/selected-members-in-contributor-group.png)  

	The default team group and all other teams you add to the project are included as members of the Contributors group. So, you can choose to [add a new user as a member of a team](add-users-team-project.md#add-team-members) instead, and the user automatically inherits Contributor permissions.

5. Enter the group name into the text box. You can enter multiple identities, separated by commas. The system automatically searches for matches. Select the matching identity or identities that meet your criteria.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Screenshot shows the Invite members group dialog.](media/add-users/invite-members-to-contributors-group.png)  

	> [!NOTE]
	> The first time you add a group, you can't browse for it or check the friendly name. After adding the identity, you can enter the friendly name directly.

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page)

1. Sign in to your project (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization/Your_Project}```).

2. Select **Project settings** > **Security**.

	[![Screenshot show selections, Project settings, Security page.](media/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](media/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox)  

3. Do one of the following actions:
    - Select **Readers** to add users who require read-only access to the project.
    - Select **Contributors** to add users who need full contribution access or Stakeholder access.
    - Select **Project Administrators** to add users who need administrative access to the project.

4. Select **Members**.

	Here we choose the **Contributors** group.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot shows Admin context, Security page, Contributors group, Membership page selections.](media/add-users/add-members-to-contributors-group.png)  

	The default team group and all other teams you add to the project are included as members of the Contributors group. So, you can choose to [add a new user as a member of a team](add-users-team-project.md#add-team-members) instead, and the user automatically inherits Contributor permissions. 

5. Choose :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/add-light-icon.png" border="false":::**Add** to add a group.

6. Enter the name of the user into the text box. You can enter several identities into the text box, separated by commas. The system automatically searches for matches. Choose the match that meets your choice.

	![Screenshot showing the Add users and group dialog.](media/project-level-permissions-add-a-user.png)  

	> [!TIP]
	> The first time you add a group, you can't browse or check the friendly name.
	> After you add the identity, you can enter the friendly name directly.

2. Choose **Project Settings**, and then **Security**.

	[![Screenshot of Project Settings>Security selections.](media/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert.png)](media/view-permissions/open-security-project-level-vert-expanded.png#lightbox)  

3. Select **Security** and under the **Groups** section, and then do one of the following actions:
    - Select **Readers** to add users who require read-only access to the project.

    - Select **Project Administrators** to add users who need administrative access to the project.

	The default team group and all other teams you add to the project are included as members of the Contributors group. So, you can choose to [add a new user as a member of a team](add-users-team-project.md#add-team-members) instead, and the user automatically inherits Contributor permissions. 

5. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/add-light-icon.png" border="false":::**Add** to add a group.
