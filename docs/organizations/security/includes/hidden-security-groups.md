> [!NOTE]  
> All security groups are organization-level entities, even those groups that only have permissions to a specific project. From the web portal, users without access to a project can't see those groups which only have permissions to a specific project. However, you can discover the names of all groups in an organization using the **azure devops** CLI tool or our REST APIs. To learn more, see [Add and manage security groups](/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-manage-security-groups).
