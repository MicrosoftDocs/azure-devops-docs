<!--- project-level permissions for cloud version, old layout ---> 

:::row:::
   :::column span="2":::
   ### Permission (UI)   
   `Namespace permission`  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
  ### Description 
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="2":::
   <a id="bypass-rules-permission"></a> Bypass rules on work item updates  
   `Project, BYPASS_RULES`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
   Users with this permission can save a work item that ignores rules, such as [copy, constraint, or conditional rules](../../settings/work/rule-reference.md), defined for the work item type. Scenarios where this is useful are migrations where you don't want to update the by/date fields on import, or when you want to skip the validation of a work item.  
   Rules can be bypassed in one of two ways. The first is through the [Work Items - update REST API](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work-items/update) and setting the `bypassRules` parameter to `true`. The second is through the client object model, by initializing in bypassrules mode (initialize `WorkItemStore` with `WorkItemStoreFlags.BypassRules`).

   :::column span="2":::
   <a id="create-tag-definition-permission"></a> Create tag definition  
   `Tagging, Create`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
   [Can add tags to a work item](../../../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md). By default, all members of the Contributors group have this permission. Also, you can set additional tagging permissions through security management tools. See [Security namespace and permission reference, Tagging](../namespace-reference.md).
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="4":::
   > [!NOTE]   
   > All users granted Stakeholder access can only add existing tags. Even if the **Create tag definition** permission is set to **Allow**, stakeholders can't add tags. This is part of the Stakeholder access settings. To learn more, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](/stakeholder-access.md).
   > Although the **Create tag definition**  permission appears
   > in the security settings at the project-level,
   > tagging permissions are actually collection level permissions that are scoped
   > at the project level when they appear in the user interface.
   > To scope tagging permissions to a single project when using the **TFSSecurity** command,
   > you must provide the GUID for the project as part of the command syntax.
   > Otherwise, your change will apply to the entire collection.
   > Keep this in mind when changing or setting these permissions.
