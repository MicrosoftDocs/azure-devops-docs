> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you regularly review the rules listed on the "Group rules" tab of the "Users" page. If there are any changes made to the Active Directory (AD) group membership, these changes will be reflected in the next re-evaluation of the group rules, which can be done on demand, when a group rule is modified, or automatically every 24 hours. Azure DevOps updates Azure AD group membership every hour, but it may take up to 24 hours for Azure AD to update dynamic group membership.
