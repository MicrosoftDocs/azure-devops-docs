# Stakeholder access quick reference


[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

**Stakeholder** access is available to support free access to a limited set of features by an unlimited set of stakeholders.  In general, **Stakeholder** access users gain limited access to Azure Boards, Azure Pipelines, and collaboration tools. They have no access to code repositories. 

**Stakeholder** access users  can create and modify work items and create and save queries. They can also view and approve release pipelines and perform administrative tasks when granted administrative permissions or added to an administrative group. If they need to contribute to the code base, then you must assign them **Basic** or higher-level access.  

If you've been assigned **Stakeholder** access and want to start using Azure Boards to track work, see [Get started as a Stakeholder](get-started-stakeholder.md). If you've been tasked to support administrative tasks, see [Manage your project](../../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md).
 

## Assign Stakeholder access users to a security group 

In general, use the following guidance when assigning **Stakeholder** access users to a security group: 

- Add to the **Contributors** security group managers or users who don't actively contribute to the code base but want to check project status and provide direction, feedback, feature ideas, and business alignment to a team. 
- Add to the **Project Administrators** security group users tasked with managing project resources. 
- Add to the **Project Collection Administrators** security group users tasked with managing organization or collection resources.

## Public versus private feature access

Users granted **Stakeholder** access are granted different access to features depending on whether it is a private or a public project. For private projects, Stakeholders have limited access to select work tracking functions, whereas for public projects, Stakeholders enjoy full access to work tracking features. To learn more about public projects, see [What is a public project?](../projects/about-projects.md).

## Work tracking

The following table summarizes the features Stakeholder access users have access to from Azure Boards. Stakeholders access users can view and edit all work items for which they have Area Path permissions, which by default is set to Allow for all user security groups. To learn more, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path).

For an overview of work tracking features, see [What is Azure Boards?](../../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md)

## Azure Pipelines 

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="azure-devops" 
The following table summarizes the features available to **Stakeholder** access users for Private and Public projects. When the **Free access to Pipelines for Stakeholders** preview feature is enabled for the organization, Stakeholders get access to all features listed under **Public project**.  Without this feature enabled, **Stakeholder** access users can only view and approve releases. To learn more, see [Provide Stakeholders access to edit build and release pipelines](provide-stakeholder-pipeline-access.md).

For an overview of pipelines features and functions, see [Continuous integration on any platform](../../pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines.md).
