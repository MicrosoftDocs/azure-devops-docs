# Restrict new user invitations from Project and Team Administrators 

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

By default, all administrators can invite new users to their Azure DevOps organization. Disabling this policy blocks Team and Project Administrators from inviting new users. Project Collection Administrators (PCAs) can add new users to the organization, regardless of the policy status. If a user is already a member of the organization, Project and Team Administrators can add that user to a project.

<!---

|  Role               |Policy **on** |Policy **off**  |
|----------------|---------|---------|
|Team Administrators|can add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization, can add users who are already in the organization to their team | **cannot** add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization, can add users who are already in the organization to their team        |
|Project Administrators| can add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization,

## Prerequisites

You must be a member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.

## Turn off policy

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

3. Under Security, select **Policies**, and then move the toggle to **off**.

Now, only Project Collection Administrators can invite new users to Azure DevOps.

> [!NOTE]
> **Known limitation:** Even with the policy turned off, Team and Project Administrators can re-invite users who were previously members of the organization.
