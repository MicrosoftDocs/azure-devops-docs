# Restrict administrators from inviting new users

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

By default, all administrators can invite new users to their Azure DevOps organization. Disabling this policy prevents Team and Project Administrators from inviting new users. However, Project Collection Administrators (PCAs) can still add new users to the organization regardless of the policy status. Additionally, if a user is already a member of the organization, Project and Team Administrators can add that user to specific projects.

|----------------|---------|---------|
|Team Administrators|can add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization, can add users who are already in the organization to their team | **cannot** add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization, can add users who are already in the organization to their team        |
|Project Administrators| can add new users to their team, which adds these users to the organization,

| **Permissions** | Member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group. |

## Turn off policy

Now, only Project Collection Administrators can invite new users to Azure DevOps.

> [!NOTE]
> Project and Team Administrators can directly add users to their projects through the permissions blade. However, if they attempt to add users through the **Add Users** button located in the **Organization settings** > **Users** section, it's not visible to them.
> Adding a user directly through **Project settings** > **Permissions** doesn't result in the user appearing automatically in the **Organization settings** > **Users** list. For the user to be reflected in the Users list, they must sign in to the system.
