# Change permissions at the organization or collection-level

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]


Several permissions are set at the organization or collection level. You can grant these permissions by adding a user or group to the **Project Collection Administrators** group. Or, you can grant select collection-level permissions to a custom security group or to a user. 
 
::: moniker range="azure-devops"
An organization is the container for several projects that share resources. For more information about projects and project collections, see [Plan your organizational structure](../../user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md).

## Collection-level permissions 

[!INCLUDE [collection-level-permissions](./includes/collection-level-permissions.md)]

## Prerequisites

- To manage permissions or groups at the organization or collection level, you must be a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** security group. If you created the organization or collection, you are automatically added as a member of this group. To get added to this group, you need to request permissions from a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group. See [Look up a project collection administrator](look-up-project-collection-administrators.md).
- If want to add security groups defined in Azure Active Directory or Active Directory, make sure those are first defined. To learn more, see [Add AD/Azure AD users or groups to a built-in security group](add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md).

> Users added to the **Project-Scoped Users** group can't access most **Organization Settings** pages, including **Permissions**. To learn more, see [Manage your organization, Limit  user visibility for projects and more](../../user-guide/manage-organization-collection.md#project-scoped-user-group).

## Add members to the Project Collection Administrators group 

You can add users who've been added to a project, organization, or collection to the **Project Collection Administrators** group, or any other group at the organization or collection level. To add a custom security group, first create the group as described in [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md).

Here we show how to add a user to the built-in **Project Collection Administrators** group. The method is similar to adding an Azure Active Directory or Active Directory group.

## Change permissions for a group 

You can change the project-level permissions for any project-level group. Each team added to a project is automatically added as a project-level group. To add security groups to a project, see [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md). To understand permission assignments and inheritance, see [About permissions, Permission states](about-permissions.md#permission-states).

## On-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, see these additional articles: 

- [Add a user as an Azure DevOps Server administrator](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator) 
- [Azure DevOps Server service account groups](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies)  

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites. See [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in TFS](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports).

## FAQs

#### Q: When do I need to add someone to the Project Collection Administrator role?

A: It varies. For most organizations that use Azure DevOps, Project Collection Administrators manage the collections that members of the **Team Foundation Administrators** group create. Members of the **Project Collection Administrators** group don't create the collections themselves. Project collection administrators also do many operations required to maintain the collection. Operations include creating team projects, adding users to groups, modifying the settings for the collection, and so on.

#### Q: What are the optimal permissions to administer a project collection across all of its components and dependencies?

A: Project collection administrators must be members of the following groups or have the following permissions:

- Team Foundation Server: A member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group, or have the appropriate [collection-level permissions](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#collection) set to **Allow**.

- SharePoint Products: If the collection is configured with a site collection resource, then a member of the **Site Collection Administrators** group.

- Reporting Services: If the collection is configured with reporting resources, then a member of the **Team Foundation Content Manager** group.

#### Q: I'm an admin, but I don't have permission to add a Project Collection Administrator. What do I need?

A: The following permissions are required:

- You must be a **Project Collection Administrator**, or your **View Server-Level Information** and **Edit Server-Level Information** permissions must be set to **Allow**.

- To add permissions for SharePoint Products, you must be a member of the **Site Collection Administrators** or **Farm Administrators** groups for SharePoint Products.

- To add permissions for Reporting Services, you must be a member of the **Content Managers** or **Team Foundation Content Managers** groups for Reporting Services.

> [!Important]
> To perform administrative tasks like creating project collections, your user requires administrative permissions. The service account that the Team Foundation Background Job Agent uses must have certain permissions granted to it. For more information, see [Service accounts and dependencies in Team Foundation Server](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies) and [Team Foundation Background Job Agent](/azure/devops/server/architecture/background-job-agent).
