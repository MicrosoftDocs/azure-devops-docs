# Change permissions at the organization or collection-level

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This article shows you how to manage permissions at the organization or collection level. Several permissions are set at these levels. You can only grant these permissions if you're a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group.
 
::: moniker range="azure-devops"
An organization is the container for several projects that share resources. For more information, see [Plan your organizational structure](../../user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md).

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
A project collection is the container for several projects that share resources. For more information, see [About projects and scaling your organization](../../organizations/projects/about-projects.md).

## Collection-level permissions 

[!INCLUDE [collection-level-permissions](./includes/collection-level-permissions.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> **Project Collection Administrators** can manage organization or collection-level security groups, group membership, and edit permission ACLs. This permission isn't controlled through the user interface.

## Prerequisites

|Category  | Requirements |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Permissions** | Member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). If you created the organization or collection, you're automatically a member of this group. |
| **Directory services** | [Security groups defined in Microsoft Entra ID or Active Directory](add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md) before adding them to Azure DevOps. |

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
> [!NOTE]   
>- Users in the **Project-scoped Users** group can't access most organization settings, including permissions. For more information, see [Manage your organization, limit user visibility for projects, and more](../../user-guide/manage-organization-collection.md#project-scoped-user-group).
>- Users with **Stakeholder** access can't access specific features even if they have permissions to those features. For more information, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](stakeholder-access.md).

## Add members to the Project Administrators group 

Do the following steps to add users to the **Project Administrators** group or any other group at the organization or collection level. To add a custom security group, first [create the group](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md).

## Change permissions for a group 

You can change the permissions for any organization or collection-level group, except the **Project Collection Administrators** group. Adding security groups to a collection is similar to adding them to a project. For more information, see [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md) and [About permissions, Permission states](about-permissions.md#permission-states).

## On-premises deployments

For on-premises deployments, see the following articles: 

- [Add a user as an Azure DevOps Server administrator](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator) 
- [Azure DevOps Server service account groups](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies)  

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

If your on-premises deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, manage membership for those products separately from their websites. For more information, see [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports).

## FAQs

#### Q: When do I need to add someone to the Project Collection Administrator role?

A: It varies. In most organizations, Project Collection Administrators manage the collections created by the **Team Foundation Administrators** group. They don’t create collections themselves but handle tasks like creating team projects, adding users to groups, and modifying collection settings.

#### Q: What are the optimal permissions to administer a project collection across all of its components and dependencies?

A: Project Collection Administrators need the following permissions:

- **Team Foundation Server:** Members of the **Project Collection Administrators** group, or have the necessary [collection-level permissions](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#collection) set to **Allow**.
- **SharePoint Products:** Members of the **Site Collection Administrators** group if the collection includes a site collection resource.
- **Reporting Services:** Members of the **Team Foundation Content Manager** group if the collection includes reporting resources.

#### Q: I'm an admin, but I don't have permission to add a Project Collection Administrator. What do I need?

A: You need the following permissions:
- **Project Collection Administrator** or **View Server-Level Information and Edit Server-Level Information** set to **Allow**.
- For SharePoint Products, membership in the **Site Collection Administrators or Farm Administrators** groups.
- For Reporting Services, membership in the **Content Managers** or **Team Foundation Content Managers** groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To create project collections and perform other administrative tasks, users need administrative permissions. Additionally, the service account for the Team Foundation Background Job Agent must have specific permissions. For more information, see [Service accounts and dependencies in Team Foundation Server](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies) and [Team Foundation Background Job Agent](/azure/devops/server/architecture/background-job-agent).
