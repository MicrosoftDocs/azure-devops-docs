# About access levels

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Access levels grant or restrict access to select web portal features. This is in addition to permissions granted through security groups, which provide or restrict specific tasks. Access levels enable administrators to provide their user base access to the features they need and only pay for those features. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/version-selector-minimize.md)] 

When you add a user or group to a team or project, they're automatically granted access to those features supported by the default access level and those supported by the security group to which they are added. Most users can access most features by being assigned to the **Basic** access level and **Contributors** security group. For a simplified overview of the permissions assigned to the most common groups **Readers**, **Contributors**, and **Project Administrators**, see [Default permissions](permissions-access.md).  

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
To add user accounts or groups to specific access levels, see [Manage users and access](../accounts/add-organization-users.md). Make sure to set each user's access level based on what you've purchased for that user.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"  
To add user accounts or groups to specific access levels, see [Change access levels](change-access-levels.md). Make sure to set each user's access level based on what you've purchased for that user. 
::: moniker-end  

## Supported access levels

Assign users or groups of users to one of the following access levels:

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

- **Basic**: Provides access to most features. Assign to users with a Visual Studio Professional subscription, an Azure DevOps Server CAL, and to users for whom you're paying for Basic access in an organization.
- **Basic + Test Plans**: Provides access to all features included in **Basic**, as well as Azure Test Plans. Assign to users with a Visual Studio Test Professional or MSDN Platforms subscription, and to users for whom you're paying for Basic + Test Plans access in an organization.
- **Stakeholder**: Can be assigned to unlimited users for free. Provides partial access to private projects and mostly full access to public projects. Assign to users with no license or subscriptions who need access to a limited set of features. For feature access details, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](stakeholder-access.md). 
- **Visual Studio Subscriber**: Assign to users who already have a Visual Studio subscription. The system automatically recognizes the user's subscription&mdash;Visual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Professional, Visual Studio Test Professional, or MSDN Platform&mdash;and enables any other features that are included in their subscription level. If you assign **Basic** or **Stakeholder**, they also receive their Visual Studio subscription benefits upon sign-in.

> [!TIP]
> As a best practice when adding new users, we recommend assigning the **Visual Studio Subscriber** level when appropriate (as opposed to Basic) to prevent being charged the **Basic** rate before the user signs in for the first time.

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops"

- **Stakeholder**: Provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free. Assign to users with no license or subscriptions who need access to a limited set of features.
- **Basic**: Provides access to most features. Assign  to users with an Azure DevOps Server CAL, with a Visual Studio Professional subscription, and to users for whom you're paying for Basic access in an organization.
- **Basic + Test Plans**: Provides access for users who have a monthly Test Manager subscription, Visual Studio Test Professional, or MSDN Platforms subscription. 
- **VS Enterprise**: Provides access to premium features. Assign to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise.

::: moniker-end  

 

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

- **Stakeholder**: Provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free. Assign to users with no license or subscriptions who need access to a limited set of features.
- **Basic**: Provides access to most features. Assign to users with a CAL or with a Visual Studio Professional subscription. 
- **Advanced** (legacy access level, deprecated in Azure DevOps Server 2019): Provides access to premium features. Only assign to users with a subscription to MSDN Platforms or Visual Studio Test Professional.
- **VS Enterprise**: Provides access to premium features. Assign to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise.

::: moniker-end    

The following table indicates those features available for each supported access level. Visual Studio Test Professional and MSDN Platform subscriptions grant access to the same features as Visual Studio Enterprise.

## Visual Studio subscription access

Visual Studio subscribers are entitled to **Visual Studio subscription** features as a subscriber benefit. When you add those users, be sure to assign them the **Visual Studio subscription** access level. 

The system automatically recognizes their subscription and enables any other features that are included, based on their subscription level.

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

## VS Enterprise access

Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers are entitled to **VS Enterprise** access as a subscriber benefit. When you add those users, be sure to assign them the **VS Enterprise** access level. 

With VS Enterprise access, users have access to any fee-based, Marketplace extension published by Microsoft Marketplace extension published by Microsoft that is included for active Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers. 

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"

## Advanced access

Users assigned Advanced access can manage test cases when you have [purchased the Test Manager extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web) for Azure Test Plans and assigned to the user accounts to gain full access to [Web-based test case management tools](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

Users assigned Advanced access have all the Basic features, plus [web-based test case management tools](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md). You can [buy monthly access](../billing/buy-access-tfs-test-hub.md#buy-users-monthly-access-to-azure-test-plans) or add users who already have a Visual Studio Test Professional with MSDN or MSDN Platforms subscription.

## Programmatic mapping of access levels


::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can manage access levels programmatically using the [`az devops user add` (Azure DevOps Services only)](../accounts/add-organization-users.md) or the [User Entitlement - Add REST API](/rest/api/azure/devops/memberentitlementmanagement/user-entitlements/add). The following table provides a mapping of the access level selected through the user interface and the `AccountLicenseType`, `licensingSource`, and `msdnLicenseType` parameters.

| Access level (user interface)<br/>licenseDisplayName  | accountLicenseType | licensingSource | msdnLicenseType |

You can manage access levels programmatically using the [User Entitlement - Add REST API](/rest/api/azure/devops/memberentitlementmanagement/user-entitlements/add). The following table provides a mapping of the access level selected through the user interface and the `AccountLicenseType`, `licensingSource`, and `msdnLicenseType` parameters.

| Access level (user interface)<br/>licenseDisplayName  | accountLicenseType | licensingSource | msdnLicenseType | 
| ------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Basic                                                 | express            | account        | none             | 
| Advanced                                              | advanced           | account        | none             | 
| Stakeholder                                           | stakeholder        | account        | none             | 
| VS Enterprise                                         | none               | msdn           | enterprise       |

## What features are available to users who are added to two different access levels?

If a user belongs to a group that has **Basic** access and another group that has **VS Enterprise** access, the user has access to all features available through **VS Enterprise**, which is a superset of **Basic**.

## Service account access

Azure DevOps Server [service accounts](/azure/devops/server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies) are added to the default access level. If you make Stakeholder the default access level, you must add the service accounts to Basic or Advanced/VS Enterprise access.  

Service accounts don't require a CAL or other purchase.
