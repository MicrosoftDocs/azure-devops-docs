# About access levels

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Access levels enable administrators the ability to provide their user base access to the features they need and only pay for those features. To connect and use the functions and features that Azure DevOps provides, users must be added to a group with the appropriate permissions. To use select web portal features, they must also belong to the access level that enables access to that feature.

Make sure to set each user's access level based on what you've purchased for that user. Basic access includes all Stakeholder features. Advanced and Visual Studio Enterprise subscriber access levels include all Basic features. 

::: moniker range="vsts"
To add user accounts or groups to specific access levels, see [Manage users and access](../accounts/add-organization-users.md).
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azdevserver-2019"
To add user accounts or groups to specific access levels, see [Change access levels](change-access-levels.md). 
::: moniker-end


When you add a user or group to a team or project, they're automatically granted access to those features supported by the default access level, which is Basic. This provides most users all the features they need. For a simplified overview of the permissions assigned to the most common groups&#151;Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators&#151;as well as the Stakeholder access group, see [Permissions and access](permissions-access.md).  

You assign users or groups of users to one of the following access levels:

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"
- **Basic**: provides access to most features  
- **VS Enterprise**: provides access to premium features
- **Stakeholders**: provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"
- **Basic**: provides access to most features  
- **VS Enterprise** (TFS 2017.1 and later versions): provides access to premium features
- **Advanced** (TFS 2017 and earlier versions): provides access to premium features 
- **Stakeholders**: provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015"
- **Basic**: provides access to most features  
- **Advanced** : provides access to premium features 
- **Stakeholders**: provides partial access, can be assigned to unlimited users for free
::: moniker-end

Assign **Basic** to users with a TFS CAL, with a Visual Studio Professional subscription, and to users for whom you are paying for Azure Boards & Repos in an organization. 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

Assign **VS Enterprise** to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise.This enables the Test Manager feature.
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="tfs-2017"
Assign **Advanced** (TFS 2017) to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Test Professional or MSDN Platforms. Assign **VS Enterprise** (TFS 2017.1 and later versions) to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise. This enables the Test Manager feature.  
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2015"
Assign **Advanced** to users with a subscription to Visual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Test Professional or MSDN Platforms.
::: moniker-end


Assign **Stakeholders** to users with no license or subscriptions who need access to a limited set of features.

See [what benefits come with each subscription level](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-azure-devops).


## Basic, Azure Boards & Repos

Assign **Basic**  to users in your organization who need to manage backlogs or sprints, or who need access to Git or TFVC code repos. You get 5 free users with your organization, and then pay per user per month for additional users.

::: moniker range="<= azdevserver-2019"
![Basic access features](_img/access-levels-2017-basic.png)
::: moniker-end

Basic access allows users to access **Code**, **Build**, and **Test**  in addition to **Dashboards/Home** and **Work**.
- [Basic & Advanced backlog and sprint planning tools](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md)  
- [Request and manage feedback](../../project/feedback/get-feedback.md)<sup> 1</sup>  
- [Chart viewing & Chart authoring](../../report/charts.md)  
- **Code**: [Git](../../repos/git/overview.md) and [TFVC](../../repos/tfvc/overview.md)  
- [Build](../../pipelines/overview.md)  
- [Administer account](#administer-account)<sup> 2</sup>
- [Advanced home page](../../project/wiki/project-vision-status.md)<sup> 3</sup>
- [Author release pipelines](../../pipelines/release/index.md)<sup> 4</sup>
- [Advanced portfolio management](../../boards/backlogs/define-features-epics.md) 
- [Team rooms](../../notifications/collaborate-in-a-team-room.md)<sup> 5</sup>
- [Analyze test results and manage machine groups](../../test/test-different-configurations.md) 

**Notes:**

1. Requires TFS 2015.1 or later version.
2. You can open Team settings, Project settings, and Collection level settings to view and modify settings provided you are a team, project, or project collection administrator. See [Administer account features](#administer-account).
3. Advanced home page allows you to configure and view the Project summary page in addition to team dashboards.  
4. Requires TFS 2015.2 or later version.    
5. Requires TFS 2017 or earlier versions. Deprecated for TFS 2018 and later versions.

Within the admin context, there are several pages which support administrating features at the team, project, project collection/organization level. To learn more, see [About user, team, project, and organization-level settings](../settings/about-settings.md).

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"
## VS Enterprise

Visual Studio subscribers are entitled to **Basic** features (Azure Boards & Repos) as a subscriber benefit, so when you add those users be sure to assign them **VS Enterprise** access level and the system will automatically recognize their subscription and enable any other features that are included based on their subscription level. For instance, the Test Plans feature is included for Visual Studio Enterprise, MSDN Platforms, and Visual Studio Test Professional subscribers.

With VS Enterprise access, users have access to any fee-based, Marketplace extension published by Microsoft Marketplace extension published by Microsoft that is included for active Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers. Examples include [Azure Artifacts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed) (which is also free for 5 users who are not Visual Studio Enterprise subscribers) and [Test Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web). 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= azdevserver-2019"
For TFS 2017.2 and later versions, assign **VS Enterprise** to those users for whom you've purchased Visual Studio Enterprise. These include a TFS CAL plus the rights to access VS Enterprise features. (For users with MSDN Platforms subscriptions or Test Professional, assign the Basic access level and the Test Manager extension.) To learn more, see [Assign paid extension access to users](../../marketplace/how-to/assign-paid-extension-access.md). For example, for users with Visual Studio Test Professional or Visual Studio Enterprise, assign them [access to the Test Manager extension](../../marketplace/how-to/assign-paid-extension-access.md).

<!--- **TFS 2017.2** -->

<img src="_img/access-levels-2017-vs.png" alt="VS Enterprise access features" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2017"
## Advanced 
Users assigned Advanced access can manage test cases when you have [purchased Test Manager extensions and assigned to the user accounts](access-levels.md#test-manager) to gain full access to [Web-based test case management tools](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).

For TFS 2017 and earlier versions, you should assign the **Advanced** level to those users for whom you've purchased the full Test feature set. Here are the purchasing options:  
- Higher-level Visual Studio subscriptions: Visual Studio Test Professional, Visual Studio Enterprise, or MSDN Platforms subscriptions.
These include a TFS CAL plus the rights to access the full set of Test features.  
- A paid Azure DevOps user (which includes a TFS CAL) plus the [Test Manager extension](#test-manager). 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"
For TFS 2017.2, Assign **Advanced** access to those users for whom you've purchased MSDN Platforms or Visual Studio Test Professional subscriptions. These include a TFS CAL plus the rights to access Test Manager. To learn more, see [Get extensions for TFS, Assign paid extension access to users](../../marketplace/how-to/assign-paid-extension-access.md).
	

**TFS 2017.2**

![TFS 2017.2, Advanced Access](_img/access-levels-2017-update2-vs-t.png)

**TFS 2017.1**

> [!NOTE]   
> With TFS 2017.1, the Advanced access level was temporarily disabled. Updating to TFS 2017.2 will re-enable it. If you are on TFS 2017.1 and have users with Visual Studio Test Professional or MSDN Platforms subscriptions, you should assign them Basic access level. In addition, you need to open **Users** for the project collections in which they are a member and [assign them the Test Manager extension](../../marketplace/assign-paid-extensions.md). To learn more, see [Buy access to TFS or TFS Test](../../billing/buy-access-tfs-test-hub.md).

### Stakeholder access to administrative features

The following administrative features are granted or denied to users with Stakeholder access by default. Additional features are granted to Stakeholders in public projects. 

Items with a ![ ](_img/icons/checkmark.png) checkmark are granted permission by default. Items with an ![red x](_img/icons/delete-icon.png) indicate that permissions aren't granted and can't be granted to Stakeholders. Members of the Project Collection Administrators or Project Administrators group can grant or deny these permissions for Stakeholders. 

**Project settings**
| Permission | Private project | Public project|
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
|Bypass rules on work item updates | ![yes](_img/icons/checkmark.png)| ![yes](_img/icons/checkmark.png) |
|Change process of project | ![yes](_img/icons/checkmark.png)| ![yes](_img/icons/checkmark.png) |

1. Stakeholders can assign existing tags to work items, but not create new tags.  
2. Stakeholders cannot change the backlog priority order (all items are added at the end of the backlog), assign items to an iteration using drag and drop, use the mapping pane or forecasting.
3. Stakeholders cannot move cards on the board to update status, set the values of fields shown on cards, or set or view  team capacity.
4. Stakeholders can save queries under My Queries but cannot save under Shared Queries.
5. Stakeholders can only view and approve releases.

## What features can users access who are added to two different groups?
If a user belongs to a group that has **Basic** access and another group that has **VS Enterprise** access, the user has access to all features available through **VS Enterprise**, which is a superset of **Basic**.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= azdevserver-2019"

## Azure DevOps Server and TFS Service account access  
[TFS service accounts](/tfs/tfs-server/admin/service-accounts-dependencies-tfs) are added to the default access level. If you make Stakeholder the default access level, you must set the TFS service accounts to Basic or Advanced/VS Enterprise access.  

Service accounts don't require a TFS CAL or other purchase.
