# Default Git repository and branch permissions

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

After you've been added as a team member, you are a member of the Contributors group. This membership allows you to contribute to a Git repository. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. These groups are assigned the default permissions for contributing to a branch or repository.

From the project admin content, on the **Version Control** page, you can [set permissions on a repository](set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md). 

From the **Code** > **Branches** page, you can [set permissions for a specific branch and set branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-permissions.md). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/code-git.md)]
