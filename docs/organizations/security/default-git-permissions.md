# Default Git repository and branch permissions

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../includes/version-all.md)]

After you've been added as a team member, you are a member of the Contributors group. This membership allows you to contribute to a Git repository. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. These groups are assigned default permissions for contributing to a branch or repository.

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/code-git.md)]

To change permissions or set policies for Git repositories or branches, see the following articles: 

- [Git repository settings and policies](../../repos/git/repository-settings.md)
- [Set Git repository permissions](../../repos/git/set-git-repository-permissions.md). 
- [Set permissions for a specific branch and set branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-permissions.md). 
 
[!INCLUDE [tip-search-settings](../../includes/tip-find-setting-permission.md)]
