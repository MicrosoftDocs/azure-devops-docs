# Default permissions and access for Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../includes/version-all.md)]

To use  Azure DevOps features, users must be added to a security group with the appropriate permissions and granted access to the web portal. Limitations to select features are based on the *access level* and *security group* to which a user is assigned. The **Basic** access level and higher supports full access to all Azure Boards features. **Stakeholder** access level provides partial support to select features, allowing users to view and modify work items, but not use all features. **Stakeholder** access is available to support free access to a limited set of features by an unlimited set of stakeholders. 

The most common built-in security groups&mdash;**Readers**, **Contributors**, and **Project Administrators**&mdash; and team administrator role grant permissions to specific features. 

In general, use the following guidance when assigning users to an access level and security group: 
- Grant **Basic** access or higher and add to the **Contributors** security group full-time workers who contribute to the code base or manage projects.
- Grant **Stakeholder** access and add to the **Contributors** security group managers or users who don't actively contribute to the code base but want to check project status and provide direction, feedback, feature ideas, and business alignment to a team. 
- Grant **Stakeholder** access and add to the **Project Administrators** security group users tasked with managing project resources. If they also need to contribute to the code base, then you must assign them **Basic** or higher-level access.  
- Grant **Stakeholder** access and add to the **Project Collection Administrators** security group users tasked with managing organization or collection resources. If they also need to contribute to the code base, then you must assign them **Basic** or higher-level access.  

To learn more about administrative tasks see [About user, team, project, and organization-level settings](../settings/about-settings.md).  For a complete reference of all built-in groups and permissions, see [Permissions and groups](permissions.md). For information about access levels, see [About access levels](access-levels.md). 

In the tables provided in this article, a ✔️ indicates that the corresponding access level or security group has access to a feature by default. 


For a comparison chart of Stakeholder versus Basic access, see the [Feature matrix](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/compare-features/). To assign or change an access level, see [Add users and assign licenses](../accounts/add-organization-users.md). If you need to [grant specific users select permissions](change-individual-permissions.md), you can do so.

## Azure Boards

You can plan and track work from the web portal **Boards** hub, and using Eclipse, Visual Studio, Excel, Project, and other clients. For an overview of work tracking features, see [About Agile tools](../../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md). To change permissions, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Users granted Stakeholder access are granted different access to features depending on whether it is a private or a public project. For private projects, Stakeholders have limited access to select work tracking functions, whereas for public projects, Stakeholders enjoy full access to work tracking features. To learn more, see [About access levels, Stakeholder access](access-levels.md#stakeholder-access).

## Work tracking

You can plan and track work from the web portal **Work** hub, and using Eclipse, Visual Studio, Excel, Project, and other clients. For an overview of work tracking features, see [About Agile tools](../../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md). 

::: moniker-end

> [!NOTE]   
> Team administrators can configure settings for their team's tools. Organization owners and members of the Project Administrators group can configure settings for all teams. To be added as an administrator, see [Add team administrators](../settings/add-team-administrator.md) or [Add administrators, set permissions at the project-level or project collection-level](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). 

Access to the following tasks are controlled by each user's access level or by permission assignments. Members of the Readers, Contributors, or Project Administrators group are assumed to have Basic access or greater.  

### General work item feature access

You can use work items to track anything you need to track. To learn more, see [Understand how work items are used to track issues, tasks, and epics](../../boards/work-items/about-work-items.md).   

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/boards-work-items.md)]

### Boards feature access

You use [**Boards**](../../boards/boards/kanban-quickstart.md) to implement Kanban methods. Boards present work items as cards and support quick status updates through drag-and-drop.

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/boards-boards.md)]

### Backlogs features access

[**Backlogs**](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md) display work items as lists. A product backlog represents your project plan and a repository of all the information you need to track and share with your team. Portfolio backlogs allow you to group and organize your backlog into a hierarchy.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/boards-backlogs.md)]


### Sprints feature access

You use sprint tools to implement Scrum methods. The [**Sprints**](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) set of tools provide filtered views of work items that a team has assigned to specific iteration paths or sprints. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/boards-sprints.md)]

### Queries and semantic search 

[**Queries**](../../boards/queries/view-run-query.md) are filtered lists of work items based on criteria that you define by using a query editor. [Adhoc searches](../../boards/queries/search-box-queries.md) are powered by a semantic search engine.

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/boards-queries.md)]


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"

### Delivery plans feature access

[Delivery plans](../../boards/plans/review-team-plans.md) display work items as cards against a calendar view. This format can be an effective communication tool with managers, partners, and stakeholders for a team.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/boards-plans.md)]

::: moniker-end

### Additional permissions 

In addition to the permissions set at the [project level via the built-in groups](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md), you can set permissions for the following objects: [area and iteration paths](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) and individual [queries and query folders](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md).  


<!---
::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"  
> [!NOTE]  
> There are no UI permissions associated with [managing tags](../../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md). Instead, you can manage them using the [TFSSecurity command line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#collection-level-permissions).
