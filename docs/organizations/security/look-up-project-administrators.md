# Look up a project administrator 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

The **Project Administrators** group is the main administrative security group defined for a project. Members of the **Project Administrators** group have permissions to perform the following common tasks:  

- Delete and rename the project  
- Add users and teams to the project
- Add and manage **Area Paths** and **Iteration Paths** 
- Add and manage shared query folders  
- Add members and groups to the **Project Administrators** group or any other project-level group
- Manage permissions at the project-level or for any object defined for the project.  

To add members to the **Project Administrators** group or change a project-level permission see [Change project-level permissions](change-project-level-permissions.md). 

For a description of each project-level group, see [Security groups, service accounts, and permissions, Project-level groups](permissions.md#project-level-groups). To understand how security groups are used to manage permissions, see [Get started with permissions, access, and security groups](about-permissions.md).
