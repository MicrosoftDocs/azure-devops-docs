# Security groups, service accounts, and permissions in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

   This article provides a comprehensive reference for each built-in user, group, and permission. It's a lot of information describing each built-in security user and group as well as each permission. 

   For a quick reference to default assignments, see [Default permissions and access](permissions-access.md). For an overview of how permissions and security are managed, see [Get started with permissions, access, and security groups](about-permissions.md). In addition to security groups, there are also [security roles](about-security-roles.md), which provide permissions for select areas. 

   To learn how to add users to a group or set a specific permission that you can manage through the web portal, see the following resources:

   <a name="service-accounts"></a>

## Service accounts

   There are a few service accounts that are generated by the system to support specific operations. These include those described in the following table. These user accounts are added at the organization or collection level. 

| User name | Description |  
| ----------| ----------- |  
| Agent Pool Service | Has permission to listen to the message queue for the specific pool to receive work. In most cases, you should not have to manage members of this group. The agent registration process takes care of it for you. The service account you specify for the agent (commonly Network Service) is automatically added when you register the agent. Responsible for performing Azure Boards read/write operations and updating work items when GitHub objects are updated.   |  
| Azure Boards | Added when Azure Boards is [connected to GitHub](../../boards/github/connect-to-github.md). You should not have to manage members of this group. Responsible for managing the link creation between GitHub and Azure Boards. |  
| PipelinesSDK | Added as needed to support the Pipelines policy service scope tokens. This user account is similar to the build service identities but supports locking down permissions separately. In practice, the tokens that involve this identity are granted read-only permissions to pipeline resources and the one-time ability to approve policy requests. This account should be treated in the same way that the build service identities are treated.   |  
| *ProjectName* Build Service | Has permissions to run build services for the project. This is a legacy user used for XAML builds. It is added to the Security Service Group, which is used to store users who have been granted permissions, but not added to any other security group.  |  
| Project Collection Build Service | Has permissions to run build services for the collection. It is added to the Security Service Group, which is used to store users who have been granted permissions, but not added to any other security group.  |  

   <a name="groups"></a>

## Groups

   Permissions can be granted directly to an individual, or to a group.
   Using groups makes things a lot simpler. 
   The system provides several built-in groups for that purpose.
   These groups and the default permissions they're assigned are defined at different levels:
   server (on-premises deployment only), project collection, project, and specific objects.
   You can also create your own groups and grant them the specific set of permissions
   that are appropriate for certain roles in your organization.

## Server-level groups 

When you install Azure DevOps Server, the system creates default groups that have [deployment-wide, server-level permissions](#server-permissions). You cannot remove or delete the built-in server-level groups.

## Collection-level groups

   When you create an organization or project collection in Azure DevOps, the system creates collection-level groups that have [permissions in that collection](#collection-level). You cannot remove or delete the built-in collection-level groups.

   <!---
   Project Collection Administrators
   Project Collection Build Administrators
   Project Collection Build Service Accounts
   Project Collection Proxy Service Accounts
   Project Collection Service Accounts
   Project Collection Test Service Accounts
   Project Collection Valid Users

The full name of each of these groups is **[{collection name}]\\{group name}**. 
So the full name of the administrator group for the default collection is 
**[Default Collection]\\Project Collection Administrators**.

## Team administrator role

For each team that you add, you can assign one or more team members as administrators. The team admin role isn't a group with a set of defined permissions. Instead, the team admin role is tasked with managing  team assets. To learn more, see [Manage teams and configure team tools](../settings/manage-teams.md). To add a user as a team administrator, see [Add a team administrator](../settings/add-team-administrator.md).

> [!NOTE]   
> Project Administrators can manage all team administrative areas for all teams. 

## Permissions

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
The system manages permissions at different levels&mdash;organization, project, object as well as role-based permissions&mdash;and by default assigns them to one or more built-in groups. You can manage most permissions through the web portal. Additional permissions can be managed using one or more [security management tools](security-tools-reference.md) by specifying a namespace permission.

In the following sections, the namespace permission is provided following the permission label that displays in the user interface. For example:   
   **Create tag definition**  
   `Tagging, Create`

## Server-level permissions 

   You manage server-level permissions through the [Team Foundation Administration Console](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator) or [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#permissions). Team Foundation Administrators are granted all server-level permissions. Other server-level groups have select permission assignments.

## Pipeline or Build (object-level)

You manage pipeline permissions [for each pipeline defined in the web portal](../../pipelines/policies/set-permissions.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#build-permissions). Project Administrators are granted all pipeline permissions and Build Administrators are assigned most of these permissions. You can set pipeline permissions for all pipelines defined for a project or for each pipeline definition.

   Permissions in Build follow a hierarchical model. Defaults for all the permissions can be set at the project level and can be overridden on an individual build definition.

   To set the permissions at project level for all build definitions in a project, choose **Security** from the action bar on the main page of Builds hub.

   To set or override the permissions for a specific build definition, choose **Security** from the context menu of the build definition.

   The following permissions are defined in Build. All of these can be set at both the levels.

   Area path permissions grant or restrict access to branches of the area hierarchy
   and to the work items in those areas.
   You manage the security of each area path from the [web portal](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#area). Area permissions grant or restrict access to create and manage area paths as well as create and modify work items defined under area paths.

   Members of the Project Administrators group are automatically granted permissions to manage area paths for a project. Consider granting team administrators or team leads permissions to create, edit, or delete area nodes.

> [!NOTE]  
> Multiple teams may contribute to a project.
> When that's the case, you can set up teams that are associated with an area.
> Permissions for the team's work items are assigned by assigning permissions to the area.
> There are other [team settings](../settings/manage-teams.md)
> that configure the team's agile planning tools.

## Release (object-level) 

   You manage permissions [for each release defined in the web portal](../../pipelines/policies/set-permissions.md). Project Administrators and Release Administrators are granted all release management permissions. These permissions can be granted or denied in a hierarchical model at the project level, for a specific release pipeline, or for a specific environment in a release pipeline. Within this hierarchy, permissions can be inherited from the parent or overridden.


:::image type="content" source="media/permissions/release-object-level-permissions.png" alt-text="Releases object-level permissions.":::

> [!NOTE]   
> The project-level Release Administrator's group is created at the same time the first release pipeline is defined. 

   In addition, you can assign approvers to specific steps within a release pipeline to ensure that the applications being deployed meet quality standards.

   The following permissions are defined in Release Management. The scope column explains whether the permission can be set at the project, release pipeline, or environment level.

   Default values for all of these permissions are set for team
   project collections and project groups. For example,
**Project Collection Administrators**, **Project Administrators**, and
**Release Administrators** are given all of the above permissions by

**Administer release permissions**. **Readers**, by default,
   are denied all permissions except **View release pipeline** and
**View releases**.

## Task group (Build and Release) permissions

   You manage permissions [for task groups from the **Build and Release** hub](../../pipelines/policies/set-permissions.md) of the web portal. Project, Build, and Release Administrators are granted all permissions. Task group permissions follow a hierarchical model. Defaults for all the permissions can be set at the project
   level and can be overridden on an individual task group definition.

   You use task groups to encapsulate a sequence of tasks already defined in a build or a release definition into a single reusable task. You [define and manage task groups](../../pipelines/library/task-groups.md) in the **Task groups** tab of the **Build and Release** hub.
