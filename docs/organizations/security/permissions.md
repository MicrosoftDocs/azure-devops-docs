# Permissions and groups in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

This article provides a comprehensive reference for each built-in group and permission. It's a lot of information describing each built-in security group as well as each permission. 

For a quick reference to default assignments, see [Default permissions and access](permissions-access.md). For an overview of how permissions and security are managed, see [About permissions and groups](about-permissions.md). In addition to security groups, there are also [security roles](about-security-roles.md) which provide permissions for select areas. 

To learn how to add users to a group or set a specific permission that you can manage through the web portal, see the following resources:

> The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this topic. These differences result from updates made to Azure DevOps. However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned. 



<a name="groups"></a>

## Groups

Permissions can be granted directly to an individual, or to a group.
Using groups can make things a lot simpler. 
The system provides several built-in groups for that purpose.
These groups and the default permissions they're assigned are defined at different levels:
server (on-premises deployment only), project collection, project, and specific objects.
You can also create your own groups and grant them the specific set of permissions
that are appropriate for certain roles in your organization.

<!---
Team Foundation Administrators
Team Foundation Proxy Service Accounts
Team Foundation Service Accounts
Team Foundation Valid Users
Project Server Integration Service Accounts
SharePoint Web Application Services

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"

## Server-level groups 

When you install Azure DevOps Server or TFS, the system creates default groups that have [deployment-wide, server-level permissions](#server-permissions). You can neither remove nor delete the built-in server-level groups.

![ADMIN_GROUPS_PERMISSIONS](_img/permissions/server-groups-and-permissions.png)


You can't remove or delete the default server level groups.

## Team administrator role

For each team that you add, you can assign one or more team members as administrators. The team admin role isn't a group with a set of defined permissions. Instead, the team admin role is tasked with managing  team assets. To learn more, see [Manage teams and configure team tools](../settings/manage-teams.md). To add a user as a team administrator, see [Add a team administrator](../settings/add-team-administrator.md).

> [!NOTE]   
> Project Administrators can manage all team administrative areas for all teams. 

## Permissions


The system manages permissions at different levels&mdash;server, collection, project, or object&mdash;and by default assigns them to one or more built-in groups. You manage most permissions through the web portal.

<a id="server">  </a>
<a id="server-permissions">  </a>

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

## Server-level permissions 

You manage server-level permissions through the [Team Foundation Administration Console](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator-tfs) or [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#permissions). Team Foundation Administrators are granted all server-level permissions. Other server-level groups have select permission assignments.

## Collection-level permissions

You manage collection-level permissions through the [web portal admin context](../../project/navigation/go-to-service-page.md#collection-admin-context) or [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#collection-level-permissions). Project Collection Administrators are granted all collection-level permissions. Other collection-level groups have select permission assignments.

## Project-level permissions

You manage project-level permissions from the [web portal admin context](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#team-project-level-permissions). Project Administrators are assigned all project-level permissions. Other project-level groups are assigned a subset of these permissions.

                    Although the <strong>Create tag definition</strong> permission appears

                    tagging permissions are actually collection level permissions that are scoped
                    at the project level when they appear in the user interface.
                    To scope tagging permissions to a single project when using the TFSSecurity command,
                    you must provide the GUID for the project as part of the command syntax.
                    Otherwise, your change will apply to the entire collection.

## Analytics views (object-level)     

With shared Analytics views, you can grant specific permissions to view, edit, or delete a view that you create.  You manage the security of Analytics views from the [web portal](../../report/powerbi/analytics-security.md). 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Manage permissions](../../report/powerbi/_img/editable-views/view-permissions.png)  

The following permissions are defined for each shared Analytics view. All valid users are automatically granted all permissions to manage Analytics views. Consider granting select permissions to specific shared views to other team members or security group that you create. See also, [What are Analytics views](../../report/powerbi/what-are-analytics-views.md)?

## Build (object-level)

You manage build permissions [for each build defined in the web portal](../../pipelines/policies/set-permissions.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#build-permissions). Project Administrators are granted all build permissions and Build Administrators are assigned most of these permissions. You can set build permissions for all build definitions or for each build definition.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Build object-level permissions dialog](_img/permissions/build-permissions-vsts.png)


Permissions in Build follow a hierarchical model. Defaults for all the permissions can be set at the project level and can be overridden on an individual build definition.

To set the permissions at project level for all build definitions in a project, choose **Security** from the action bar on the main page of Builds hub.

To set or override the permissions for a specific build definition, choose **Security** from the context menu of the build definition.

The following permissions are defined in Build. All of these can be set at both the levels.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    You turn Inheritance Off for a build definition
                    when you want to control permissions for specific build definitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When inheritance is On, the build definition respects the build permissions
                    defined at the project level or a group or user.
                    For example, a custom Build Managers group has permissions set to manually queue a build for project Fabrikam.
                    Any build definition with inheritance On for project Fabrikam would allow a member of the Build Managers group
                    the ability to manually queue a build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, by turning Inheritance Off for project Fabrikam,
                    you can set permissions that only allow Project Administrators
                    to manually queue a build for a specific build definition.
                    This would then allow me to set permissions for that build definition specifically.

Set permissions across all Git repositories by making changes to the top-level **Git repositories** entry.  

Individual repositories inherit permissions from  the top-level **Git Repositories** entry. Branches inherit permissions from assignments made at the repository level.   

By default, the project level Readers groups have only Read permissions.

You manage the security of each TFVC branch from the [web portal](set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#tfvc-permissions). Project Administrators are granted most of these permissions which appear only for a project that's been configured to use Team Foundation Version Control as a source control system. In version control permissions, explicit deny takes precedence over administrator group permissions.

## Area path (object-level)     

Area path permissions grant or restrict access to branches of the area hierarchy
and to the work items in those areas.
You manage the security of each area path from the [web portal](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#area). Area permissions grant or restrict access to create and manage area paths as well as create and modify work items defined under area paths.

Members of the Project Administrators group are automatically granted permissions to manage area paths for a project. Consider granting team administrators or team leads permissions to create, edit, or delete area nodes.

> [!NOTE]  
> Multiple teams may contribute to a project.
> When that's the case, you can set up teams that are associated with an area.
> Permissions for the team's work items are assigned by assigning permissions to the area.
> There are other [team settings](../settings/manage-teams.md)
> that configure the team's agile planning tools.

                    Although the <strong>Create tag definition</strong> permission appears
                    in the security settings at the project-level,
                    tagging permissions are actually collection level permissions that are scoped
                    at the project level when they appear in the user interface.
                    To scope tagging permissions to a single project when using the TFSSecurity command,
                    you must provide the GUID for the project as part of the command syntax.
                    Otherwise, your change will apply to the entire collection.
                    Keep this in mind when changing or setting these permissions.

## Release (object-level) 

If you are working with the Release Management client and server supported for TFS 2015, see [Automate deployments with Release Management](../../release/previous-version/release-management-overview.md).

## Release (object-level) 

You manage permissions [for each release defined in the web portal](../../pipelines/policies/set-permissions.md). Project Administrators and Release Administrators are granted all release management permissions. These permissions can be granted or denied in a hierarchical model at the project level, for a specific release pipeline, or for a specific environment in a release pipeline. Within this hierarchy, permissions can be inherited from the parent or overridden.

> [!NOTE]   
> The project-level Release Administrator's group is created at the same time the first release pipeline is defined. 

In addition, you can assign approvers to specific steps within a release pipeline to ensure that the applications being deployed meet quality standards.

The following permissions are defined in Release Management. The scope column explains whether the permission can be set at the project, release pipeline, or environment level.

Default values for all of these permissions are set for team
project collections and project groups. For example,
**Project Collection Administrators**, **Project Administrators**, and
**Release Administrators** are given all of the above permissions by
default. **Contributors** are given all permissions except
**Administer release permissions**. **Readers**, by default,
are denied all permissions except **View release pipeline** and
**View releases**.

## Task group (Build and Release) permissions

You manage permissions [for task groups from the **Build and Release** hub](../../pipelines/policies/set-permissions.md#task-group) of the web portal. Project, Build, and Release Administrators are granted all permissions. Task group permissions follow a hierarchical model. Defaults for all the permissions can be set at the project
level and can be overridden on an individual task group definition.

You use task groups to encapsulate a sequence of tasks already defined in a build or a release definition into a single reusable task. You [define and manage task groups](../../pipelines/library/task-groups.md) in the **Task groups** tab of the **Build and Release** hub.

> [!div class="tdCol2BreakAll"]  
> | Permission | Description | 
> |------------|-------------| 
> | **Administer task group permissions** | Can add and remove users or groups to task group security. |
> | **Delete task group** | Can delete a task group. | 
> | **Edit task group** | Can create, modify, or delete a task group. |

<a id="lab">  </a>

## Lab Management 

Visual Studio Lab Management permissions are specific to virtual machines, environments, and other resources. In addition, the creator of an object in Lab Management is automatically granted all permissions on that object.
You can set these permissions by using the [TFSLabConfig permissions command-line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfslabconfig-cmd#permissions).

By default, the project Readers groups have only View lab resources (Read) permissions.

> [!NOTE]  
> Lab Management is deprecated for TFS 2017. We recommend that you [use Build and Release Management instead of Lab Management for automated testing](/visualstudio/test/lab-management/use-build-or-rm-instead-of-lab-management).

## Notifications or alerts

There are no UI permissions associated with [managing email notifications or alerts](../../boards/queries/alerts-and-notifications.md). Instead, they can be managed using the [TFSSecurity command line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd#collection-level-permissions).


- By default, members of the project level **Contributors** group can subscribe to alerts for themselves.
- Members of the **Project Collection Administrators** group,
  or users who have the **Edit collection-level information**
  can set alerts in that collection for others or for a team.
- Members of the **Project Administrators** group,
  or users who have the **Edit project-level information**
  can set alerts in that project for others or for a team.

You can manage alert permissions using [TFSSecurity](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd).
