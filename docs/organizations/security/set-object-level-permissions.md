# Set object-level permissions

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

As you manage security for your organization, you can set permissions at the organization/collection-level, project-level, and object-level. This article helps you go to the security dialogs for setting permissions at the object-level, as the user interface varies somewhat across Azure Devops. For more information, see [Get started with permissions, access, and security groups](about-permissions.md#permissions).

The following items are considered objects:

- **General**: Dashboards, Analytic views, Wikis, and notifications
- Azure Boards: Area Paths, Iteration Paths, Shared queries and query folders, and more
- **Azure Pipelines**: Build and release pipelines, deployment groups, task groups, and more
- **Azure Repos**: Git repositories and branches, TFVC folders or branches
- **Azure Artifacts**: Artifacts and feeds

Work items, tags, test plans, and other test artifacts are subject to the security settings typically set at the project level or for an area path.

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Permissions** | Member of the **Project Administrators** group or explicit permissions through the individual object security dialog.|

> [!NOTE]
> TFVC only supports a single repository per project. You can set permissions for the repository or repo folders/branches, which inherit from the repo.

## Open the permissions dialog for an object section

To access the Permissions dialog for an object, follow these steps:
1. Go to the specific object.
2. Select **More** `...`.
3. Select **Security** from the dropdown menu.

> [!NOTE]
> Some objects, such as repositories and Analytics views, require at least Basic access levels. For more information, see [Access levels](access-levels.md).

## Set permissions for Dashboards, Wikis, and Analytic views

You can set permissions at the project-level and organization/collection-level for some general items, such as creating, deleting, and renaming projects. The following table provides information about setting permissions at the object-level for Dashboards, Wiki, and Analytic views.

|Object  |Default group membership  |How to access security|Inherited?  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[Dashboards](../../report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions.md)| Contributor  | Open **Dashboards**, select the area path, and then  **More** ... > **Security**. | ✔️ (project settings for team dashboard)|
|[Wiki](../../project/wiki/manage-readme-wiki-permissions.md) |Contributor |Open the wiki, choose **More** ... > **Wiki security**. For more information, see [Manage Wiki permissions](../../project/wiki/manage-readme-wiki-permissions.md). | no        |
|[Analytic views](../../report/powerbi/analytics-security.md) | Contributor & Basic|Open the analytic view, choose **More** ... > **Security**.  | no |


## Set permissions for Boards objects

The following table provides information about setting permissions at the object-level for area and iteration paths, work items, and more.


|Object  |Default group membership  |How to access security  |Inherited?  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|[Area path](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) | [Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups) |Open **Project settings** > **Project configuration** > **Areas** > next to an area, **More** ... > **Security**.         | ✔️ (child node from parent node) |
|[Iteration path](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md)    | [Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups)        | Open **Project settings** > **Project configuration** > **Iterations** > next to an iteration, **More** ... > **Security**.        | ✔️ (child node from parent node)    |
|[Work item](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md)    | Contributor        | Open **Project settings** > **Project configuration** > **Areas** > **Area path** > the work item.        | no        |
|[Work item query and query folder](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md)  | Creator of the query or folder or [Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups)        |Open the work item query or query folder > **More** ... > **Security**.         | no        |
|[Delivery Plans](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md)    | [Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups) or creator of the Delivery Plan  |Open **Boards** > **Delivery Plans** > next to a delivery plan, **More** ... > **Security**.         | no        |
|[Process](../../boards/get-started/permissions-access-boards.md)  | [Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups)        | Select **More** ... > **Security**.        | ✔️ (from Organization/Collection settings)        |

> [!NOTE]
> Work item tags - permissions get set at the project level, **Create tag definition**. Work item tags don't qualify as an object, they're defined through work items.

### Tips

Let's break down the following roles related to reviewers:

- **Changed reviewers:**
  - This role applies to any reviewer who was added or removed, due to policies defined for a set of files. 
  - For example, consider a pull request (PR) where changes are made to `File1.cs`. 
  - If a policy specifies that Person A needs to review changes to `File1.cs`, they fall into the "Changed reviewers" role for that iteration of the PR.
- **Reset reviewers:** 
  - This role is related to the "reset votes" policy. 
  - Suppose the repository has the policy “Reset votes on new pushes” configured. 
  - If Person B, who was required to review the PR, already approved it, their vote gets reset due to the policy. 
  - As a result, they're in the "Reset reviewers" role for that iteration.

## Set permissions for Repos objects

The following table provides information about setting permissions at the object-level for repos, Git repos, Git branches, and TFVC repos.

| Object | Default group membership | How to access security | Inherited? |
|--|--|--|--|
| [Repos](../../repos/git/set-git-repository-permissions.md#open-security-for-a-repository) | [Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups) | Open **Project settings**, **Repositories** > highlight your repo > **Security**. | ✔️  |
| [Git repository](../../repos/git/set-git-repository-permissions.md) |[Project Administrator](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md)  | Open **Project settings** > **Repositories** and the Git repository. | ✔️ (from project settings for Git repository) |
| [Git branch](../../repos/git/branch-permissions.md) |[Project Administrator](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md) | Open **Repos** > **Branches** > your branch > **More** ... > **Branch security**. | ✔️ |
| [TFVC repository](../../repos/tfvc/set-tfvc-repository-permissions.md) |[Project Administrator](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md) | Open **Project settings** > **Repositories** and the TFVC repository. | ✔️ |

### Tips

- **Branch permissions:**
  - Branches inherit a subset of permissions from assignments made at the repository level. 
  - For more information, see [Set branch permissions](../../repos/git/branch-permissions.md) and [Improve code quality with branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-policies.md)
- **Shared query folders:**
  - Create a shared query folder for each team.
  - Provide permissions to create and edit queries under that folder to all team members.
- **Contributors group:**
  - Adding a user to the Contributors group allows them to add and modify work items. 
  - You can restrict user and group permissions based on the area path. For more information, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking, Modify work items under an area path](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path).
::: moniker range="azure-devops"
- **Permissions report:**
  - Project Collection Administrators can [download the permissions report for a repository](download-permissions-report.md). 
  - The user interface button for this feature doesn't appear for users who aren't members of the Project Collection Administrators group.

| [Secure files](../../pipelines/policies/permissions.md#library-permissions) |[Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups)|Open your secure file > **More** ... > **Manage security.**  |✔️ (from Library permission settings)   |

## Set permissions for Artifacts objects

The following table provides information about setting permissions at the object-level for artifacts and feeds.

| Object | Default group membership | How to access security | Inherited? |
|--|--|--|--|
| [Artifacts](../../artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions.md) | [Project Administrator](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#project-level-groups)| Open **Artifacts** > Azure Artifacts settings icon. You don't see the icon if you don't have the right permissions. | no |
| [Feeds](../../artifacts/feeds/feed-permissions.md) | Project Administrator or Feed Administrator | Open your feed > **gear icon** > **Permissions** > **+ Add users/groups**. | no |

## Set permissions for Test plans objects

- Test plans, test suites, test cases, and other test objects are managed similarly to work items because they represent test-specific work item types, as discussed in [Test objects and terms](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-permissions-access-test).
- You can manage test-level permissions through project-level settings or through Area Path object-level settings. For more information, see [Set permissions and access for testing](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-permissions-access-test).

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

## Set object permissions through the command line

You can use the [az devops security command line tool](manage-tokens-namespaces.md), which allows you to view and manage permissions for various objects and features.

Here are some examples of more granular permissions that can be managed through the command line:

- **Notifications:** Use the `EventSubscription` and `EventSubscriber` namespaces.
- **Dashboards:** Read or create dashboards using the `DashboardPrivileges` namespace.
- **Service endpoints:** Use, manage, or view service endpoints through the `ServiceEndpoints` namespace.
- **Delivery plans:** View delivery plans through the `Plans` namespace.

For more information about namespaces, see [Security namespace and permission reference](namespace-reference.md).

## Set permissions for object notifications

While there isn't a user interface for setting notification permissions, some permissions can be set through command line tools and the `EventSubscription` namespace. For more information, see [Security namespace and permission reference](namespace-reference.md).

Here are some more tips for managing notifications:

- **Notification levels:**
  - Notifications can be set at different levels: User, team, project, and organization/collection.
  - Unfortunately, there isn’t a user interface specifically for setting notification permissions.
  - However, some permissions can be configured through command-line tools and the EventSubscription namespace.
- **Skip initiator option:**
  - If you don’t want to receive notifications for events that you initiated, enable the Skip initiator option.
  - This prevents notifications for actions you started.
  - For more information, see [Exclude yourself from notification emails for events that you start](../../organizations/notifications/exclude-self-from-email.md).
- **Organization-wide notifications:**
  - Azure DevOps doesn’t directly support organization-wide notifications.
  - As an alternative, consider providing an email distribution list that reaches your entire organization.
  - In Azure DevOps Services you can create a banner using the `az devops banner` command that all users see when they sign in.
