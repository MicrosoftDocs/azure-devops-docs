# Add a user who can make purchases for Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

To let a user manage billing or make purchases through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) for your organization, go to the **Azure DevOps** tab and
add [**owner**](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [**contributor**](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), [**service admin**](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#change-the-service-administrator-for-an-azure-subscription), or [**co-admin**](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-or-change-co-administrator) roles to users in the Azure subscription that's linked to your organization.

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the Azure subscription administrator.

2. Enter *subscriptions* in the search box, and then select **Subscriptions** from the drop-down menu. If more than one subscription is listed, choose the subscription to modify.
