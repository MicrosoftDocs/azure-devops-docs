# Add a user who can set up billing for Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

In this article, learn how to let a user [set up billing](set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs.md) or [change billing](change-azure-subscription.md) for your organization. Go to the **Subscriptions** tab and
add [**Owner**](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [**Contributor**](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), [**Service admin**](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#change-the-service-administrator-for-an-azure-subscription), or [**Co-admin**](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-or-change-co-administrator) roles to users in the Azure subscription that your organization uses for Azure DevOps billing.

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as the Azure subscription administrator.

2. Enter *subscriptions* in the search box, and then select **Subscriptions** from the drop-down menu. If more than one subscription is listed, choose the subscription to modify.

7. If your update is complete, choose **Save**.

A user who can [set up](set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs.md) or [change billing](change-azure-subscription.md) is added to your organization.

>[!Note]
>To give access to a user who's not in your directory, the user must accept the invitation that's received via email before they can access the Azure subscription.
