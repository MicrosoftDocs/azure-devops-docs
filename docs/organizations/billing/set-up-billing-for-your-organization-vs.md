# Set up billing

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

Set up billing in Azure DevOps before making purchases, so you have it in place once you're ready to buy. You only need to set up billing once for your organization. 

*All services are billed via Azure*. You're not required to use any other Azure services.

[!INCLUDE [pricing-calculator-tip](../../includes/pricing-calculator-tip.md)]

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).
* To set up billing, you must have [Project Collection Administrator or organization Owner permissions](../security/lookup-organization-owner-admin.md) in Azure DevOps.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) isn't supported.

## Set up billing for your organization

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.
