# Quickstart: Set up billing for your VSTS organization

**VSTS**

Make a purchase in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) to set up billing for your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) organization. During that process, we'll prompt you for an Azure subscription where charges should apply. We'll also allow you to create a new Azure subscription if you don't have one already.

This quickstart will help you set up billing for your VSTS organization in advance of making purchases, so that you'll have this in place when you're ready to buy. But the preferred method is to simply make an initial purchase.

*All VSTS services are billed via Azure*, and you're not required to use any other Azure services.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin. Note that the Azure free trial is not supported.

## Prerequisites

The first time that you set up billing for your VSTS organization - whether via the Azure portal or as part of making a purchase in the Visual Studio Marketplace - you'll need:

* [VSTS project collection administrator or organization owner permissions](../accounts/faq-add-delete-users.md#find-owner)
* [An Azure subscription that you can use to purchase](add-backup-billing-managers.md)

To make subsequent edits to paid quantities in your VSTS organization, you only need access to purchase on the Azure subscription.

## Set up billing via the Azure portal

If you want to set up billing for your organization before buying something in the Visual Studio Marketplace, you can do so from the Azure portal.

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as VSTS organization owner and as Azure subscription co-administrator or greater.

2. Select **All services** and then select **Team Services administration**.

5. Select your Azure subscription and then select **Link**.

 After Azure sets up the link, your VSTS organization appears linked to your Azure subscription.
