# Set up billing

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Set up billing in Azure DevOps before you make purchases, so it's already in place once you're ready to buy. You only need to set up billing once for your organization. Once you select an Azure subscription for billing, you can purchase more user licenses by adding the user to the organization and assigning them a license.

*All services get billed via Azure*. You're not required to use any other Azure services.

[!INCLUDE [pricing-calculator-tip](../../includes/pricing-calculator-tip.md)]

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/) now.
* You must be a member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) isn't supported.

## Set up billing for your organization

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

Billing is set up for your Azure DevOps organization. Later on if needed, you can [review your individual Azure subscription bill](/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/review-individual-bill) .

> [!NOTE]
> A user interface limitation prevents the subscription picker from displaying more than 50 subscriptions. If your user account has access to more than 50 subscriptions and the target subscription you want to change the billing for isn't visible, you can create a new user account. Grant the account Owner/Contributor rights to the target subscription and Administrator privileges to the Azure DevOps organization. Use the new account to link the organization to the target subscription.
