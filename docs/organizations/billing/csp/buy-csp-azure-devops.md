# Cloud Solution Providers: Buy Azure DevOps resources for your customers

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program can purchase [Azure DevOps resources](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/pricing) for
your customers, including users (who get Basic features), Test Manager, Azure Artifacts, Private Pipelines, and
Hosted Pipelines.

>[!Note]
>[Azure DevOps Services was previously called Visual Studio Team Services or VSTS](../../../user-guide/what-happened-vsts.md).

## Prerequisites

To set up billing for a customer who's already created an organization by using a Microsoft account identity
(in other words, not an identity in their Azure Active Directory), your customer must do the following:

1. [Change their organization to be backed by their Azure Active Directory](../../accounts/access-with-azure-ad.md).
2. [Remove the link to the existing Azure subscription that's used for billing on their organization](../change-azure-subscription.md), if they had previously set up billing.

Make sure your identity hasn't been added into the customer's Azure Active Directory. If it has, you need to have the identity removed before you can go through the purchasing steps for your customer.
