# Cloud Solution Providers: Buy Azure DevOps resources for your customers

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program can purchase [Azure DevOps resources](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/pricing) for
your customers. This purchase includes users (who get Basic features), Test Manager, Azure Artifacts, Private Pipelines, and
Hosted Pipelines.

>[!Note]
>[Azure DevOps Services was previously called Visual Studio Team Services or VSTS](../../../user-guide/what-is-azure-devops.md#vsts).

## Prerequisites

Your customer must complete the following tasks to set up billing. This customer must have already created an organization by using a Microsoft account identity. In other words, not an identity in their Azure Active Directory.

1. [Change their organization to be backed by their Azure Active Directory](../../accounts/access-with-azure-ad.md).
2. [...](../change-azure-subscription.md), if they had previously set up billing.

Make sure your identity hasn't been added into the customer's Azure Active Directory. If it has, you must remove the identity before you go through the purchasing steps for your customer.
