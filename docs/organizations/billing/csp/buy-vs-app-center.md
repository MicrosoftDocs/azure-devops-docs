# Cloud Solution Providers: Buy Visual Studio App Center resources

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../../includes/version-all.md)]

Partners in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program can enable their customers to purchase [Visual Studio App Center resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-center/) by using a CSP-based Azure subscription. Resources include build pipelines, test device concurrencies, and advanced push notifications.

To enable the customer to purchase App Center resources by using a CSP-based Azure subscription, confirm the following:

* The customer has organization administration rights in App Center, which grants them access to the Billing tab.

* The customer has owner role permissions to the CSP-based Azure subscription in order to make purchases. Learn more about [how to add users with co-owner permissions](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator).
