# Cloud Solution Providers: Buy Visual Studio App Center resources

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

If you're a partner in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, you can enable your customers to purchase [Visual Studio App Center resources](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-center/) by using a CSP-based Azure subscription. Resources include build pipelines, test device concurrencies, and advanced push notifications.

To enable your customer to purchase [App Center resources](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/app-center/) by using a CSP-based Azure subscription, confirm the following statements are true:

* The customer has organization administration rights in App Center, which grants them access to the **Billing** tab in Azure DevOps.

* The customer has Owner role permissions to the [CSP-based Azure subscription](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home) to make purchases. 
 
For more information, see [how to add users with co-owner permissions](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator).
