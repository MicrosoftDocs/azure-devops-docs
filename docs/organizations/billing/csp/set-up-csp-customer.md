# Cloud Solution Providers: Set up billing for your customers for Azure DevOps Services and Visual Studio

## Azure DevOps Services 

Partners in the [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider) program can purchase Azure DevOps Services, Visual Studio cloud subscriptions, and Xamarin University for their customers via the [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com). 

## Get started  

Partners need the appropriate permissions role to purchase in the Partner Center. Learn more about [roles in Partner Center](https://msdn.microsoft.com/partner-center/create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions). 

Set up a customer and CSP-based Azure subscription in the Partner Center by completing the following steps:

## Customer set up steps from video

1. Sign in to your [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com) account. 
2. On the dashboard, choose **Add new customer**. Or add a new customer from the **Customers** page. Provide the customer's details and advance to the customer's subscriptions.
3. Add an Azure subscription, which the marketplace uses for billing. Customers can have as many Azure subscriptions as needed. Choose **Add subscription**, and then **Microsoft Azure** to add more.
4. Review your order and select **Submit**.

At first, new subscriptions have the subscription name **Microsoft Azure**. So be sure to give subscriptions
appropriate nicknames. Choose the subscription name, enter a new subscription nickname, and submit.

Now you're ready to buy Visual Studio. To purchase Visual Studio for a customer, choose the appropriate customer. Then choose **service management**. If you haven't added an Azure subscription for the customer, the **Visual Studio Marketplace** and **Manage Visual Studio Subscriptions** links won't appear.

Go to the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab, to purchase Visual Studio cloud subscriptions and Azure DevOps resources for your customers. Choose **Manage Visual Studio Subscriptions** to assign subscriptions you've already purchased for your
customer's end users. You can also delete existing assigned subscriptions or reassign them to a different user.

## Convert your customers from other Azure billing to CSP
If your customers have been buying Azure DevOps, Visual Studio cloud subscriptions, or Xamarin University directly through Microsoft, and they want to transition to paying through you as a CSP, they'll need to take the following steps:
1. Reduce their paid amounts to zero.
2. Let you know the ongoing paid amounts of each service and product to start billing on the first day of the next calendar month. For Visual Studio annual cloud subscriptions, customers need to tell you the month, or months, to start purchases of these subscriptions. Then they can continue coverage from the date it expires from their existing annual cloud subscription purchases.

For Azure DevOps, see additional details about [buying Azure DevOps through CSP](buy-csp-azure-devops.md).

## Convert your customers from CSP billing

If your customers choose to stop buying Azure DevOps Services, Visual Studio cloud subscriptions, or Xamarin University through you as a CSP, you'll need to reduce the paid amounts to zero. Then are no renewal charges when these purchases expire. Most purchases are valid through the end of the calendar month. Examples are Azure DevOps Services users, Test Manager, Azure Artifacts, Visual Studio monthly cloud subscriptions, and Xamarin University. Visual Studio annual cloud subscriptions are valid for a year from purchase. Make sure to keep the Azure subscription that made the purchases active until all the purchases have expired. Canceling the Azure subscription earlier interrupts the customer's use of the purchases.

## How to look up CSP pricing

To view Azure DevOps Services, Visual Studio cloud subscription, and Xamarin University pricing for CSP partners, sign in to the 
[Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com). Choose **Pricing and offers** from the left pane. Choose the current month pricing file under **usage-based services** on the upper right. Once the Excel spreadsheet downloads, go to the **Azure Price List** sheet. Filter the **Meter Category** column to **Visual Studio**.

> [!NOTE]
> Partners purchase Azure DevOps Services, Visual Studio cloud subscriptions, and Xamarin University in the CSP program through the Partner Center. 
> At this time, there's no API for automation.
