### Q: 	Why don't I see my organization in the Visual Studio Marketplace?

A: If you don't see your organization when buying from the Visual Studio Marketplace, try these steps:

1.	Check the identity that you use to sign in to the Visual Studio Marketplace. In the upper-right corner, select your user name to view your profile. 
1.	On the left, make sure your email address and directory are correct.
1.	Close all browser windows.
1.	Open a private or incognito browsing session.
1.	Sign in to the Visual Studio Marketplace. Use the identity of a user in the organization that you want.

	> [!TIP]
	> If you're asked to choose "work or school account" or "personal account", then you used an email address that's the same for a Microsoft account and a "work or school account" that's managed by your organization in Azure Active Directory. Although these identities have the same email address, they're still separate identities with different profiles, security settings, and permissions.
