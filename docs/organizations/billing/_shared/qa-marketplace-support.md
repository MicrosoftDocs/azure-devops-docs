### Q: How do I get support for the Visual Studio Marketplace?  

A: Who to contact depends on the support you need: 

* Billing questions - [Azure billing support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

* Visual Studio subscriptions - [subscriptions support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/support).

* Help with Azure DevOps - [Azure DevOps support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/devops-visual-studio-team-services).

* Help with Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) - [TFS support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/tfs_support).

### Q: Can I use an Enterprise Agreement to buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace? 

A:	Yes. Buy directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab. You can bill purchases to the Azure subscription created under your [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/). Don't order Visual Studio Marketplace services through your reseller. 


### Q: How can I tell whether I have the necessary privileges to buy services in the Visual Studio Marketplace through my organization's Enterprise Agreement? 

A: To find out if you have the right privileges, select the **Buy** button for a service offered in the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab. Then select an Azure subscription, which is a billing account, from the list of Azure subscriptions that are currently linked to your user name and password. The name of the Azure subscription defaults to the type of billing account. Examples are **Pay-As-You-Go** and **Enterprise Agreement**. So it's often clear if the Azure subscription is part of your Enterprise Agreement.

Another approach is to try to visit the [Azure Enterprise Portal](http://ea.azure.com). If you can reach it, then you have either the Enterprise Admin or the Account Owner role. Only Account Owners can set up new Azure billing accounts in an Enterprise Agreement. If you can't access the Azure Enterprise Portal, inquire within your organization to find out who your Enterprise Admin is. Ask that person to add you as an Account Owner within the Azure Enterprise Portal. If you're unable to find this person, you can [submit a support ticket](https://aka.ms/AzureEntSupport) and request the contact information. You need your organization's name and your Enterprise Agreement enrollment number for the support ticket.
