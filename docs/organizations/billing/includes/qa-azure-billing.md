### Q: How does Azure billing work?

A: When you buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace, you select an Azure subscription to use for billing. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [sign up](https://portal.azure.com) either before or during your first purchase. Set up payment with a credit card, or by invoice in some cases. Charges for your purchases show on your monthly Azure bill.

>[!NOTE] 
> Keep your Azure subscription in good standing to use your Visual Studio Marketplace purchases. If your Azure subscription gets canceled or disabled (for example, because the credit card used for payment expires), any purchases with the Azure subscription get deactivated on the first day of the next month. To continue using your Visual Studio Marketplace purchases, keep your Azure subscription active and updated.


### Q: Can I use an Enterprise Agreement to buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace?

A: Yes. Buy directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab. You can bill purchases to the Azure subscription that was created under your [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/). Don't order Visual Studio Marketplace services through your reseller.

### Q: Can I use the Azure Monetary Commitment funds from my Enterprise Agreement to buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace?

A: Yes. You can use the [Azure Prepayment](/marketplace/azure-consumption-commitment-benefit) (previously called monetary commitment) funds from your Enterprise Agreement to pay for the following items:

*	[Azure DevOps users](../buy-basic-access-add-users.md)
*	[Microsoft-published extensions for Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops)
*	[Virtual user minutes for cloud-based load testing](/../organizations/billing/buy-more-build-vs)

You can't use these funds to pay for Visual Studio cloud subscriptions and non-Microsoft extensions for Azure DevOps.

### Q: Can I use the Azure free account to buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace?

A: No. You can't use the [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) to pay for Visual Studio Marketplace purchases. Instead, set up a separate Pay-As-You-Go Azure subscription before or during your purchase. 

### Q: Can I use the monthly Azure credits from Visual Studio subscriptions or Visual Studio Dev Essentials to buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace?

A: No. You can't use the monthly Azure credits from [Visual Studio subscriptions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/subscriber-benefits-vs) or [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx) to pay for Visual Studio Marketplace purchases. You can use the included Azure subscriptions to bill your purchases. Before you make purchases, [remove your spending limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/) from the following subscriptions:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prevent your Azure subscription from being disabled when your monthly charges get billed the following month, remove your spending limit indefinitely. Otherwise, all resources billed to the subscription get suspended, including virtual machines and all other workloads.

### Q: Where can I check my bill or correct any billing information on my Azure subscription?

A: If you're the Azure Account Administrator, go to the [Azure Account portal](https://account.windowsazure.com).
