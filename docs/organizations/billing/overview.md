## Services billed via Azure

During your first purchase for your organization, you're prompted to select the Azure subscription to use for billing. The subscription can be part of your Enterprise Agreement, Pay-As-You-Go, Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), or other types of Azure subscriptions. All services get billed via Azure. You aren't required to pay for or use any other Azure services.
