# Billing overview for Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Set up billing when you need more than the *free tier* of resources in your organization, or to buy other features for your users that are offered by Microsoft or other companies via the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), on the Azure DevOps tab.

The Free tier includes:

* Five Azure DevOps users (Basic).
* Five Azure Artifacts users.
* Free Tier of Microsoft-hosted CI/CD (one concurrent job, up to 30 hours per month).
* One self-hosted CI/CD concurrent job.
* 20,000 virtual user minutes of cloud-based load testing.

> During your first purchase for your organization, you're prompted to select the Azure subscription to use for billing. The subscription can be part of your Enterprise Agreement, Pay-As-You-Go, Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), or other types of Azure subscriptions. All services are billed via Azure. You aren't required to pay for or use any other Azure services.
> 
> These are the paid services that are offered by Microsoft:
>
> * [Azure DevOps users/Basic](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-vstsuser)
> * [Microsoft-hosted CI/CD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.build-release-hosted-pipelines) (formerly hosted pipelines)
> * [Self-hosted CI/CD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.build-release-private-pipelines) (formerly private pipelines)
> * [Azure Test Plans](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web) (formerly Test Manager)
> * [Azure Artifacts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed) (formerly Package Management)
>
> [Cloud-based load testing](buy-load-testing-vs.md) is charged based on the load tests that you run. By default, paid usage is turned off for your organization.
> You can only enable paid usage via the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

The first time that you set up billing for your organization, whether you do the setup via the Azure portal or as part of making a purchase in the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab, you need:

* [Project collection administrator or organization owner permissions](../accounts/faq-add-delete-users.md#find-owner).
* [The **owner** or **contributor** role on your Azure subscription](add-backup-billing-managers.md).

To make subsequent changes to the amount of paid resources, you only need to have [access to the Azure subscription](add-backup-billing-managers.md).

## Next steps

* [Set up billing](set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs.md)
* [Add user who can make purchases or backup billing manager](add-backup-billing-managers.md)
* [Change the Azure subscription for billing](change-azure-subscription.md)
