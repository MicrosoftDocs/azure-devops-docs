# Change your organization's billing subscription

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Learn how to change the Azure subscription that your Azure DevOps organization uses for billing. You might do so if your organization is tied to a subscription of a user who's left the organization. In this case, you'd likely switch to a common subscription or remove the billing. You can [remove your billing subscription](#remove-your-billing-subscription) at any time.

## Prerequisites

Have the following permissions to change your organization's billing subscription:

- [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.
- [Owner or Contributor permission for the Azure subscription](add-backup-billing-managers.md), which you can use to purchase.

Azure DevOps bills the newly saved subscription for your organization.

## Remove your billing subscription 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you remove the billing subscription from your organization, any paid quantities of Basic, Azure Artifacts users, Azure Test Plans users, Microsoft-hosted CI/CD, and self-hosted CI/CD go back to the [free tier](billing-faq.yml) of service immediately.
>  
>If you delete your organization resource in the Azure Portal, do so *after* you change the billing subscription in Azure DevOps and not before, to avoid your organization reverting to the free tier of service.

1. Sign in to your organization, choose ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings** > **Billing**, and then **Change billing**, following steps 1 through 4 provided in the [Change the subscription](#change-subscription) section.

2. Choose **Remove billing**, and then choose **Save**. 

Azure DevOps removes your billing subscription from your organization.
