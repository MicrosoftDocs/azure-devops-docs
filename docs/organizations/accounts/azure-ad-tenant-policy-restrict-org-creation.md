# Restrict organization creation via Microsoft Entra tenant policy

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Learn how to turn on the Microsoft Entra tenant policy, which restricts users from creating an organization in Azure DevOps. This policy is turned off, by default.

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
|**Permissions**|[Azure DevOps Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference). To check your role, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home), and go to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Roles and administrators**. If you're not an Azure DevOps administrator, you can't see the policies. Contact your administrator, if necessary. The Project Collection Administrator role isn't required. |

## Turn on the policy

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

3. Select **Microsoft Entra ID**, and then switch the toggle to turn on the policy, restricting organization creation.

## Optional

### Create allowlist

> [!WARNING]
> We recommend using groups with your tenant policy allowlist. If you use a named user, be aware that a reference to the named user's identity resides in the United States, Europe (EU), and Southeast Asia (Singapore).

When the policy is enabled, all users are restricted from creating new organizations. To grant exceptions, add users to an allowlist. Users on the allowlist can create new organizations but can't manage the policy.

Select **Add Microsoft Entra user or group**.

For more information, see [Add organization users and manage access](add-organization-users.md).

### Create error message

When administrators, who aren't on the allowlist, try to create an organization they get an error. 

To customize this error message, do the following steps:

1. In the policy settings in Azure DevOps, select **Edit display message**.

2. Enter your customized message, and then select **Save**.

The error message is customized.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrators, who aren't on the allowlist, can't connect their organization to the Microsoft Entra tenant where the policy is turned on.
