# Add external users to your organization

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Learn how to invite external users to your organization, if you access Azure DevOps via Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). To do so, you must add the identities of those users to your Azure AD and organizations. Doing this also grants the users some additional privileges. Learn more about the [additional organization-level resources](resources-granted-to-project-members.md).

## Prerequisites

* You must set the policy **External guest access** to **On** for the organization that you want to invite external users to.

* You must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators group for the organization that you want to invite external users to.

* The organization to which you want to invite external users must allow for external invitations. Go to the **Organization Settings** page to confirm.

* The Azure AD tenant to which you want to invite external users must allow you to add new users based on your Azure Active Directory guest policies. Learn [how to become eligible to invite external users on your Azure AD tenant](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-delegate-invitations).

5. Advise the external user to locate the email that they received from Azure DevOps and go to the redemption URL. The external user must navigate through an Azure B2B redemption experience, which adds the user to your organization.

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Go to the **Users** tab in **Settings**.
