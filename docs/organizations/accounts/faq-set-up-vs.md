# Troubleshoot setting up Visual Studio with Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

## Visual Studio

<a name="why-sign-in"></a>

#### Q: Why sign in?

A: Your Visual Studio settings, 
like automatic brace completion, 
are saved with your profile. 
These settings roam with your [personal Microsoft account](https://www.microsoft.com/account), 
or your [work or school account](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sign-up-organization/), 
when you sign in to Visual Studio on any computer. 

Sign in to Visual Studio during the 30-day 
trial period for these benefits:

*	Visual Studio Enterprise: Extend your trial for 90 days. When your trial expires, 
learn [how to unlock Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn950037.aspx).
*	Visual Studio Express or Community: Continue to use this edition for free.

When you create your profile, 
you can also create an organization.

that's managed by Azure Active Directory.
