# Separate your organization from Azure Active Directory

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

<a name="DisconnectDirectory"></a>

To stop using your organization's directory and return to signing in with Microsoft accounts, you can disconnect your organization from your directory.

For more information, see the [Conceptual overview](access-with-azure-ad.md) for using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with Azure DevOps.

## Prerequisites

* Before you disconnect your organization from your directory, make sure to **change the organization owner to a Microsoft account** and not to a school or work account. You can't sign in to your organization unless your work or school account has the same email address as your Microsoft account.

* [Microsoft accounts](`https://signup.live.com/?lic=1`) for all users in your organization, including yourself as organization owner.

* [Organization ownership](faq-change-app-access.md#find-owner) for your Microsoft account. 

* Global administrator permissions in your Azure AD for your Microsoft account as the organization owner. You need both because Azure AD users can't disconnect organizations from directories. You can add Microsoft accounts to a directory as external users.

Learn about how to [Manage Azure administrators](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-assign-admin-roles/).

**What happens to current users?**  Users continue working seamlessly if they have Microsoft accounts that share the same sign-in addresses that they use now. Otherwise, users won't have access until you add them to Azure DevOps as new users. Users can migrate everything except work history. They can reconnect Visual Studio subscriptions and have their access levels reassigned to their new identities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to connect your organization to a different Azure Active Directory at any time, ensure that any connected organizations are disconnected from the original directory BEFORE you delete that directory. Once a new directory is established, connect your organizations to the new directory so users can regain access. Learn more about [connecting your organization to Azure AD](connect-organization-to-azure-ad.md).

## Disconnect organization from directory

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with your Microsoft account as the organization owner.
