# Get list of organizations backed by Microsoft Entra ID

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Learn how to download a comprehensive list of organizations backed by a Microsoft Entra ID tenant. This list includes essential information such as:

- Organization IDs
- Organization names
- Organization URLs
- Organization owners

By accessing this information, you can efficiently manage and oversee the organizations connected to your Microsoft Entra ID tenant.

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
|**Organization connection** |Member of an Azure DevOps organization [connected to Microsoft Entra ID](connect-organization-to-azure-ad.md).|

## Get list of organizations

#### [Browser](#tab/browser)

Using any organization backed by your Microsoft Entra ID, complete the following steps. If you don't have access to an organization, create one by signing in to [Start.VisualStudio.com](https://start.visualstudio.com/) with your Microsoft Entra identity. You can [delete the organization](delete-your-organization.md) when you're done.

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli/)

You can get a list of organizations backed by Microsoft Entra ID by using the [az account list](/cli/azure/devops/user#az-devops-user-add) command. To get started, see [Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).

1. To get a list of Microsoft Entra ID tenants, use the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az account list --output table
   ```

   This command lists all the tenants you have access to.

2.  Currently, there's no direct Azure CLI command to list Azure DevOps organizations connected to a specific Microsoft Entra ID tenant. But, you can use the Azure DevOps REST API in combination with the Azure CLI to do so.

   1. Set the Azure DevOps organization and project:
   
      ```azurecli
      az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/{My_Organization}/
      ```

   2. Use the REST API to list organizations. Ensure you have a personal access token (PAT). You can [generate a PAT from Azure DevOps](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md). Use the following command to list projects with an organization:

      ```azurerestapi
      az rest --method get --uri https://dev.azure.com/{My_Organization}/_apis/projects?api-version=6.0 --headers "Authorization=Bearer {PAT}"
      ```

   This process should correctly authenticate and retrieve the list or organizations connected to your Microsoft Entra ID.
