# Get list of organizations backed by Azure AD

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Learn how to download a complete list of organizations backed by an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. 
On this list, you can find the following information:
- organization IDs
- organization names
- organization URLs
- organization owners

## Prerequisites

You must be a member of an Azure DevOps organization [connected to Azure AD.](connect-organization-to-azure-ad.md)

## Get list of organizations

Using any organization backed by your Azure AD, complete the following steps. If you don't have access to an organization, create one by signing in to [Start.VisualStudio.com](https://start.visualstudio.com/) with your Azure AD identity. You can [delete the organization](delete-your-organization.md) when you're done.

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.
