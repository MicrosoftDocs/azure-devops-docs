# Tutorial: Connect your organization to Azure Active Directory

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

If your organization was created with a Microsoft account, you can connect that account to your [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/). You can then sign in to Azure DevOps with the same username and password that you use with the Microsoft services.

In this tutorial, you learn how to do the following tasks:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Connect your organization to your Azure Active Directory.
> * Close the temporary Microsoft account (MSA), if you created one.
> * Update the Azure subscription that your organization uses for billing.

For more information, see the [conceptual overview](access-with-azure-ad.md) about using Azure AD with Azure DevOps.

>[!Note]
>Azure DevOps Services was previously called Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

## Prerequisites

1. Inform users of the upcoming change.
   There's no downtime during this change, but users are affected by it. Let them know before you begin that there's a short series of steps they must complete. As your company transitions from Microsoft account (MSA) to Azure AD identities, your users' benefits continue with their new identity, as long as their emails match.

2. The user who makes the connection must have the following:

* User exists in Azure AD as a member
* User is a *project collection administrator* or [*owner* of the organization](../security/lookup-organization-owner-admin.md)
* User isn't using the Microsoft account identity that matches the Azure AD identity. For example, if the Microsoft account that users are currently using is *jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com*, the Azure AD identity they'll use after connecting is also *jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com*. Use a single identity that spans both applications, rather than two separate identities using the same email. For example, an MSA that's in Azure AD. If the email addresses are the same, complete the following steps. If the addresses aren't the same, continue on to connect your organization to your Azure AD

   1. [Create a new MSA](https://signup.live.com/) (for example, *Fabrikam@outlook.com*). This account is only temporary and can be [deleted later](#optional-close-the-temporary-msa-if-you-created-one).
   2. Sign in to your organization as a *project collection administrator*, and [add the new user](add-organization-users.md) as a member of the organization.
   3. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and add the new user as a B2B guest of Azure AD.  An email invitation is sent to the new user.
   4. Go to your email invitations from Azure and select **Call-To-Action** in each message.
   5. Select **Next/Continue** to fully register the new user.
   6. Sign in to your organization as the new user.
   7. Go to **Settings** and change the owner of the organization to the new user.
   8. As the new user, complete the remaining steps to connect your organization to Azure AD.  

   Users' email addresses are the same before and after the connection. For example, if users currently sign in to their Microsoft account (MSA) with the email address *jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com*, they sign in with the same email address as their Azure AD identity. We'll update this article when we have a solution for scenarios where email addresses must be changed.

## All Azure DevOps users in Azure AD

Make sure all Azure DevOps users are in Azure AD by completing the following steps.  

> [!NOTE]
> Any user that isn't in your Azure AD is a "historic" user and can't sign in. However, the user's history is retained.

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation-cloud.md)]

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).
2. Select ![gear icon](../../_img/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.
  ![Open Organization settings](../../_shared/_img/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)
6. Select **Users**.
  ![Open organization settings, users](../../_shared/_img/settings/open-organization-settings-users-vert.png)
7. Compare your Azure DevOps email list with your Azure Active Directory email list.

   * If any users exist on the **Users** page but are missing from Azure AD, [add them as B2B guests](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-iw-add-users).

    ![Add a guest user to Azure AD](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/add-new-users.png)

    These guests can be external to your organization (*User@othercompany.com*) or existing MSA users (*user@outlook.com* or *user@gmail.com*).

   * If you don't have permissions to invite users, in **User Settings**, select **Yes**.

    ![The "External users" pane](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/external-user-settings-aad.png)

    If you have recently modified these settings or assigned the *guest inviter* role to a user, there might be a 15 minute to 60 minute wait before the changes take effect.

   * If no paid license exists in your Azure AD, every invited user gets the rights that the Azure AD free account offers.

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

4. Sign in to your organization and go to **Organization settings**.
  ![Go to organization settings](../../_shared/_img/settings/open-account-settings.png)
5. Go to **Users**.
  ![The Users tab](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/select-users-to-review-email-addresses-for-azure-ad.png)
6. Compare the list of email addresses in Azure DevOps with the list of email addresses in your Azure Active Directory.

   * If any users exist on the **Users** page but are missing from Azure AD, [add them as B2B guests](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-iw-add-users).

    ![Add a guest user to Azure AD](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/add-new-users.png)

    These guests can be external to your organization (*User@othercompany.com*) or existing MSA users (*user@outlook.com* or *user@gmail.com*).

   * If you don't have permissions to invite users, update the **User Settings** page.

      ![The "External users" pane](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/external-user-settings-aad.png)

    If you have recently modified these settings or assigned the *guest inviter* role to a user, there might be a 15 minute to 60 minute wait before the changes take effect.

   If no paid license exists in your Azure AD, every invited user gets the rights that the Azure AD free account offers.

## Connect your organization to your Azure AD

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to connect your organization to a different Azure Active Directory, disconnect from the original directory BEFORE you delete that directory. Once a new directory is established, connect your organizations to the new directory so users can regain access. Learn more about [disconnecting your organization from Azure AD](disconnect-organization-from-azure-ad.md).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the Microsoft account that you chose in the previous section.

    Make sure you're connected to the correct directory. Select the directory at the upper right corner of the page.

    ![Confirm Azure AD connection](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/confirm-directory-azure-ad.png)

2. Select **All services**, and then **Azure DevOps organizations**.

   ![All services, organizations](_img/_shared/azure-portal-team-services-administration.png)

3. Select your organization.  
    If you don't see your organization, make sure you're using the directory that's displayed in the Azure portal at the upper right. Also, confirm that you're signed in with a Microsoft account that is the owner of the organization.

   ![Select your organization](_img/_shared/azure-portal-select-organization.png)

4. Select **Connect AAD**.

   ![Connect to Azure AD](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/azure-portal-choose-connect.png)

5. Select **Yes** to connect.

   ![Select Yes to connect](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/choose-yes-to-connect.png)

6. Your organization is now connected to your Azure AD.

7. Confirm that the process is complete. Open your browser in a private session and sign in to your organization with your Azure AD or work credentials.

   ![Confirm connected directory](_img/_shared/azure-portal-confirm-connected-directory.png)

8. If you created a temporary user to complete the migration, change the owner of the organization back to the initial user. Then, delete the temporary Microsoft account, which is no longer needed.

## Inform users of the completed change

Visual Studio subscription administrators assign subscriptions to users' corporate email so that they'll receive the subscription welcome email and notifications. If the identity and subscription email messages match, users can access the benefits of that subscription.

When you inform your users of the completed change, include the tasks that each user in the organization must complete, as follows:

1. If you use Visual Studio or the Git command-line tool, you might need to clear the cache for the [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/blob/master/Docs/Faq.md#q-why-is-gitexe-failing-to-authenticate-after-linkingunlinking-your-visual-studio-team-services-organization-from-azure-active-directory).  
    Deleting the *%LocalAppData%\GitCredentialManager\tenant.cache* file on each client machine resolves the issue.

2. If you use the alternate authentication tokens that are used by tools or scripts, [regenerate new tokens](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) for the Azure AD users. Complete the following steps:

    a. On your Azure DevOps page, at the upper right, select your profile image, and then select **Security**.

    b. On the SSH public keys page, select **Add**. Enter a description, and then, at the bottom of the page, select **Create token**.

    c. When the token is created, make a note of it or copy it to the clipboard. It can't be viewed again.

3. If you use SSH tokens, [add new keys for the Azure AD user](../../repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate.md).
4. If you don't want to be prompted to choose between accounts, [rename your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/11545/microsoft-account-rename-your-personal-account) to a different email that doesn't conflict with your Azure AD identity. Or, if you no longer need it, [close your Microsoft account](connect-organization-to-azure-ad.md#optional-close-the-temporary-msa-if-you-created-one).

5. If you used a Microsoft account to sign up for a [Visual Studio with MSDN subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) you can add to the subscription a work or school account that's managed by Azure AD. The subscription must have Azure DevOps as a benefit. To learn how to link work or school accounts to Visual Studio with MSDN subscriptions, see [Managing subscriptions](/visualstudio/subscriptions/manage-vs-subscriptions).

## Optional

<a name="optional-close-the-temporary-msa-if-you-created-one"></a>

### Close the temporary MSA (if you created one)

1. In Azure DevOps, go to the **Settings** page, and then [change the organization owner](change-organization-ownership-vs.md) back to yourself.
2. On the **Users** page, remove the temporary new user.
3. Go to the Azure portal, and remove the new user from the Azure AD.
4. [Close the temporary MSA](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412/microsoft-account-how-to-close-account) that you created previously.

### Update the Azure subscription that your organization uses for billing

After you connect your organization to Azure AD, you might need to update the Azure subscription that you've been using to pay for Azure DevOps.

If your Azure DevOps subscription is associated with a directory other than the one you connect to, you can't buy or change the purchases you’ve already made. Your existing paid resources continue to work and charges renew each month. But, when you try to make changes in the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab, you’ll see something similar to the following message:

![Select Azure subscription for Azure DevOps billing](_img/connect-organization-to-aad/select-azure-subscription.png)

Set up billing by using one of the following options:

* [Associate the subscription with the directory](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory) that you’re now using to sign in to Azure DevOps. If you’re unable to change the directory in the Azure portal, you can [transfer the subscription to your work Azure AD identity](/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer).

* If you have a different Azure subscription to use for billing, you can [change the Azure subscription Azure DevOps uses for billing](../billing/change-azure-subscription.md).
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Follow the article instructions carefully, because this option can disrupt billing for your organization if it isn’t set up correctly.

## FAQ

### Q: Will my users keep their existing Visual Studio subscriptions?

A: Visual Studio subscription administrators ordinarily assign subscriptions to users' corporate email addresses, so that users can receive welcome email and notifications. If the identity and subscription email addresses match, users can access the benefits of the subscription.

As you transition from Microsoft to Azure AD identities, users' benefits still work with their new Azure AD identity. But, the email addresses must match. If the email addresses don't match, your subscription administrator must [reassign the subscription](../billing/csp/buy-vs-app-center.md). Otherwise, users must [add an alternate identity to their Visual Studio subscription](/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity).

### Q: What if I'm required to sign in when I use the identity picker?

A: Clear your browser cache, and delete any cookies for the session.

### Q: What if my work items are indicating that the users aren't valid?

A: Clear your browser cache, and delete any cookies for the session.
