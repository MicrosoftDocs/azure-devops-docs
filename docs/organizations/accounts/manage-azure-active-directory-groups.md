# Manage access with Microsoft Entra groups

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

To control access to your team's critical resources and key business assets in Azure DevOps Services, use Microsoft services like Microsoft 365 or [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/). [Microsoft Entra ID works with your organization](access-with-azure-ad.md) to control access and authenticate users.

Organize your directory members with [Microsoft Entra groups](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups) and manage permissions in bulk for your organization. Add these groups to built-in groups like Project Collection Administrators or Contributors, or to custom groups like your project management team. Microsoft Entra group members inherit permissions from the Azure DevOps group, so you don't have to manage group members individually.

For more information on [Microsoft Entra ID benefits](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) and how to [control organization access with Microsoft accounts or Microsoft Entra ID](access-with-azure-ad.md), see the provided links.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to a functional limitation on Microsoft Graph, [service principals](../../integrate/get-started/authentication/service-principal-managed-identity.md) don't appear in any list of Microsoft Entra group members on Azure DevOps. Permissions set on any Microsoft Entra groups still apply to any service principals in the group that have been added to the organizations, even if they aren't displaying on the web UI.

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |

|**Permissions**| - Member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.<br>- Microsoft Entra Administrator in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).|
