      - question: |
          Why do I need to sign in?
        answer: |
          Your Visual Studio settings, 
          like automatic brace completion, 
          are saved with your profile. 
          These settings roam with your [personal Microsoft account](https://www.microsoft.com/account), 
          or your [work or school account](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/sign-up-organization), 
          when you sign in to Visual Studio on any computer. 
          
          Sign in to Visual Studio during the 30-day 
          trial period for these benefits:
          
          *    Visual Studio Enterprise: Extend your trial for 90 days. When your trial expires, 
          learn [how to unlock Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-unlock-visual-studio).
          *    Visual Studio Express or Community: Continue to use this edition for free.
          
          When you create your profile, you can also create an organization.

          3.    Add your organization ({yourorganization}.visualstudio.com).
          4.    Select your project and prepare connection.
          
          If you get connection errors, try choosing HTTPS as your protocol.
