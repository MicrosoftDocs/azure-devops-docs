# Rename your organization in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

You can change your organization name (URL) at any time in Azure DevOps.

> [!Caution]
> The rename operation affects your organization's connections and individuals who are currently working with your organization. Before you start, find out [what to do before and after renaming your organization](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2793597).

> [!NOTE]
> An organization can't be renamed within one hour of the most recent rename operation.

To change your organization URL, you need at least Basic access and organization owner permissions.
