> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users and groups that inherit membership and permissions from an Azure AD group, no longer inherit those permissions after the transfer. Azure AD groups that were added to your Azure DevOps organization don't get transferred and cease to exist in your organization when you change the Azure AD connection. All permissions and membership relationships made with these Azure AD groups also cease to exist after the transfer. Also, note that [group rules](../assign-access-levels-by-group-membership.md) that were enabled on Azure AD groups cease to exist when you change the Azure AD connection.
