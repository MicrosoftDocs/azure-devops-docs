# Troubleshoot managing group-based licensing

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

#### Q: Will my users lose their access level and project membership if I remove a group rule?

A: Users in the group **TestGroup** lose access to group resources if the users haven't been explicitly assigned to the resources or assigned via a different group rule.

#### Q: Will my Azure DevOps or Azure AD group be deleted if I remove its group rule?

A: No. Your groups won't be deleted.

#### Q: What does the option "Remove <group> from all project level groups" do?

A: This option removes the Azure DevOps or Azure AD group from any project-level default groups, such as **Project Readers** or **Project Contributors**.
