# VSTS: Access with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups

**VSTS**

Do you want an easier way to control who can access your team's 
critical resources and key business assets in VSTS? 
If you already use Microsoft services like Office 365 or 
[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/azure-active-directory/), 
you can use the same identities with your VSTS organization. 
[Azure AD works with your VSTS organization](access-with-azure-ad.md) 
to control access and authenticate users through your Azure Active Directory. 

When you organize directory members with 
[Azure AD groups](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-manage-groups), 
you can reuse those groups to manage permissions 
in bulk for your VSTS organization. 
Just add those groups to the VSTS group that you want. 
For example, add them to built-in groups like 
Project Collection Administrators or Contributors, 
or manually-created groups like your project management team. 
Azure AD group members will inherit permissions from the VSTS group,
so you don't have to manage group members one at a time.

Not familiar with Azure AD, 
but want to check it out? Learn more about 
[Azure AD benefits](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis)
and differences in how you 
[control VSTS organization access with Microsoft accounts or with Azure AD](access-with-azure-ad.md).


## Before you start

* Your VSTS organization must be connected 
to your Azure Active Directory. 
[My organization uses Microsoft accounts only. Can I switch to Azure AD?](faq-azure-access.md#ChangeMSA)
* You must be a VSTS project administrator, 
project collection administrator, or organization owner. 
You must also have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder.
* To create and manage Azure AD groups, 
you must have Azure AD administrator permissions 
or have the directory administrator delegate those permissions to you in the 
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
* Be aware that Azure AD changes may take up to 24 hours for VSTS to see the changes.


##	Add an Azure AD group to a VSTS group

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../work/_shared/new-agile-hubs-feature.md)]

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

    You [invite guests into your Azure AD](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2017/05/11/inviting-directory-guests-to-aad-backed-vsts-accounts) 
    and into your Azure AD backed VSTS organizations, without waiting for them 
    to accept, which in turn allows you 
    to add those guests to your organization, grant access to projects, assign extensions, etc.

5.	Add more users or groups, or save your changes if you're done.

# [Previous navigation](#tab/prev-nav)

1.	Sign in to your VSTS organization (```https://{yourorganization}.visualstudio.com```).
