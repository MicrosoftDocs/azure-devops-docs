# Change your organization image

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

When you [create an organization](create-organization.md) in Azure DevOps, the system automatically generates a profile image. You can replace the default image with one that better represents your organization.

> [!NOTE]
> The max image size allowed is 2560 x 1024 px, and then we resize to 200 x 200.
