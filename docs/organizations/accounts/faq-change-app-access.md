#### Q: How do personal access tokens differ from alternate authentication credentials?

A:  Personal access tokens are a more convenient and secure replacement for alternate authentication credentials. You can limit a token's use to a specific lifetime, to an organization, and to [scopes](../../integrate/index.md) of activities that the token authorizes. Learn more about [personal access tokens](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md).

#### Q: If I deny access to one authentication method in one organization, does that affect all the organizations that I own?

A:  No, you can still use that method in all the other organizations that you own. [Personal access tokens](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) apply to specific organizations or to all organizations, based on your selection when you created the token.

#### Q:  If I deny access to an authentication method, then allow access again, will the apps that need access continue to work?

A:  Yes, those apps continue to work.

#### Q:  What apps integrate with Azure DevOps?

A:  Find the [apps that integrate with Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops).
