# Remove direct assignments from users in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

To manage a user's resources only by the groups that they're in, you must remove the direct assignments. Resources that are directly assigned to a user via individual assignment stay assigned to the user, whether the resources are assigned or taken away from the user's groups.

## Prerequisites

* You must be a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group for the organization that you would like to manage users' direct assignments.

## Remove assignments

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation-cloud.md)] 

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../../_img/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

   ![Open Organization settings](../../_shared/_img/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)

3. Select the **Users** tab.
