# Add more users to Azure DevOps with Basic features or Visual Studio subscriptions

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Learn how to pay for additional users if you have more than five users who need Basic features and assign Visual Studio subscriptions. When your organization stays within the free limits, you don't have to pay for users to join. You pay only if you have more than five users who need Basic features and don't have Visual Studio subscriptions.

## Add users

1. [Pay for additional users in the Visual Studio Marketplace](../billing/buy-basic-access-add-users.md), Azure DevOps tab.
2. Return to your organization in Azure DevOps.
3. [Add the users](add-organization-users.md) and assign them Basic access.

You pay monthly for their access and can cancel the access at any time.

Visual Studio subscriptions give you flexible ways to access Azure DevOps and to license the Visual Studio IDE and other Microsoft software for development and test. Learn [how to buy Visual Studio subscriptions](/visualstudio/subscriptions/vscloud-overview).
