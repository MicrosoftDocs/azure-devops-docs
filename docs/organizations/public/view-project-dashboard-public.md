# View project homepage or a dashboard 

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)]  

The project homepage typically provides information about the project, and dashboards provide charts, links, or focused information for a team or project.   

If you're a contributor, you can also [edit README files for a project](../../project/wiki/project-vision-status.md) and [add and edit dashboards](../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md).  

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/anon-user.md)]   

## Open the project home page

From your web browser, open the public project.   

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)] 


# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

To open the project home page, choose **Summary** from the sidebar.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open the Project Home Page, anonymous user](_img/project-page-vert-brn.png) 

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

To open the project home page, choose the project listed in the top navigation bar.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open the Project Home Page, anonymous user](_img/project-page-anon.png)

You're invited to clone the project's main Git repository to your computer. To learn more about cloning, see [Clone a Git repository](clone-git-repo-public.md).

> [!NOTE]   
> You can clone a Git repository via HTTPS, however not with SSH and GVFS endpoints. Clients like Visual Studio and IntelliJ work with the HTTPS clone URL.


## View dashboards

To view a dashboard, choose **Dashboards**. You'll see the set of dashboards defined for the default team. Choose one of the dashboards to open it. 

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open Dashboards, anonymous user](_img/open-dashboards-vert.png) 

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open Dashboards, anonymous user](_img/dashboard-view.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open Dashboards, anonymous user](_img/unavailable-widget-image.png)

The following dashboard widgets are't available to anonymous users:

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/unavailable-widgets.md)]
