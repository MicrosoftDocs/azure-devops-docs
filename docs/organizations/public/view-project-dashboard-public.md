# View project homepage or a dashboard

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/version-public-projects.md)]  

Learn how to view the project homepage, which typically provides information about the project, and dashboards, which provide charts, links, or focused information for a team or project.

If you're a contributor, you can also [edit README files for a project](../projects/project-vision-status.md) and [add and edit dashboards](../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md).  

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/anon-user.md)]

## Open the project home page

From your web browser, open the public project.

To open the project home page, choose **Summary** from the sidebar.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open the Project Home Page, anonymous user](media/project-page-vert-brn.png)

You're invited to clone the project's main Git repository to your computer. To learn more about cloning, see [Clone a Git repository](clone-git-repo-public.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can clone a Git repository via HTTPS, however not with SSH and GVFS endpoints. Clients like Visual Studio and IntelliJ work with the HTTPS clone URL.

## View dashboards

To view a dashboard, choose **Dashboards**. You see the set of dashboards defined for the default team. Choose one of the dashboards to open it.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Unavailable dashboard widget.](media/unavailable-widget-image.png)

The following dashboard widgets aren't available to anonymous users:
