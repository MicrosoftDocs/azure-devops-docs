# Search the code base of a public project

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)]  

With code search, you can locate specific types of code and easily narrow or widen your search.


<a name="start-search"></a>
## Initiate a search 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation-cloud.md)] 

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

To start your search, choose **Repos>Files** or other page under **Repos**, enter a keyword or phrase in the search box, and press *Enter* or choose the ![start search icon](../../project/search/_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) start search icon. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Code Search box, new navigation](_img/search/code-search-vert.png)    

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)  

0. In the search box, check that the text displays _Search code_. If it doesn't, use the selector to select it.

   ![Switching between searching for code and work items](../../project/search/_img/code-search-get-started/title-bar-search-box-empty-outlined.png)

0. Enter a search string in the text box, and press _Enter_ (or choose the 
   ![start search icon](../../project/search/_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) icon) to start your search.

## View and work with search results  

1. The search page shows a list of the matching code files. The selected file has all
   instances of the search string highlighted. If you see a list of work items, ensure that **Code** is selected in the top left.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Code search results example](_img/search/code-search-example.png) 

1. Try assembling more complex search strings using the operators and functions listed in the handy 
   drop-down list. Select the filter function or code type you want to include in your search string from the
   list, and enter the criteria value.

	> ![Search from the title bar](_img/search/code-search-filters.png)     

   * You can find all instances of "ToDo" comments in your code simply by selecting `comment:` and typing `todo`. 

   * You can search in specific locations, such as within a particular path, by using a search string such as `Driver path:MyShuttle/Server`. 

   * You can search for files by name, such as `Driver file:GreenCabs.cs`, or just by file extension. For example, the search string 
    `error ext:resx` could be useful when you want to review all error strings in your code. 
    But even if your plain text search string (without specific file type functions) 
    matches part of a filename, the file appears in the list of found files.

   * You can combine two or more words by using Boolean operators; for example, `validate OR release`.

   * You can find an exact match to a set of words by enclosing your search terms in double-quotes. For example, `"Client not found"`. 

   * You can use the code type search functions with files written in C#, C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic.NET.



## Fine tune your search

1. Narrow your search to a specific repo, branch, file path, or code type by selecting from the drop-down lists at the top of the page.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Use drop-down lists to narrow your search](_img/search/code-search-code-types.png)   

1. Use the tabs in the results page to view the **History** of the file or to **Compare** versions of the file. Choose **Blame** to view the last commit, person, and date to modify the file.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Use tabs to view history and compare files](_img/search/code-search-contents-history-views.png)   	 

   > Open the search results in a new browser tab from either search box by
   pressing _Ctrl_ + _Enter_ or by holding _Ctrl_ and clicking  the
   ![start search icon](../../project/search/_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) icon.
   In Google Chrome, press _Ctrl_ + _Shift_ + _Enter_ to switch the focus
   to the new browser tab.

1. Choose the filename link at the top of this column to open the file in a new Code Explorer window.

	> ![Open the file in Code Explorer](_img/search/code-search-open-file.png)
