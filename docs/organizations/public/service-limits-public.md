## Custom work tracking 

You can customize work tracking objects subject to the limits summarized in the following table. You define these objects through an inheritance process. To learn more, see [Customize a project using an inherited process](../settings/work/customize-process.md).

## Wiki

Wikis defined for a project are limited to 1 GB per git repository. 

> [!TIP]    
> To derive the size of a wiki/git repository, download the repo to your local computer, unzip the file, and then open the **Properties** for the corresponding folder.
