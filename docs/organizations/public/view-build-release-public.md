# View build and release pipelines

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)]  

When viewing a public project, you can view the status of build and release pipelines. If you're a contributor, you can also [define build pipelines](../../pipelines/build/ci-public.md?toc=/azure/devops/organizations/public/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/organizations/public/breadcrumb/toc.json).  

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/anon-user.md)]
