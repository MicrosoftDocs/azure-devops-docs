# Quickstart: Invite users to contribute to your public project

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)]  

In this quickstart, you learn how to enable users to contribute to your project.

## Prerequisites

Add the user as a member of your organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you add a member, review the notes provided in [private-to-public migration checklist](migration-checklist.md) as well as
> the [additional cross-project resources](../accounts/resources-granted-to-project-members.md) this grants.

## Open Organization Settings > Users

1. From your web browser, sign-in to Azure DevOps. You must be signed in to create a public project.

2. Choose the ![](../../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to open **Projects**. Then choose **Admin settings**.

	> ![Open Organization settings](../../_shared/_img/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)  

3. Then, choose **Users** to open **Manage users**. Choose **Add new users** to open the dialog.

## Add user accounts to a project

1. Fill out the form based on the guidance provided.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Invite new users](_img/invite-users/add-new-user-form.png)

	- **Users**: Enter the email address for the user account. You can add several email addresses by separating them with a semicolon (;). Note that for Microsoft accounts (MSAs), the email addresses display in red.
	- **Access level**: You can add up to 5 users (total including your own user account) with *Basic* access. Otherwise, you can add an unlimited number of users with *Stakeholder* access. In public projects, both the Stakeholder and the Basic access level grant full access to **Code**, **Work**, and **Build and Release**, but Stakeholders only get partial access to **Test** and **Dashboards**.  To learn more, see [Default roles & access for public projects](default-roles-access-public.md).
	- **Add to projects**: Select the public project that you created, or select **Add All** to add the user to all projects defined for the organization.  
	- **Azure DevOps Groups**: Leave this entry at Project Contributors, the default security group for people who contribute to your project. To learn more, see [Default permissions and access assignments](../security/permissions-access.md).

2. When you're done, choose **Add** to complete your invitation.
