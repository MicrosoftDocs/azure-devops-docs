## Add user accounts to a project

0. Fill out the form based on the guidance provided.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Invite new users](_img/invite-users/add-new-user-form.png)

	- **Users**: Enter the email address for the user account. You can add several email addresses by separating them with a semicolon (;). Note that for Microsoft accounts (MSAs), the email addresses display in red.
	- **Access level**: You can add up to 5 users (total including your own user account) with *Basic* access. Otherwise, you can add an unlimited number of users with *Stakeholder* access. In public projects, both the Stakeholder and the Basic access level grant full access to **Code**, **Work**, and **Build and Release**, but Stakeholders only get partial access to **Test** and **Dashboards**.  To learn more, see [Default roles & access for public projects](default-roles-access-public.md).
	- **Add to projects**: Select the public project that you created, or select **Add All** to add the user to all projects defined for the organization.  
	- **Azure DevOps Groups**: Leave this entry at Project Contributors, the default security group for people who will contribute to your project. To learn more, see [Default permissions and access assignments](../security/permissions-access.md).

5. When done, choose **Add** to complete your invitation.
