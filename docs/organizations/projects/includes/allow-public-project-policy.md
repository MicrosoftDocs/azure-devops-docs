> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only organizations with the **Allow public project policy** already enabled can create projects or change the visibility of a project to public. The policy is no longer available to organizations that aren't using it already. Microsoft recommends using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for all your public project needs.
