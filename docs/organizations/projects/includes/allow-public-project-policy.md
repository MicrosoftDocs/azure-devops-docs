> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only organizations with the [Allow public project policy already enabled](#step-1-enable-public-projects-for-your-organization) can create projects or change the visibility of a project to public. The policy is no longer available to organizations that aren't using it already. Microsoft recommends using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for all your public project needs.
