# Create a project in Azure DevOps and TFS

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Create a project to establish a repository for source code, where a group of developers and teams can plan, track progress, and collaborate on building software solutions. Each project you create provides boundaries to isolate data from other projects and must be managed and structured to support your business needs. To learn more about projects and when or when not to create one, see [About projects and scaling your organization](about-projects.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This article is about creating a project in Azure DevOps or a Team Foundation Server. If instead you want to create Azure DevOps Projects, see [Azure DevOps Projects](/azure/devops-project/).

<!---Projects differ from [software application projects or solutions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/zfzh36t7.aspx). -->  

If you have a project already, and want to start coding an application project, then see one of the following topics:  [Set up Git on your dev machine](../../repos/git/gitquickstart.md) or [Develop your app in Team Foundation version control](../../repos/git/gitquickstart.md).

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"
> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to manage an on-premises server, you can
[sign up for Azure DevOps Services and create a project](../accounts/create-organization.md).

## Create a project from the web portal

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

To create a project, you must first have [created an organization in Azure DevOps](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To create a Public project, or to make a private project public, see [Create a public project](../public/create-public-project.md) or [Change the project visibility, public or private](../public/make-project-public.md). Additional policy settings must be enabled to work with public projects.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you create a project from the web portal, several process template files are ignored. Specifically, the files that would create a Report Manager site aren't supported. If you want SQL Server Reporting Services  to be to be available, then create your project from Visual Studio or Team Explorer. For details, see [Process template and plug-in files, Client support for project creation](../../reference/process-templates/overview-process-template-files.md#client-support).

   See [choosing the right version control for your project](../../repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc.md) and [choose a process](../../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md) for guidance.  

3. When your project has been created, the welcome page appears.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Project creation confirmation dialog, new nav](_img/create-project/project-creation-complete-new-nav.png)

   Select one of the following tasks to get started:
   - **Invite** to begin [adding others to your project](../security/add-users-team-project.md). Note, you can only invite users who have already been [added to your organization](../accounts/add-team-members.md).
   - **Boards** to begin [adding work items](../../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md).
   - **Repos** to open [Repos>Files](../../repos/git/clone.md) page where you can clone or import a repository, or initialize a README file for your project summary page.
   - **Pipelines** to start [defining a pipeline](../../pipelines/index.md).
   - **Test Plans** to start [defining test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).
   - [Manage your services](../settings/set-services.md) to disable the visibility of one or more services.

If you're using TFS 2015.2 or later version, then you can create a project from the web as well. It's important to note that for projects created from the web, Reporting and SharePoint integration steps are skipped when creating the project. You can still set up [Reporting](../../report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project.md) and [SharePoint](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-sharepoint-to-tfs) manually after project creation.

## Create a project in Team Explorer

You can create a project from Team Explorer after you have connected to an on-premises server.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"  

> [!NOTE]
> For TFS 2018 and later versions, users are redirected to the web. They no longer are able to create a project from Visual Studio.
>
> TFS 2018 and later versions no longer support native integration with SharePoint products. If you're planning to upgrade to TFS 2018, read [About SharePoint integration](../../report/sharepoint-dashboards/about-sharepoint-integration.md) to learn about the options available to you.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"

1. If you're not a member of the Project Collection Administrators Group, [get added as one](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). To create projects you must have the **Create new projects** permission set to **Allow**.

2. Ask your TFS administrator about the following resources and get additional permissions as needed:

    - Which project collection should you connect to when you create your project? If you installed TFS using the Basic Server Configuration Wizard, you have only one project collection named **DefaultCollection**. Unless you are supporting hundreds of projects, you should create all your projects within a single project collection. If you need to create additional collections, see [Manage project collections](/azure/devops/server/admin/manage-team-project-collections).

    - Has SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services been configured for the deployment? If so, ask your administrator to [add you as a member of the Team Foundation Content Managers group](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md) on the server that hosts SQL Server Reporting Services. Without these permissions, you are unable to create a project.

    - Has a SharePoint Web application been configured for your deployment? If you want to configure a SharePoint portal when you create your project, ask the SharePoint administrator to give you Full Control permissions on the server that hosts SharePoint Products. Otherwise, you can skip this step and configure a portal at a later time.

3. Open the same version of Visual Studio as the version of TFS that you're connecting to. If you don't see the Team Explorer pane, open **View\>Team Explorer** from the menu.

    As needed, [Download and install Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) to get a free copy of the latest version.

4. Connect to the server and project collection where you want to create your project.

    ![ALM\_CTP\_Connect](_img/IC827208.png)

    You can access Team Explorer for free by installing [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) or any other Visual Studio version.

    You must connect from a client that is at the same version level as TFS. That is, you must connect to TFS 2015 from a version of Visual Studio 2015.

    ![ALM\_EXL\_Connect](_img/IC680074.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > If you are running Team Explorer from a server that hosts SharePoint Products and SQL Server Reporting Services, you might need to run Visual Studio as an administrator.

5. If it's your first time connecting to TFS, you need to add TFS to the list of recognized servers.

    ![ALM\_EXL\_AddServer](_img/IC658167.png)

6. Open the New Project Wizard.

    ![New link on Connect page (Team Explorer)](_img/IC779380.png)

7. Name the project. Don't specify more than 64 characters.

    ![ALM\_CTP\_NameProject](_img/IC671598.png)

8. Choose a process template. For a comparison of the default process templates, see [Choose a process](../../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).

    ![ALM\_CTP\_SelectTemplate](_img/IC795955.png)

9. Choose your version control, either Git distributed repositories or TFVC, one centralized repository.

    ![ALM\_CTP\_SelectSource](_img/IC671600.png)

    Not sure which system to use? Learn more about 
    [Git](../../repos/git/overview.md) or [TFVC](../../repos/tfvc/overview.md).

    After you've created your project, you can [add repositories](#add-a-repository).

10. Unless your project collection is configured to support a SharePoint project portal, you're done.

    ![ALM\_CTP\_Finish](_img/IC795956.png)

    If the Next button is active, you can configure your project portal.

    If the wizard encounters a problem, you receive an error message and a link to the project creation log. Review the [log file](faq-create-project.md#log-file) for specific errors and exceptions.

11. When you're finished, you can see your project in Team Explorer. You can also choose the **Web Access** link to connect to your project from the web portal.

## Create a project from the command line or scripts

You can create and retrieve projects and other objects from the command line or scripts using the CLI. Check out the [CLI documentation](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/?view=azure-cli-latest) to learn more.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"
> [!NOTE]
> The CLI is supported for TFS 2017.2 and later versions.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"

## Add a repository

From the admin context of the web portal, you can add additional repositories to a project, either Git (distributed) or TFVC (centralized). While you can create many Git repositories, you can only create a single TFVC repository for a project.  Additional steps to address permissions may be required. See [Use Git and TFVC repos in the same project](../../repos/git/team-projects.md).
