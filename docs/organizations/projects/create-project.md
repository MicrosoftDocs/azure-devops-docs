# Create a project in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Create an Azure DevOps project to establish a repository for source code and to plan and track work. You can manage and structure your project to support your business needs. Each project provides boundaries to isolate data from other projects. For more information, see [About projects and scaling your organization](about-projects.md).

[!INCLUDE [version-selector](../../includes/version-selector-minimize.md)]

If you don't want to create a project in Azure DevOps, you can create [Azure DevOps Projects](/azure/devops-project/).

<!---Projects differ from [software application projects or solutions](/visualstudio/ide/creating-solutions-and-projects). -->  

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to manage an on-premises server, [sign up for Azure DevOps Services](../accounts/create-organization.md) and create a project.
::: moniker-end

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

- You need an organization before you can create a project. If you haven't created an organization yet, create one by following the instructions in [Sign up, sign in to Azure DevOps](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md), which also creates a project. Or see [Create an organization or project collection](../accounts/create-organization.md).  
- You must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators group or have the collection-level "Create new projects" permission set to *Allow*. If you're the Organization owner, you're automatically added to the Project Collection Administrators group. For more information, see [Change project collection-level permissions](../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md).
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=" < azure-devops"  

- You need a project collection before you can create a project. If you don't have one, [create a project collection now](/azure/devops/server/admin/manage-project-collections?view=azure-devops-2020#create-a-project-collection&preserve-view=true).
- You must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators group or have the "Create new projects permission" set to *Allow*. For more information, see [Change project collection-level permissions](../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md).

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To create a public project or to make a private project public, see [Create a public project in your organization](../public/create-public-project.md) or [Change the project visibility, public or private](../public/make-project-public.md). You must enable additional policy settings to work with public projects.

::: moniker-end

## Create a project

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can create up to 1000 projects within an organization in Azure DevOps. For more information, see [Work tracking, process, and project limits](../settings/work/object-limits.md). 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=" < azure-devops"

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you create a project from the web portal, Azure DevOps ignores several process template files. Specifically, the files that would create a Report Manager site aren't supported. You can add reports later by following the instructions provided in [Add reports to a teams project](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project). 

There isn't a limit on the number of projects that you can create within a project collection, however for performance purposes, we recommend you limit the number to 300 or fewer. For more information, see [Work tracking, process, and project limits](../settings/work/object-limits.md).

## Add a repository to your project

You can add Git (distributed) or TFVC (centralized) repositories to your project. You can create many Git repositories, but only a single TFVC repository for a project. More steps to address permissions may be required. For more information, see [Use Git and TFVC repos in the same project](../../repos/git/team-projects.md).

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### Q: How do I resolve permission-related errors?

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
A: If you receive an error message that states you don't have permission to create a project, you need to request organization-level permissions. See [Change permissions at the organization- or collection-level](../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md).  
::: moniker-end
          
::: moniker range=" < azure-devops"
A: If you receive an error message that states you don't have permission to create a project, you need to request collection-level permissions. See [Change permissions at the organization or collection-level](../security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md). If you have SQL Reporting Services installed in the collection, you also need permissions for reports to the [Team Foundation Content Managers group](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports).  
::: moniker-end
          
### Q: How do I resolve Error TF30321? 

A: **Error TF30321: The name you entered is already used for another project on the Team Foundation Server** indicates that you should use a different name for your project. The name you entered is either in active use or has undergone partial deletion, but not full deletion.  
          
Even when you've deleted a project, you may get the same name error. Some components could be created or deleted even though others aren't. In this event, you can't reuse the name associated with the project.
          
::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

To verify project deletion or remove remaining components associated with a partially deleted project, use the [Delete project command line tool(TFSDeleteProject)](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfsdeleteproject-cmd). Then try again to create the project with the same name.
          
Even with troubleshooting, you might not be able to use the same name. Some components of the deleted project could be scheduled for deletion but not yet deleted.

### Q: How do I resolve an error message related to a plug-in?

A: The process template used to create the project contains several XML plug-in files. If one of these files contains a format or other error, an error message appears.

Review the project creation log to determine the plug-in that caused the error. After you discover the problem, you can either contact the developer or vendor that provided the plug-in, or attempt to fix the problem yourself. For more information, see [Customize a process template](../../reference/process-templates/customize-process.md).

### Q: How do I resolve a problem connecting to a server?

A: If you receive an error message about a problem connecting to a server, retrieving information from a server, or checking permissions to create projects, an incorrectly configured server in the deployment could have caused it. This problem is especially common after a server move, failover, or other maintenance activity.
          
Contact the TFS system administrator and request that they verify the server configuration.
          
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
### Q: How do I add my custom process template to the list?
A: [Upload your template](../../boards/work-items/guidance/manage-process-templates.md) using the Process Template Manager. For more information, see [Customize process](../../reference/process-templates/customize-process.md).
          
<a id="log-file">  </a>

### Q: Where is the log file located?

A: The log file is stored in $:\\Users\\*user name*\\AppData\\Local\\Temp and labeled vso\_TeamProjectCreation\_*yyyy\_mm\_dd\_hh\_mm\_ss*.log.
          
The log shows each action taken by the wizard at the time of the failure and may include more details about the error. You can review the log entries to find network or file related issues by searching for **Exception** or **Error**.
                 
### Q: How do I add SQL Server Reporting services?

A: See [Add reports to a project](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project).
