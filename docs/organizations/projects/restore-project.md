# Restore a project

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Sometimes we might delete a project in Azure DevOps by mistake. You can restore a deleted project up to 28 days after it was deleted. This article shows you how.

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

* You must be a member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md). Organization owners are automatically members of this group.

* You must also have the "delete project" permission set to **Allow**. To learn how to check your permissions, see [View permissions](../security/view-permissions.md).

### Using REST API

> [!WARNING]
> If you're trying to restore a project with a name that's already taken, you need to rename the project before it can be restored. To rename the project, enter the following in the request body: `"name":"new name"`

1. Open a browser window and enter a URL that uses the following form:  

    'http://ServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/ProjectName'

   For example, to connect to the server named **FabrikamPrime**, enter: 'http://FabrikamPrime:8080/tfs/'.

   The default Port is 8080. Specify the port number and directory for your server if defaults aren't used.

2. Get a list of deleted projects using the following request:

   ```
   GET http://ServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/projects?stateFilter=
   deleted&api-version=5.0-preview.3
   ```

3. Restore a deleted project using the following request:

   ```
   PATCH http://ServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/projects/{projectId}?
   api-version=5.0-preview.3
   ```
   Request body

   ```   
   {
    "state" : "wellFormed"
   }
   ```

### Using PowerShell

1. Execute the following PowerShell script to get a list of deleted projects and make sure to update `$collectionUrl`.

   ```
   $collectionUrl = "https://localhost/defaultcollection"
   (irm -Uri "$collectionUrl/_apis/projects?stateFilter=
   deleted&api-version=5.0-preview.3" -UseDefaultCredentials).value
   ```

   Something similar to the following screenshot appears:
   ![PowerShell script return example for deleted projects](media/restore-project/deleted-projects-powershell-script-2019.png)

2. Use the following script to restore a project. Be sure to update `$collectionUrl` and `$projectName`.


   ```
   $collectionUrl = "https://localhost/defaultcollection"
   $projectName = 'Project1'
   $project = (irm -Uri "$collectionUrl/_apis/projects?stateFilter=
   deleted&api-version=5.0-preview.3" -UseDefaultCredentials).value
    | where {$_.name -eq $projectName}
   irm -Uri ($project.url + "?api-version=5.0-preview.3") 
   -UseDefaultCredentials -Method PATCH -Body '{"state":"wellFormed"}'
    -ContentType 'application/json'
   ```

Your project and associated data are restored.
