# Delete a project

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../../includes/version-all.md)]Â  

If you have a project that's no longer valid, you can delete it from your organization in Azure DevOps. This action also helps to simplify navigating to only those projects that are in use. 

> [!Caution]
> Projects get permanently deleted if not restored within 28 days. For more information on restoring projects, see [Restore a project](restore-project.md). If you want to access project data while the project is deleted (without [restoring it](restore-project.md)) you should [save project data](save-project-data.md).

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

- You must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators group or have the **Delete team project** permission set to **Allow**. If you're the Organization Owner, you're automatically added to the Project Collection Administrators group. If you aren't a member, get added now. For more information, see [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).

Your project is deleted and can be restored up to 28 days afterward. Your deleted project is removed from your projects list.

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli) 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

You can delete a team project with the [az devops project delete](/cli/azure/devops/project#ext-azure-devops-az-devops-project-delete) command. To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).

```azurecli 
az devops project delete --id
                         [--org]
                         [--yes] 
``` 

#### Parameters 

- **id**: Required. The ID of the project you want to delete. To determine the ID of a project, use the [az devops project list](/cli/azure/devops/project#ext-azure-devops-az-devops-project-list) command.
- **org**: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization using `az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`. Example: `--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.
- **yes**: Don't prompt for confirmation.

::: moniker-end
[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/note-cli-supported-server.md)]  
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

#### Example 

The following command deletes the team project with the specified ID without prompting you for confirmation.

```azurecli 
az devops project delete --id 9a61d475-b1a7-4da7-b9db-80df15ac985c --yes
```

## Delete a project 

Using the administration console, you can delete a project from a project collection. Afterwards, you'll need to manually delete any associated reports and SharePoint project portal. Or, you can use the [TFSDeleteProject command line tool](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfsdeleteproject-cmd) to delete all artifacts.

1. If you're not a member of one or more of the following administrator groups, [get permissions now](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator):

    - Team Foundation Administrators group (required).

    - SQL Server System Administrators group (required).

    - Farm Administrators group for SharePoint Products (required when your deployment uses SharePoint Products).

2. Open the administration console and delete the project from its project collection.

3. Choose whether to delete external data associated with the project and then start the delete action.

    ![delete projects dialog](media/delete-project/ic687180.png)

4. (Optional) To review the status of the delete action, open the **Status** tab.

    To review the details of the delete action, you can open the log file from either the **Status** tab or **Logs** tab.

## Delete reports that remain after deleting a project

If your project used reporting and you didn't delete external artifacts, you can delete the reports using SQL Server Report Manager. From the project collection page, delete the folder that corresponds to the deleted project.

## Remove the project portal

If your project had a project portal, all links to that portal get removed from TWA and Team Explorer. But, the SharePoint site or website that acted as the portal doesn't get deleted. If you want to delete the portal, you must do so manually after the project has been deleted. See [How to: Create, Edit, and Delete Windows SharePoint Services Sites](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/ms253110(v%3dvs.100)).

## FAQs

See the following frequently asked questions about deleting projects in Azure DevOps.

### Q: After deleting one project, why do work items in a remaining project still have links to the deleted project work items? 

A: Work items get deleted within 24 hours after your project is deleted.

### Q: I deleted a project in Azure DevOps, but in Visual Studio Team Explorer it's still there, what do I do?

A: Wait 28 days before the project is permanently deleted.

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

### Q: What if the delete action doesn't finish?

A: Review the status and log files for the delete action. Open the **Status** tab and for **Deleted**, review the additional information in parentheses, and take the indicated action.

- (**Processing**) means that the process has started and is in progress.

- (**Pending**) means that the deletion process has started from a client application. The deletion might be in progress or might have failed. Because the process was started from a client application, the server can't accurately report the status of the deletion.

    If a project deletion remains pending for a long time, try to delete the project again from the administration console.

- (**Failed**) means that the deletion process started but didn't successfully finish. The log file contains specific information about the failure.

    Review the information about the failure, and then try to delete the project again.

    If partial data remains, you can also use the [TFSDeleteProject](/azure/devops/server/command-line/tfsdeleteproject-cmd) command-line tool.
