# Quickstart: Connect to a project in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

In this quickstart, you learn how to connect to a project in order to share code, build apps, track work, and collaborate with team members, from one of the following clients:
  
- [Web portal](#web-portal)  
- [Visual Studio or Team Explorer](#visual-studio)  
- [Eclipse/Team Explorer Everywhere](../../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-eclipse.md)
- [Android Studio with the Azure DevOps Services Plugin for Android Studio](../../java/download-android-studio-plug-in.md)  
- [IntelliJ with the Azure DevOps Services Plugin for IntelliJ](../../java/download-intellij-plug-in.md) 
- [Visual Studio Code](../../java/vscode-extension.md)    

A project defines a process and data storage in which you manage your software projects from planning to deployment. When you connect to a project, you connect to an organization or project collection. Within that collection, one or more projects may be defined. At a minimum, at least one project must be created in order to use the system. For more information, see [About projects and scaling your organization](about-projects.md).

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have a project yet, [create one](create-project.md). If you need to add a team, see [Add teams](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md). If you don't have access to the project, [get invited to the team](../security/add-users-team-project.md). 

- From each of these clients, you can quickly switch context to a different project and connect under a different sign-in user name. If you work remotely, configure your client to [connect to a TFS Proxy server](#proxy).

- To get started with a code base, [set up Git](../../repos/git/gitquickstart.md) or [set up TFVC](../../repos/tfvc/overview.md).

<a id="web-portal">  </a>

## Connect from the web portal

1. If you're not a member of a security group, ask your project administrator to add you.  

2. Open a browser window and enter a URL that uses the following form:  

   ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
   <pre><code>https://dev.azure.com/<i>OrganizationName</i>/<i>ProjectName</i> </code></pre>
   ::: moniker-end

   ::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= azure-devops-2019" 
   <pre><code>http://<i>ServerName</i>:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/<i>ProjectName</i></code></pre> 

   For example, to connect to the server named **FabrikamPrime**, type: **http://FabrikamPrime:8080/tfs/**.

   The default Port is 8080. Specify the port number and directory for your server if defaults aren't used.
   ::: moniker-end

3. When you access the server for the first time, a Windows Identity dialog box appears. Fill in your credentials and choose the **OK** button.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you select the **Remember me** check box you won't have to enter your credentials the next time you connect. 

4. Choose your project, team, or page of interest.

    ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

    From the project summary page, hover over a service and then choose the desired page. To choose another project, choose the ![Azure DevOps logo](../../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose a service page, horizontal nav](_img/connect-projects/project-summary-page-choose-app-vert.png)  

    ::: moniker-end
 
    ::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <=tfs-2018"

    From the project summary page, hover over a service and then choose the desired page. To choose another project, choose the ![Azure DevOps logo](../../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose a service page, horizontal nav](_img/connect-projects/project-summary-page-choose-app-horz.png)  

    ::: moniker-end

    ::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2015"

    Choose your project or team from the set of available links, or choose Browse to access all projects and teams.

---
 
To run Visual Studio under sign-in credentials that are different from your signed-in Windows account, open the context menu for **devenv.exe** to access your run as options. If you don't see the **run as** option as shown in the following example, you may need to press SHIFT before right-clicking to see the run as options.

![Context menu for Visual Studio devenv.exe](_img/connect-projects-tfs/IC719959.png)

You can locate the executable in the following folder: `*Drive*:\\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio xx.0\Common7\IDE\`

### User accounts and licensing for Visual Studio

To connect to a project, you need your user account added to the project. This is typically done by the [organization owner (Azure DevOps Services)](../accounts/add-organization-users.md) or a [project administrator](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
Azure DevOps Services provides access to the first 5 account users free. After that, you need to [pay for more users](../../billing/buy-basic-access-add-users.md). 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"

For on-premises TFS, each user account must have a TFS client access license (CAL). All Visual Studio subscriptions and paid Azure DevOps Services users include a TFS CAL. Find out more about licensing from the [Team Foundation Server pricing page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/tfs-pricing).

::: moniker-end

In addition, you can provide access to Stakeholders in your organization who have limited access to select features as described in [Work as a Stakeholder](../security/get-started-stakeholder.md).

<a name="proxy"></a>

## Configure Visual Studio to connect to TFS Proxy

If your remote team uses a [TFS Proxy server](/azure/devops/server/install/install-proxy-setup-remote) to cache files, you can configure Visual Studio to connect through that proxy server and download files under Team Foundation version control.

1.  First, make sure that you have connected to TFS as described [in the previous section](#visual-studio).

2.  From the Visual Studio **Tools** menu, open the Options dialog and expand the Source Control folder. On the Plug-in Selection page, confirm that Visual Studio Team Foundation Server is selected.

    ![Plug-in Selection page, Options dialog box](_img/connect-projects-tfs/IC719960.png)

3.  On the Visual Studio Team Foundation Server page, enter the name and port number for the TFS Proxy server. Select the **Use SSL encryption (https) to connect** checkbox.

    ![VS TFVC proxy configuration page, Options dialog](_img/connect-projects-tfs/IC719961.png)

    Make sure you specify the port number that your administrator assigned to TFS Proxy.

To **Configure User Tools** to associate a file type with a compare or merge tool, see [Associate a file type with a file-comparison tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-file-comparison-tool.md) or [Associate a file type with a merge tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-merge-tool.md).


### What other clients support connection to Azure DevOps?

In addition to connecting through a web browser, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Excel, and Project you can connect to a  project from these clients: 

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs)
- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) 
- [Eclipse: Team Explorer Everywhere](/azure/devops/java/download-eclipse-plug-in) 
- [Azure Test Plans](../../test/mtm/guidance-mtm-usage.md) (formerly Test Manager)
- [Microsoft Feedback Client](../../project/feedback/give-feedback.md) 

### Requirements and client compatibility

Some tasks or features aren't available when you connect to a later version of Azure DevOps Server than which your client supports. For more information, see [Client compatibility](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).

### Determine your platform version
