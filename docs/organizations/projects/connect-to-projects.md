# Connect to a project in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Learn how to connect to a project to share code, build apps, track work, and collaborate with team members. You can use any of the following clients:
  
- [Web portal](#web-portal)  
- [Visual Studio or Team Explorer](#visual-studio)  
- [Eclipse/Team Explorer Everywhere](../../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-eclipse.md)
- [Android Studio with the Azure DevOps Services Plugin for Android Studio](/previous-versions/azure/devops/all/java/download-android-studio-plug-in)  
- [IntelliJ with the Azure DevOps Services Plugin for IntelliJ](/previous-versions/azure/devops/all/java/download-intellij-plug-in) 
- [Visual Studio Code](/previous-versions/azure/devops/all/java/vscode-extension)

A project defines a process and data storage in which you manage your software projects from planning to deployment. When you connect to a project, you connect to an organization or project collection. One or more projects may be defined within a collection. There must be at least one project. For more information, see [About projects and scaling your organization](about-projects.md).

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have a project yet, [create one](create-project.md).

- If you need to add a team, see [Add teams](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md). If you don't have access to the project, [get invited to the team](../security/add-users-team-project.md).

- From each of these clients, you can switch context to a different project and connect as a different user. If you work remotely, configure your client to [connect to an Azure DevOps Proxy Server](#proxy).

- To get started with a code base, [set up Git](../../repos/git/gitquickstart.md) or [set up TFVC](../../repos/tfvc/index.yml).

<a id="web-portal">  </a>

## Connect from the web portal

1. If you're not a member of a security group, ask your Project Administrator to add you.  

1. Open a browser and enter a URL that uses the following form:  

   ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
   <pre><code>https://dev.azure.com/<i>OrganizationName</i>/<i>ProjectName</i> </code></pre>
   ::: moniker-end

   ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops" 
   <pre><code>http://<i>ServerName</i>/DefaultCollection/<i>ProjectName</i></code></pre> 

   For example, to connect to the server named **FabrikamPrime**, type: **http://FabrikamPrime/DefaultCollection**.
   ::: moniker-end
   ::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"  
   <pre><code>http://<i>ServerName</i>:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/<i>ProjectName</i></code></pre> 

   For example, to connect to the server named **FabrikamPrime**, type: **http://FabrikamPrime:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection**.

   The default Port is 8080. If you don't use default values, specify the port number and directory for your server.
   ::: moniker-end

1. When you access the server for the first time, a Windows Identity dialog box appears. Enter your credentials and choose **OK**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If you select **Remember me**, you won't have to enter your credentials the next time you connect.

1. Choose your project, team, or page of interest.

    ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

    From the project summary page, hover over a service and then choose the page you want. To choose another project, choose **Azure DevOps**. ![Azure DevOps logo](../../media/icons/project-icon.png)

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose a service page, horizontal nav](media/connect-projects/project-summary-page-choose-app-vert.png)  

    ::: moniker-end
 
    ::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

    From the project summary page, hover over a service and then choose the page you want. To choose another project, choose the ![Azure DevOps logo](../../media/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose a service page, horizontal nav](media/connect-projects/project-summary-page-choose-app-horz.png)  

    ::: moniker-end

To learn more about each page and the tasks you can do, see [Web portal navigation](../../project/navigation/index.md).

### Use different Visual Studio credentials

You can run Visual Studio with credentials different from your current Windows user account. Find *devenv.exe* under the *Program Files (86)* folder for your version of Visual Studio.

Select Shift and right-click *devenv.exe*, then select **Run as different user**.

![Context menu for Visual Studio devenv.exe](media/connect-projects-tfs/IC719959.png)

### User accounts and licensing for Visual Studio

To connect to a project, you need your user account added to the project. The **Organization owner** for Azure DevOps Services or a member of the **Project Administrators** group usually adds user accounts. To learn more, see [Add organization users and manage access](../accounts/add-organization-users.md) or [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](../security/add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md). 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
Azure DevOps Services provides access to the first five account users free. After that, you need to [pay for more users](../billing/buy-basic-access-add-users.md). 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

For on-premises TFS, each user account must have a TFS client access license (CAL). All Visual Studio subscriptions and paid Azure DevOps Services users include a TFS CAL. Find out more about licensing from the [Team Foundation Server pricing page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/tfs-pricing).

::: moniker-end

You can also provide access to Stakeholders in your organization who have limited access to select features as described in [Work as a Stakeholder](../security/get-started-stakeholder.md).

## Configure Visual Studio to connect to Azure DevOps Proxy Server

If your remote team uses a [Azure DevOps Proxy Server](/azure/devops/server/install/install-proxy-setup-remote) to cache files, you can configure Visual Studio to connect through that proxy server and download files under Team Foundation version control.

1. First, make sure that you've connected to Azure DevOps Server as described [in the previous section](#visual-studio).

1. From the Visual Studio **Tools** menu, select **Options**, then select **Source Control** > **Plug-in Selection**. Select **Visual Studio Team Foundation Server**.

    ![Plug-in Selection page, Options dialog box](media/connect-projects-tfs/plug-in-selection-for-visual-studio.png)

1. For **Visual Studio Team Foundation Server**, enter the name and port number for the Azure DevOps Proxy Server. Select **Use SSL encryption (https) to connect**.

    ![VS TFVC proxy configuration page, Options dialog](media/connect-projects-tfs/visual-studio-proxy-server-options.png)

    Make sure you specify the port number that your administrator assigned to TFS Proxy.

To associate a file type with a compare or merge tool, see [Associate a file type with a file-comparison tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-file-comparison-tool.md) or [Associate a file type with a merge tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-merge-tool.md).

### What other clients support connection to Azure DevOps?

Besides connecting through a web browser, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Excel, and Project you can connect to a project from these clients:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs)
- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) 
- [Eclipse: Team Explorer Everywhere](/previous-versions/azure/devops/all/java/download-eclipse-plug-in) 
- [Azure Test Plans](/previous-versions/azure/devops/test/mtm/guidance-mtm-usage) (formerly Test Manager)
- [Microsoft Feedback Client](../../project/feedback/give-feedback.md) 

### Requirements and client compatibility

Some tasks or features aren't available when you connect to a later version of Azure DevOps Server than your client supports. For more information, see [client compatibility](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).

### Determine your platform version

See [Look up your Azure DevOps platform and version](../../user-guide/lookup-platform-version.md).
