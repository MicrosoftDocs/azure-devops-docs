# Connect to a project on VSTS or TFS

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

To share code, build apps, track work, and collaborate with team members, you connect to a project from one of the following clients:
  
- [Web portal](#web-portal)  
- [Visual Studio or Team Explorer](#visual-studio)  
- [Eclipse/Team Explorer Everywhere](../../repos/git/share-your-code-in-git-eclipse.md)
- [Android Studio with the VSTS Plugin for Android Studio](../../java/download-android-studio-plug-in.md)  
- [IntelliJ with the VSTS Plugin for IntelliJ](../../java/download-intellij-plug-in.md) 
- [Visual Studio Code](../../java/vscode-extension.md)    

> [!NOTE]
> A project defines a process and data storage in which you manage your software projects from planning to deployment. When you connect to a project, you connect to an organization or project collection. Within that collection, one or more projects may be defined. At a minimum, at least one project must be created in order to use the system. For more information, see [About projects and scaling your organization](about-projects.md).

If you don't have a project yet, create one in [VSTS](../accounts/set-up-vs.md) or set one up in an [on-premises TFS](create-project.md). If you need to add a team, see [Multiple teams](../../work/scale/multiple-teams.md). If you don't have access to the project, [get invited to the team](../security/add-users-team-project.md). 

From each of these clients, you can quickly switch context to a different project and connect under a different sign-in user name. If you work remotely, you can configure your client to [connect to a TFS Proxy server](#proxy).

To get started with a code base, [set up Git](../../repos/git/gitquickstart.md) or [set up TFVC](../../repos/tfvc/overview.md).

## Connect from Microsoft Excel or Project

To add or modify work items by using Excel or Project, you connect your worksheet or project plan to a project. Establishing this connection binds the document to the VSTS organization or selected TFS, project collection, and project to exchange information. 
 

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't use Office Project 365 to connect to VSTS or TFS.
 
### Connect from a worksheet or project plan

To follow these procedures, you must be a member of the **Readers** group or have your **View work items in this node** permission set to **Allow**. See [Permission reference](../security/permissions.md) for details.

1.  If you don't have Office Excel 2007 or a more recent version, [install it](https://products.office.com/excel). For VSTS or TFS 2017, you'll need Project 2010 or a more recent version. For client compatibility, see [Client compatibility](/tfs/server/compatibility)

2.  If you haven't installed a version of [Visual Studio (2010 or later)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) or [Team Foundation Server Standalone Office Integration (free)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=Office+Integration), you'll need to install one of these versions to connect to a project defined on VSTS or an on-premises TFS. 

	> [!NOTE]  
	> **Feature availability:** The only way to get the Team Foundation add-in to Excel is by installing one of the latest editions of Visual Studio or [TFS Standalone Office Integration](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=Office+Integration).   

3.  Start with a blank worksheet or project plan. If you don't see the **Team** ribbon (or the **Team** menu if you use Excel 2007 or Project 2007), see step 2.

    ![Create a list connection between Excel and the data store](../../work/backlogs/office/_img/bulk-modify-excel-blank-list.png)

    > [!TIP]    
    > If the **Team** ribbon no longer appears, you might need to [re-enable it](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-re-enable-a-vsto-add-in-that-has-been-disabled).

4.  Connect to a VSTS organization or a TFS instance and the project. If you can't connect, [get added as a team member](../security/add-users-team-project.md).

    ![Connect to server](../../work/backlogs/office/_img/IC680074.png)

    If it is your first time connecting from Excel or Project, you might have to add the VSTS organization or TFS server to the list of recognized servers.

    ![Add organization or server](../../work/backlogs/office/_img/IC658167.png)

5.  Your worksheet or project plan is now bound to your project. What this means is that you can add work items to the project from the Office document or add work items to the Office document from the project.

    To learn more, see [Bulk add work items with Excel](../../work/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Create your backlog and tasks using Project](../../work/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> If the project is moved to a different project collection in the same instance of TFS, your documents will automatically be reconnected. However, if the project is moved to a different instance of TFS, you must manually reconnect your documents to the new server.

### Work offline

An advantage to using Excel or Project is that you can work offline to add or modify work items. Complete the following procedures to disconnect an Excel worksheet or Project plan and later reconnect to synchronize your updates with the work item database.

### Disconnect the document from a project

1.  Open the document that you want to change while you are offline.

2.  Follow one of the following steps:

    -   If you are using Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Refresh**.

    -   If you are using Project, on the **Team** menu, choose **Refresh**.

    This step refreshes the work item list to retrieve the latest information from the work item database.

3.  If you are using Excel, add to the work item list the columns for all fields that you want to modify.

    You cannot add columns when the work item list is not connected to TFS.

4.  Save your Excel or Project file. You can now modify the information even if you are offline, disconnected from the project or network. 

5.  Change the work item list as needed.

	>[!NOTE]  
	>You cannot create most types of links between work items when the work item document is not connected to the project. The exceptions are parent-child links in an Excel tree list and both parent-child and predecessor-successor links in a Project plan.

#### Reconnect the document to the project

1.  Make sure your computer is online.  

2.  If you changed the document while you were offline, follow one of these steps:

    -   If you are using Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Publish**.

    -   If you are using Project, on the **Team** menu, choose **Publish Changes**.

3.  If you did not change the document while you were offline, follow one of these steps:

    -   If you are using Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Refresh**.

    -   If you are using Project, on the **Team** menu, choose **Refresh**.

4.  Resolve any data validation errors or conflicts that occur.

To start planning and tracking work, see [Get started with Agile tools to plan and track work](../../work/backlogs/overview.md). 

### User accounts and licensing

To connect to a project, you need your user account added to the project. This is typically done by the [organization owner (VSTS)](../accounts/add-organization-users-from-user-hub.md) or a [project administrator](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). 

::: moniker range="vsts"
VSTS provides access to the first 5 account users free. After that, you need to [pay for more users (VSTS)](../../billing/buy-basic-access-add-users.md). 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"

For on-premises TFS, each user account must have a TFS client access license (CAL). All Visual Studio subscriptions and paid VSTS users include a TFS CAL. Find out more about licensing from the [Team Foundation Server pricing page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/tfs-pricing).

::: moniker-end

In addition, you can provide access to stakeholders in your organization who will have limited access to select features as described in [Work as a Stakeholder](../security/get-started-stakeholder.md).

## Configure Visual Studio to connect to TFS Proxy

If your remote team uses a [TFS Proxy server](/tfs/server/install/install-proxy-setup-remote) to cache files, you can configure Visual Studio to connect through that proxy server and download files under Team Foundation version control.

1.  First, make sure that you have connected to TFS as described [in the previous section](#visual-studio).

2.  From the Visual Studio **Tools** menu, open the Options dialog and expand the Source Control folder. On the Plug-in Selection page, confirm that Visual Studio Team Foundation Server is selected.

    ![Plug-in Selection page, Options dialog box](_img/connect-projects-tfs/IC719960.png)

3.  On the Visual Studio Team Foundation Server page, enter the name and port number for the TFS Proxy server. Select the **Use SSL encryption (https) to connect** checkbox.

    ![VS TFVC proxy configuration page, Options dialog](_img/connect-projects-tfs/IC719961.png)

    Make sure you specify the port number that your administrator assigned to TFS Proxy.

To **Configure User Tools** to associate a file type with a compare or merge tool, see [Associate a file type with a file-comparison tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-file-comparison-tool.md) or [Associate a file type with a merge tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-merge-tool.md).
