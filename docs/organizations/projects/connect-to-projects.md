# Connect to a project

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)] 

Learn how to connect to a project from a client, to share code, build apps, track work, and collaborate with team members. You can connect to a project from any of the following clients:
  
- [Web portal](#web-portal)  
- [Visual Studio or Team Explorer](#visual-studio)   
- [Android Studio with the Azure DevOps Services Plugin for Android Studio](/previous-versions/azure/devops/all/java/download-android-studio-plug-in)  
- [IntelliJ with the Azure DevOps Services Plugin for IntelliJ](/previous-versions/azure/devops/all/java/download-intellij-plug-in) 
- [Visual Studio Code](/previous-versions/azure/devops/all/java/vscode-extension)

A project defines a process and data storage in which you manage your software projects from planning to deployment. When you connect to a project, you connect to an organization or project collection. For more information, see [About projects and scaling your organization](about-projects.md).

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
|**Project membership**  |[Project member](../projects/create-project.md). |
|**Remote work** |If you work remotely, configure your client to [connect to an Azure DevOps Proxy Server](#proxy). From each client, you can switch context to a different project and connect as a different user. |
|**Code base setup**| [Set up Git](../../repos/git/gitquickstart.md) or [Set up Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)](../../repos/tfvc/index.yml).|

- Sign in to your project (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}/{Your_Project}```).
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=" < azure-devops" 
- Sign in to your project (```http://ServerName/{DefaultCollection}/{Project_Name}```). 
::: moniker-end

For more information, see [Web portal navigation](../../project/navigation/index.md).

If you selected just one project, you see the **Home** page for that project. The pages differ based on the resources enabled and the source control system selected for your project.

Team Explorer displays the **Home** page for that project. The pages that appear differ based on the resources enabled and the source control system selected for your project.

For more information, see [Navigate in Visual Studio Team Explorer](../../user-guide/work-team-explorer.md).

Your client remembers the set of connections you configure. You can switch from one project to another from the **Connect** page.

### Use different Visual Studio credentials

You can run Visual Studio with credentials different from your current Windows user account. Find *devenv.exe* under the *Program Files (86)* folder for your version of Visual Studio.

Select Shift and right-click *devenv.exe*, then select **Run as different user**.

![Screenshot of Context menu for Visual Studio devenv.exe.](media/connect-projects-tfs/IC719959.png)

### User accounts and licensing for Visual Studio

To connect to a project, you need your user account added to the project. The **Organization owner** for Azure DevOps or a member of the **Project Administrators** group usually adds user accounts. For more information, see [Add organization users and manage access](../accounts/add-organization-users.md) or [Add or remove users or groups, manage security groups](../security/add-remove-manage-user-group-security-group.md). 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
Azure DevOps Services provides access to the first five account users free. After that, you need to [pay for more users](../billing/buy-basic-access-add-users.md). 
::: moniker-end

You can also provide access to Stakeholders in your organization with limited access to specific features as described in [Work as a Stakeholder](../security/get-started-stakeholder.md).

## Configure Visual Studio to connect to Azure DevOps Proxy Server 

If your remote team uses an [Azure DevOps Proxy Server](/azure/devops/server/install/install-proxy-setup-remote) to cache files, you can configure Visual Studio to connect through that proxy server and download files under Team Foundation version control.

1. Make sure you're connected to Azure DevOps, as described [in the previous section](#visual-studio).

2. From the Visual Studio **Tools** menu, select **Options**, and then select **Source Control** > **Plug-in Selection**. Select **Visual Studio Team Foundation Server**.

    ![Screenshot of Plug-in Selection page, Options dialog box.](media/connect-projects-tfs/plug-in-selection-for-visual-studio.png)

3. For **Visual Studio Team Foundation Server**, enter the name and port number for the Azure DevOps Proxy Server. Select **Use SSL encryption (https) to connect**.

    ![Screenshot of VS TFVC proxy configuration page, Options dialog.](media/connect-projects-tfs/visual-studio-proxy-server-options.png)

    Make sure you specify the port number that your administrator assigned to Azure DevOps Proxy.

To associate a file type with a compare or merge tool, see [Associate a file type with a file-comparison tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-file-comparison-tool.md) or [Associate a file type with a merge tool](../../repos/tfvc/associate-file-type-merge-tool.md).
 

### Requirements and client compatibility

Some tasks or features aren't available when you connect to a later version of Azure DevOps than your client supports. For more information, see [client compatibility](/azure/devops/server/compatibility).

### Determine your platform version

See [Look up your Azure DevOps platform and version](../../user-guide/lookup-platform-version.md).
