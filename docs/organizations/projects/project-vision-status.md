> [!NOTE]   
> If you want to use a project wiki for your project Summary information, then first [create a Wiki for your project](../../project/wiki/wiki-create-repo.md). You can then [change the project summary page to point to the wiki](#update).

## Prerequisites

- You must be a member of the [**Project Administrators** group](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md) or have your **Edit project-level information** permission set to **Allow** to do the following:
  - Edit information on the project page
  - Change the repository that you use to share project information
  - Manage project membership
- To edit a page, you must be a contributor to the repository or branch or have the **Contribute** permissions set to **Allow**.  
- To view the project **Summary**, you must be a valid member of the project. For more information, see [About security, membership, and permissions; Valid user groups](../security/about-permissions.md#validusers).
- To add or edit project **Tags**, you must have the project-level **Manage properties** permission set to **Allow**. This permission controls the project properties REST API. The project properties REST API is used to drive the project tags experience in the product.  

> [!TIP]    
> If you don't have permissions to edit a page or use a feature, the corresponding icons and links aren't visible. 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
## Open project Summary

From your web browser, choose **Overview>Summary**. If you don't have a  project yet, [create a project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).

If you haven't set up your project summary yet, you'll see this welcome page:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Open project summary, new nav](media/share-project/welcome-page-new-nav.png)  

Select one of the following tasks to get started:

- **Invite** to begin [adding others to your project](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). You can only invite users who have already been [added to your organization](../security/add-users-team-project.md#add-users-to-a-project)).
- **Boards** to begin [adding work items](../../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md).
- **Repos** to open [Repos>Files](../../repos/git/clone.md) page where you can clone or import a repository, or [initialize a README file](#initialize-a-readme-file-for-a-git-repo) for your project summary page.
- **Pipelines** to start [defining a pipeline](../../pipelines/index.yml).
- **Test Plans** to start [defining test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).
- [Manage your services](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md) to disable the visibility of one or more services.

## Open project Home page
From your web browser, open the team project drop down menu and select the home page. If you don't have a  project, [create a team project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).

![Open Project Summary](media/share-project/project-vision-status-project-home-page.png)

To define a README file for your project, see [Initialize a README file for your Git repo](#initialize-git) or  [Initialize a README file for your TFVC repo](#initialize-tfvc).

::: moniker-end

<a id="update" />

## Update the page

The **Summary** page displays either the **README** file defined in a project repository or the home page of a project wiki. If you want to use the project wiki home page, first set that up as described in [Create a Wiki for your project](../../project/wiki/wiki-create-repo.md).

1. To edit the page:

	- If it is the first time editing the page, choose **Add Project Description**.  
	:::image type="content" source="media/summary/add-project-description.png" alt-text="Screenshot of summary page, first time editing.":::

	- If editing the page after it's been set up, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/edit.png" border="false"::: **Edit project information**. This icon is only visible to members with permissions to edit the project **Summary** page.
 
1. Provide a brief description of the project purpose in the **Description** box.  

	:::image type="content" source="media/summary/about-this-project-dialog.png" alt-text="About this project dialog.":::

1. Optionally add one or more **Tags** for your project. These tags are similar to [work item tags](../../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md). You can add several tags at a time by using the comma or semicolon delimiters. Tags must conform to the following rules:  
	- Tags must be 40 characters or less
	- Tags can;t contain the forward slash (/) character or end with hyphen character (-)
	- No more than 15 tags can be added to a project  
	- Tags are case-insensitive and no duplicate tags or empty tags are allowed.

	> [!NOTE]   
	> The search and filter functions can't be used to search or filter on project tags. 

1. Choose whether to reference a **README** file or the project wiki home page for the rest of the Summary page contents.  

	> [!TIP] 
	> A default README is created within the repository added when you created your project. You can choose this README or create another repository and README file for this purpose. 

	If choosing a **Readme file**, select the repository for the README. A preview of the current text for the README file is shown. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/summary/select-readme-repository.png" alt-text="About this project dialog, choose and select README repository.":::

	If choosing **Wiki**, note that the Wiki home page is referenced and must be the first file within the Wiki TOC. You can't change that reference.  

1. To update the contents of the referenced README file or wiki, edit the corresponding file. For more information, see [Create a README for your repo](../../repos/git/create-a-readme.md) or [Add and edit wiki pages](../../project/wiki/add-edit-wiki.md). 
 
	Consider including the following types of information in your **Summary** page:
	- Ways in which users can contribute to your project 
	- Who to contact to elevate permissions or add extensions  
	- Roadmap information 
	- Links to instructions for setting up their development and test environments 
	- Links to instructions for collaborating on code, tracking work, building pipelines, deploying releases 
	- Links to templates to file a bug, issue, or request 
	- Links to distribution lists to email a question or post a question on Slack or Teams channel.

## Initialize a README file for a Git repo

You can share your project and objective, as well as ways for team members to contribute to the project through a project README file. For Git projects, the README.md file needs to be at the root of each repository in the default branch. For Git based projects the left pane supports navigation to other repositories. A separate Welcome page/README.md file can be created for each repository.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Open **Repos>Files**. This page guides you to get started quickly by adding code to your repository when you choose one of the options to clone, push, import, or initialize a repo.  

2. With the **Add a README** check box checked, choose **Initialize**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Screenshot of Initialize README file, latest versions](media/share-project/initialize-readme-new-nav.png)

   A default README file is added to the project repository, in this case, the **Fabrikam Test** repo.

3. Return to **Overview** > **Summary** and choose the README file for the project page. Select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/edit.png" border="false"::: **Edit**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Choose README file, new nav](media/share-project/choose-readme-file-new-nav.png)  

4. Select the project repository where you initialized the README file.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Choose Repository where the README file exists, new nav](media/share-project/choose-readme-file-dialog-new-nav.png)  

5. To edit the README file, choose the README file link.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Edit the README file, new nav](media/share-project/edit-readme-file.png)  

   You're directed to the **Repos>Files** page for the README file. You can edit and modify the README Markdown file like you would any other file in a Git repository. You can use Markdown language to format the README file and add images. To learn more about adding a README file, see [Create a README for your repo](../../repos/git/create-a-readme.md) and [Markdown guidance](../../project/wiki/markdown-guidance.md).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

1. Open the Project home page.

2. With the **Add a README** check box checked, choose **Initialize**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Screenshot of Initialize README file, new nav](media/share-project/initialize-readme-prev-nav.png)

   A default README file is added to the project repository, in this case, the **Fabrikam Test** repo.

3. To edit the project README.md file, choose **Edit**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Git new project summary page](media/share-project/git-start-page-readme.png)

   Use Markdown language to format the README file and add images. To learn more about adding a README file, see [Create a README for your repo](../../repos/git/create-a-readme.md) and [Markdown guidance](../../project/wiki/markdown-guidance.md).

## Initialize a README file for a TFVC repo

For projects that selected TFVC for version control, the README.md file needs to be at the root of your team project folder (i.e. $/TeamProject/README.md).

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Open **Repos>Files**.

2. Select **Add Project Description**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Welcome page, TFVC new project, create readme, new nav](media/share-project/welcome-page-tfvc-new-nav.png)

3. Select the TFVC repository and choose **Save**. If no README file has been created yet in the repo, you'll see the following message.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![About this project dialog, new nav](media/share-project/about-this-project-form.png)

4. To create a README file, choose **Repos>Files** and choose new file to add a file to the project repository.

5. Name the file as **README.md**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Add new file dialog, new nav](media/share-project/create-readme-file-web-portal.png)

6. Add the contents of your README file in Markdown format, and then choose **Check in...**.  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Enter README file contents, new nav](media/share-project/tfvc-readme-file.png)

7. Select **Check in** to complete the check in process of the README file.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Check-in README file dialog, new nav](media/share-project/tfvc-readme-checkin.png)

8. Select **Overview>Summary** to review your project summary page with the README file displayed.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Project summary page with the README file displayed.](media/share-project/tfvc-project-summary-with-readme.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

1. Open the Project home page.

2. Select **Create README**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Welcome page, TFVC new project, create README](media/share-project/welcome-page-tfvc-prev-nav.png)

   A default README file is added to the project repository, in this case, the **Fabrikam Fiber TFVC** repo.

3. You can immediately edit the README file. When you're done, select **Check in**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Edit page, new nav](media/share-project/tfvc-checkin-page.png)  
Any additional Markdown files you have (ones with a *.md extension) in the root of the project folder also appear in the left pane for easy navigation between them so you can provide additional information.
