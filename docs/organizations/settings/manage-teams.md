# Manage and configure team tools

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

As a team administrator, you can customize your backlogs and board to best meet how your team works. If you need to have a team created, request a member of your Project Administrators group do so. It only takes a minute to add a new team.    Team settings are managed by the team administrator role. Users assigned as team administrator can configure and manage all team tools.  

Team administrators should do the following tasks: 
- [Add team members](#add-users-to-a-team)
- [Add another team administrator](#add-an-administrator) 
- [Configure areas and iteration paths](#configure-team-areas-and-iterations)
- [Configure backlogs, boards, and general settings](#configure-team-backlogs)

Also, consider the following optional tasks: 
- [Configure and manage team dashboards](#add-and-manage-team-dashboards)
- [Configure team notifications](#manage-notifications) 

## Prerequisites

- To perform any team configuration task, you need to be added as a team administrator for the team to be modified, or be a member of the **Project Administrators** group. See [Change project-level permissions](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md).  
- To add a team, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** group. For more information, see [Add teams](add-teams.md).

## Open your team profile

Open your team profile to quickly access items defined for your team.

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```), and then open your project.
2. Select **Project settings** > **Teams** > your team name.

## Add users to a team
 
Several tools, such as capacity planning, team alerts, and dashboard widgets, are team-scoped. These tools automatically reference the users that are as members of a team to support planning activities or sending alerts. 

To add users to a team, see [Add users to a project or specific team](../security/add-users-team-project.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/add-team-member.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add button highlighted, to add team member.":::

All members of a team can favorite team artifacts and define work item templates. For more information, see: 
- [Set personal or team favorites](../../project/navigation/set-favorites.md)
- [Use templates to add and update work items](../../boards/backlogs/work-item-template.md).

If team members don't have access to all the features they want, make sure they have [the permissions needed for those features](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).  

## Add an administrator

When you add a team to a project, a Project Administrator should [add one or more team administrators](add-team-administrator.md). 

:::image type="content" source="media/add-administrator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add button highlighted, to add an administrator.":::

## Configure team areas and iterations 

Many Agile tools depend on the area and iteration paths that are configured for the team. To learn more about configuring team areas and iterations, see [About teams and Agile tools](about-teams-and-settings.md). 

Once project administrators [add area paths](set-area-paths.md) and [iteration paths](set-iteration-paths-sprints.md) for a project, team administrators can select the area and iteration paths associated with their team. These settings affect many Agile tools available to the team. 

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-iterations-areas.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Iterations and areas highlighted.":::

Settings include making the following associations for each team:  

- **Select team Area Paths**   
	Can select the default area path(s) associated with the team. These settings affect many Agile tools available to the team.	
- **Select team Iteration Paths or sprints** 
	Can select the default area path(s) associated with the team. These settings affect many Agile tools available to the team. 
 
For more information, see [Define area paths and assign to a team](set-area-paths.md) and 
[Define iteration paths and configure team iterations](set-iteration-paths-sprints.md).

## Configure team backlogs, boards, and general settings 

Team administrators can choose which backlog levels are active for a team. For example, a feature team may choose to show only the product backlog and a management team may choose to show only the feature and epic backlogs. Also, administrators can choose whether bugs are treated similar to user stories and requirements or as tasks. 

Team administrators can also choose which days are non-working days for the team. Sprint planning and tracking tools automatically consider days off when calculating capacity and sprint burndown.   

You can configure most of your team settings from the common configuration dialog.

Team administrators can fully customize the team's Kanban boards associated with the product and portfolio backlogs. You configure a Kanban board by first defining the columns and WIP limits from the common configuration dialog. For guidance, see [Kanban basics](../../boards/boards/kanban-basics.md).
