# Manage and configure team tools

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

If you're a team administrator, you have the flexibility to tailor your backlogs and boards to align with your team's workflow. In case you require a new team, you can ask a Project Administrator group member to create one for you, which takes only a minute. Team administrators have the ability to set up and oversee all team tools.

Team administrators perform the following tasks for team tools: 
- [Add team members](#add-users-to-a-team)
- [Add another team administrator](#add-an-administrator) 
- [Configure areas and iteration paths](#configure-team-areas-and-iterations)
- [Configure backlogs, boards, and general settings](#configure-team-backlogs)
- [Configure and manage team dashboards](#add-and-manage-team-dashboards)
- [Configure team notifications](#manage-notifications) 

## Prerequisites

- To perform any team configuration task, you must be a team administrator for the team to be modified, or be a member of the **Project Administrators** group. For more information, see [Change project-level permissions](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md).  
- To add a team, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** group. For more information, see [Add teams](add-teams.md).

## Open your team profile

Open your team profile to quickly access items defined for your team.

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```), and then open your project.
2. Select **Project settings** > **Teams** > your team name.

## Add users to a team
 
Tools like capacity planning, team alerts, and dashboard widgets operate within the scope of a team. They automatically access the user information of team members to facilitate planning tasks or issue alerts.

To add users to a team, see [Add users to a project or specific team](../security/add-users-team-project.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/add-team-member.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add button highlighted, to add team member.":::

All members of a team can favorite team artifacts and define work item templates. For more information, see: 
- [Set personal or team favorites](../../project/navigation/set-favorites.md)
- [Use templates to add and update work items](../../boards/backlogs/work-item-template.md).

If team members don't have access to all the features they want, make sure they have [the permissions needed for those features](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).  

## Add an administrator

When you add a team to a project, a Project Administrator should [add one or more team administrators](add-team-administrator.md). 

:::image type="content" source="media/add-administrator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add button highlighted, to add an administrator.":::

## Configure team areas and iterations 

Many Agile tools rely on the team's configured area and iteration paths. For more information, see [About teams and Agile tools](about-teams-and-settings.md). 

After project administrators add the project's area and iteration paths using [Set area paths](set-area-paths.md) and [Set iteration paths](set-iteration-paths-sprints.md), team administrators can choose the relevant area and iteration paths for their team. These settings influence a wide range of Agile tools that the team can access.

:::image type="content" source="media/manage-iterations-areas.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Iterations and areas highlighted.":::

Settings include making the following associations for each team:  

- **Select team area paths**   
	Can select the default area path(s) associated with the team. These settings affect many Agile tools available to the team.	
- **Select team iteration paths or sprints** 
	Can select the default area path(s) associated with the team. These settings affect many Agile tools available to the team. 
 
For more information, see [Define area paths and assign to a team](set-area-paths.md) and 
[Define iteration paths and configure team iterations](set-iteration-paths-sprints.md).

## Configure team backlogs, boards, and general settings 

As a team administrator, you have the flexibility to customize your team's workflow to suit your needs. One way to do so is by choosing which backlog levels are active for your team. For instance, a feature team might only want to display the product backlog, while a management team might prefer to show the feature and epic backlogs only. Also, you can choose how to treat bugs within your workflow, either as user stories and requirements or as tasks.

Another way to customize your team's workflow is by selecting non-working days for the team. By doing so, sprint planning and tracking tools can automatically take these days off into account when calculating capacity and sprint burndown.

Most of these team settings can be easily configured from the common configuration dialog, providing a convenient way to manage your team's workflow in one central location.

Team administrators have complete control over customizing their team's Kanban boards for both the product and portfolio backlogs. To set up a Kanban board, you can define the columns and work-in-progress (WIP) limits through the common configuration dialog. For more information, see [Kanban overview](../../boards/boards/kanban-overview.md) and [Kanban quickstart](../../boards/boards/kanban-quickstart.md).
