# Add a custom field to a work item type (Inheritance process)    

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../../boards/_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

You add a custom field to support tracking data requirements you have that aren't met with the existing set of fields. For example, you can add a custom field to track a customer ticket number. For a list of all fields defined for your organization&mdash;which includes all fields defined for system and inherited processes&mdash;see [Review fields](customize-process-field.md#review-fields).  

> [!TIP]    
> To customize a single project, always start by [creating an inherited process and updating your project to that process](manage-process.md). Then, all the customizations that you make to the inherited process automatically appear for the project you migrated.

To learn more about what you can customize, see [About process customization and inherited processes](inheritance-process-model.md).

## Add a field 

You always add a field to an existing work item type.  

0. From the **Process** page of the selected  inherited process, choose the work item type you want to add the custom field to. 

	Here we choose the Bug WIT. Note the breadcrumb links that allow you to move back to the **All Processes** and **MyAgile** process page. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![All Processes-Process-WIT breadcrumb links](_img/field/breadcrumbs-bug-wit.png) 
	
0. With the WIT selected, choose the ![ ](_img/process/new-field-icon.png) (**New Field** icon).  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Process Work Item Types page, Add a field to a WIT](_img/field/bug-new-field.png) 

0. Name the field and select the field type from one of the supported data types. Field names must be unique and no more than 128 characters. For additional restrictions, see [What is a field? How are field names used?](inheritance-process-model.md#field-reference). Optionally, add a description.  

	> [!NOTE]   
	> Once created, you can't change the field name or data type. 

	Here we add an Integer field labeled Customer Ticket. 

    <img src="_img/process/cpfield-add-field-to-bug-type-integer-up1.png" alt="Add a field to Bug, choose field type" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" /> 

	Additional data types you can add include: [Picklist](add-custom-field.md#pick-list), [Identity](add-custom-field.md#identity), [Rich-text, HTML](add-custom-field.md#html),[Checkbox](add-custom-field.md#boolean-field).  
	<a id="options">  </a>  
0.	(Optional) On the **Options** tab, indicate if the field is required and specify a default value. Or leave these blank. 

	<img src="_img/process/cpfield-bug-customer-ticket-options.png" alt="Add a field to Use story, specify options" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

	By making a field Required, users must specify a value for the field in order to save it. The default value you specify is set when you create a work item as well as every time a work item is opened and the field is empty.

	<a id="layout">  </a>
0.	(Optional) On the **Layout** tab, you can enter a different form label than the name of the field. Also, you can choose the page and group where the field will appear on the form. 

	Here, we add the Customer Ticket field to a new group labeled Customer focus. 

	<img src="_img/process/cpfield-customer-ticket-layout.png" alt="Add a field to Use story, specify layout" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

0.	Click **Add field** to complete adding the field. If you haven't specified it's layout location, it will be added to the first group of fields on the layout form.  

	> [!TIP]    
	> Once you've added a field, you can drag-and-drop it within a page to relocate it on the form. If you have several fields you want to add to a custom page or group, then you may want to [add those elements first](customize-process-form.md) and then add your fields.

## Verify the customization you made 

We recommend that you create a test project and apply your customized  inherited process to it to verify the changes you've made.
