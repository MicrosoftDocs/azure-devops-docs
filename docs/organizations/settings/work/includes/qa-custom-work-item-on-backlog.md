### Q: How do I get my custom work item type to show up on my backlog?

**A:** Modify your requirement backlog to include the custom work item type. For details, see [Customize your backlogs or boards, Edit or rename the requirement backlog](../customize-process-backlogs-boards.md#edit-or-rename-the-requirement-backlog). 

> [!NOTE]  
> The backlog level to which you add a custom work item type determines the parent work item type(s) for the work item type.
