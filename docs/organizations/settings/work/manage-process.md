# Create and manage inherited processes 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../../boards/_shared/version-vsts-plus-azdevserver-2019.md)]

You customize your project, Agile tools, and the work tracking system through an inherited process. The customizations you make are in effect for all projects that use the process. A process defines the building blocks of the work tracking system. Whenever you create a project, you select the process you want your project to use. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/note-on-prem-link.md)]

To learn more about what you can customize, see [About process customization and inherited processes](inheritance-process-model.md). 

In this article, learn how to perform these tasks:

## Create an inherited process
You can create an inherited process from any one of the four system processes:[Basic](../../../boards/get-started/track-issues-tasks.md), [Agile](../../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md).   

1. From the **Process** page, open the **&hellip;** context menu of the process you'll use to create an inherited process, and then choose **Create inherited process**. 

	Here, we create an inherited process from the Agile system process.   

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Context menu, Choose Create inherited process](_img/process/create-inherited-process.png) 

	If you don't have access to these options, ask your project collection admin to [grant you permissions](../../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md#collection-level).

1. Enter a name for your process and optionally a description. (For naming restrictions, see [About process customization and inherited processes, Process name restrictions](inheritance-process-model.md#process-naming).

   <img src="_img/process/mprocess-create-inherited-process-dialog.png" alt="Create inherited process dialog" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

Once you've defined the inherited process, you can perform these actions: 
- [Customize a project using an inherited process](customize-process.md)   
- [Create a project](#create-team-project) that uses the inherited process  
- [Change project(s) to use the inherited process](#migrate)        

<a id="migrate"></a>
## Change the process used by a project    

You can change the process a project uses from a system process or inherited process to another inherited process. There are two mechanisms to change a projects process. The first is to switch to a process where the project is derived from the same system process. Meaning, you can move a project between processes that use the same base process like Agile or Scrum.

The second method is to migrate your project between two completely different process types. For example, moving from Agile to Scrum, or Basic to Agile.

For the second method, we have provided detailed steps for three common scenerios of changing the process used by a project.

- [Scrum to Agile](./change-process-scrum-to-agile.md)
- [Agile to Scrum](./change-process-agile-to-scrum.md)
- [Basic to Agile](./change-process-basic-to-agile.md)

> [!NOTE]    
> You can change the process of a project as long as you don't have any undeleted work items of a custom work item type that isn't also defined in the target process. 
>
>Also, if you change a project to a system process or other inherited process that doesn't contain the same custom fields, data is still maintained. However, the custom fields that aren't represented in the current process won't appear on the work item form. You can still access the field data through a query or REST APIs. These fields are essentially locked from changes and appear as read-only values.  

1. Open the &hellip; context menu for the process and choose the **Change team projects**&hellip; option. 

	Here we open the menu for the Agile system process:

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Agile process context menu, Choose Change team projects to use Agile](_img/process/change-project-to-system-process.png) 

	The system lists only those projects that are valid for the current process.

1. Click the checkbox of those projects you want to change to use the Agile process.    

	Here we choose to use the Agile process for the Fabrikam Fiber A and Fabrikam Fiber projects.  Only those projects created from the Agile process or one that inherits from Agile appear under the Available projects column.
 
	<img src="_img/process/mprocess-change-process-dialog-to-agile.png" alt="Change process to a system process dialog" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

2. After  you've confirmed that the projects you want to change are correct, click Ok. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>When you change a project to use an inherited process, you may find one or more Agile tools or work items appear in an invalid state. For example: 
> 
> - If you make a field required, work items with that field undefined show an error message. You'll need to resolve the errors to make additional changes and save the work item. 
> - If you add or remove/hide workflow states of a WIT that appears on the Kanban board, you'll need to update the Kanban board column configurations for all teams defined in the project.

## Create a project from a process 

1. Open the &hellip; context menu for the process you want to use and choose **New project**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create a project from the selected process](_img/process/add-new-team-project.png) 

1. The Create new project page opens. For details, see [Create a project](../../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).

<a id="copy-process">  </a>
## Copy a process

It's a good practice to test the customizations you make before rolling out the changes to your organization.  To do this, you create a copy of a process, make your updates, verify the updates appear as desired, and then move projects to the new process.  
 
> [!TIP]    
> If you make a change to a process that is used by one or more projects, each project that uses the process updates immediately to the incremental process change. To bundle your process changes before you roll them out to all projects, following the  steps outlined next.

1. Create a copy of the process that you want to change. From the **Process** page, open the &hellip; context menu for the process you want to copy and choose **Copy process**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Make a copy of a selected inherited process](_img/process/copy-process.png) 

1. Fill out the dialog with the name of the copied process and choose **Copy process**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Make a copy of a selected inherited process](_img/process/copy-process-dialog.png) 
	
1. Make your changes to the copied process. Since no project is using this process, these changes do not impact any project. 

1. To verify your changes, create a test project based on the copied and updated process. If you have already created a test project, change the process of the test project using the [**Change project to use <process name>**](#migrate) option from the context menu. 

1. Once you have fully tested your customizations, you're ready to roll out your changes to all projects. To do this, change the process of the projects which need the new changes. Select the [**Change project to use <process name>**](#migrate) option from the context menu.  

1.  Disable or delete the original process. 
 

<a id="enable-process">  </a>
## Enable/disable a process

To prevent projects being created from a process, you disable it. You might choose this option when you want to apply several customizations and don't want the process used until they are complete. Or, you might want to retire use of a process in favor of moving  projects to a new process. 

All system processes and newly created inherited processes are enabled by default. 

- To disable or enable a process, open the &hellip; context menu for the process and choose **Disable process** or **Enable process**. 


<a id="default-process">  </a>
## Set the default process

Set an inherited process as the default to have it pre-selected for any additional projects you plan to create. 

To set a process as the default, open the &hellip; context menu for the inherited process and choose **Set as default process**. Note that this option is not available with any of the three system processes. 

Project Collection Administrators can [add projects](../../projects/create-project.md) from the **Projects** page.

### Programmatically work with processes 

You can get, create, update, and delete processes defined for an organization using the [REST API, Processes](/rest/api/azure/devops/processes/processes).
