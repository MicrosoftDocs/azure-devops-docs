# Customize a project using an inherited process

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

Each project is based on a process that defines the building blocks for tracking work. The first project you create uses one of the default processes&mdash;[**Agile**](../../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [**Basic**](../../../boards/get-started/plan-track-work.md), [**Scrum**](../../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [**CMMI**](../../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md).

You can only customize inherited processes. Any changes you make to the inherited process automatically appear in the projects that use that process. You can quickly customize a process by adding or modifying a work item type (WIT) that's part of the process. Otherwise, use the following sequence to customize a project:

1. **Customize an inherited process:** Modify the inherited process to align with your specific requirements by modifying fields, WITs, workflows, forms, and backlogs.
2. **Verify your customizations:** Create a test project and validate your changes.
3. **Apply inherited process to a project:** Add a new project based on inherited process and change the process used by an existing team project.
4. **Refresh and verify your customizations:** Refresh the web portal and open a work item of the type you modified.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/process-prerequisites.md)]

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/automatic-update-project.md)]

## Add or modify a field 

Locked :::image type="icon" source="media/process/locked-icon.png" border="false"::: fields and inherited :::image type="icon" source="media/process/inherited-icon.png" border="false"::: fields correspond to inherited fields from a system process. You can't customize locked fields, but you can customize some options for inherited fields. You can fully customize fields that you add to a process. 

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).
2. Select ![gear icon](../../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.
  
   ![Screenshot showing highlighted Organization settings button.](../../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)

3. Select **Process** > your **inherited process** > the **WIT** you want to customize. 
4. To add a field, choose the :::image type="icon" source="media/process/new-field-icon.png" border="false"::: (**New Field** icon).  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of Process Work Item Types page, Add a field to a WIT.](media/field/bug-new-field.png)

	In the resulting dialog, choose the type of field that you want to add. For example: [integer](customize-process-field.md#add-field), [picklist (drop-down menu)](customize-process-field.md#pick-list), [person-name/Identity](customize-process-field.md#identity), [rich-text or HTML](customize-process-field.md#html), or [checkbox (boolean)](customize-process-field.md#boolean-field).

5. Modify an existing field in the following ways: 
	- [Change the field label](customize-process-field.md#rename-field)  
	- [Show/Hide field on form](customize-process-field.md#show-hide-field)  
	- [Set Required/Default options](customize-process-field.md#options)  
	- [Move the field within the layout](customize-process-form.md#move-field)
	- [Remove field from the form](customize-process-field.md#remove-field) 

## Add or modify a rule for a work item type
 
Add rules to support specific workflow and business use cases. Rules let you clear the value of a field, copy a value into a field, and apply values based on dependencies between different fields' values. 

1. Select your inherited process and the work item type.
2. Select **Rules** > **New rule**.   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing Process, WIT, Bug, Layout, New custom control.](media/rules/custom-rule-create-rule.png) 

For more information, see [Rules and rule evaluation](custom-rules.md).

## Add or modify work item types

You use different WITs to plan and track different types of work. The main reason you add a custom WIT is to customize the web form and workflow states to meet specific business use cases.

1. Select your inherited process and the WIT you want to customize. 

2. From the **Work Item Types** page, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../../media/icons/blue-add-icon.png" border="false"::: **New work item type**.

	:::image type="content" source="media/process/cpwit-add-new-wit.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Process, Inherited process, Work Item Types, Add new work item type.":::

3. Name the WIT and optionally specify a description, icon, and color. The icon and color you specify appear throughout the web portal, including on the work item form and when associated work items appear on a backlog, boards, query results, and more. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/process/cwit-create-wit-ticket.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Create new work item type dialog.":::

4. Select **Create** to save. 

    You can now add fields to the WIT, or customize it in the following ways:  
	- [Modify the workflow](#workflow)  
	- [Add or remove a custom control](#custom-control)  
	- [Add an extension](#extension) 
	- [Add/move/remove custom groups](customize-process-form.md#groups)  
	- [Add/move/delete custom pages](customize-process-form.md#pages)  

<a id="workflow"></a>

## Modify the workflow of a work item type 

Workflow states allow you to track the status of a work item as it moves from new to completed. 

1. To modify a workflow, choose your inherited process, the WIT, and then the **States** page.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Process page, Bug WIT, States tab, Add state](media/process/cpworkflow-add-state.png) 

1. You can modify the workflow in the following ways:   
	- [Hide a workflow state](customize-process-workflow.md#hide-state) 
	- [Add a state](customize-process-workflow.md#add-states)  
	- [Edit a state (change color or category)](customize-process-workflow.md#edit-state)  
	- [Remove a state](customize-process-workflow.md#remove-state)     
 
<a id="custom-control"></a>

## Add a custom control    

Custom controls provide more functionality to a work item form. 

From the **Process** page, select your inherited process > WIT > **Add custom control**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Screenshot showing Choose your inherited process, the WIT, and then Add custom control sequence.](media/process/cpcontrols-add-custom-control.png) 

For more information, see [Add extensions and custom controls to a work item type](custom-controls-process.md).

<a id="extension"></a> 

## Add an extension to a work item type

An extension is an installable unit that contributes new capabilities to your project.
  
> [!NOTE]   
> Group and Page extensions automatically get added to all WITs for all processes, both system and inherited. You can hide an extension for selected WITs within an inherited process. 

1. Go to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops), find an extension, and select **Get it free**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/process/marketplace-extension-work-item-checklist.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Marketplace extension, Work item checklist.":::

2. Choose the organization you want to add it to from the dropdown menu, and then select **Install**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/process/install-work-item-checklist-extension.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing selected organization and install button.":::

3. Return to the process and WIT and verify the extension is where you want it. You can drag it to where you want it on the form. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot showing Group extension on Bug work item form.](media/process/cpfield-add-checklist-extension.png) 

## Modify the backlog and boards 

You can add more WITs to a backlog level or create another portfolio backlog. For instance, consider the following example:

- We introduced a third-level portfolio backlog called **Initiatives**, specifically designed to track the custom **Initiative** WIT.
- We also renamed the product backlog to **Stories** and **Tickets**, signifying that it now encompasses both **User stories** and **Customer tickets**.
 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing Changes made to the backlog levels.](media/process/backlog-levels.png) 

1. From the **Process** page, select your inherited process > **Backlog levels**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot showing Web portal, Admin context, Process page, open Backlog levels.](media/process/process-backlog-levels-open.png) 

2. You can modify the backlog and board configuration in the following ways:    
	- [Add a custom WIT to a backlog or board](customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)  
	- [Change the default WIT](customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)  
	- [Rename the requirement backlog](customize-process-backlogs-boards.md#edit-product-backlog)  
	- [Rename a portfolio backlog](customize-process-backlogs-boards.md#edit-portfolio-backlog)  
	- [Add a portfolio backlog that displays custom WITs](customize-process-backlogs-boards.md#portfolio-backlogs)  
	- [Edit or rename a portfolio backlog](customize-process-backlogs-boards.md#edit-portfolio-backlog)  
	- [Delete the top-level custom portfolio backlog](customize-process-backlogs-boards.md#edit-portfolio-backlog) 

<a id="verify">  </a>

## Verify your customization

We recommend that you create a test project and apply your customized inherited process to it to verify the changes you made. All customizations made to a process go into effect immediately on all projects. If you want to stage your changes, you can do that using one of two methods: 
- [Create a test project and copy of your customized process](#test-project-copy-process)
- [Create a test organization and import/export your process](#test-import-export-process)

<a id="test-project-copy-process"></a>

### Create a test project and copy your customized process

1. From the **Process** page, select the &hellip; context menu for the process you want to use, and then select **New team project**.  

	::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create a project from the selected process](media/process/new-team-project-from-inherited-process-menu.png) 
	::: moniker-end
	::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create a project from the selected process](media/process/add-new-team-project.png) 
	::: moniker-end

2. Enter information into the form, and then select **Create**. For more information, see [Create a project](../../projects/create-project.md).

3. From your project, select **Boards** > **Work Items**, and then select the customized WIT from the **New Work Item** dropdown menu. 
   In the following example, we select **Bug**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot showing Work, Work Items Page, Add New Work Item, Bug sequence.](media/process/add-custom-field-verify-bug.png) 

4. Verify that one or more fields you added appear on the form. The :::image type="icon" source="../../../media/icons/required-icon.png" border="false"::: (exclamation mark) icon indicates the field is required.  

<a id="test-import-export-process"></a>

### Create a test organization and import/export your process

You can also use the following steps to verify the customizations you made to an inherited process. 
 
1. Create a test organization.  
2. Use the [import/export process tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/process-migrator) to copy the process to the test organization.  
3. Verify the process customizations in the test organization.   
4. Use the import/export process tool again to import the modified process to the production organization.
