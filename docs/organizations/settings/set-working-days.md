# Set working days  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Each team's sprint planning and tracking tools automatically consider days off when calculating capacity and sprint burndown. Leave those days of the week that your team doesn't work unchecked in your team's Settings, Working days page.  

If you're not a team administrator, [get added as one](add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can change team settings.  

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"   
<a id="team-services-work-days" />  

[Open the Capacity page](../../boards/sprints/set-capacity.md), and then choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/team-settings-gear-icon.png) gear icon to open the settings dialog.

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"   

<a  id="tfs-2015-work-days" />  

Open your team settings from the **Overview** tab of your team's admin context. Check or uncheck one or more days. Your changes are automatically saved.
