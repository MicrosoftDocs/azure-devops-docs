[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You configure resources either for yourself, your team, a project, or your organization from an administrative **Settings** page. The settings you can configure depend on the security group or administrative role you belong to. 

If you're just getting started as a project administrator, see [Get started as an administrator](../../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can delegate several tasks to a user with Stakeholder or Basic access by adding them to the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). To learn more about Stakeholder access, see [About access levels, Stakeholder access](../security/access-levels.md#stakeholder-access).

## Team administrator role and managing teams

Team administrators are tasked with configuring team resources which mostly correspond to Agile tools and dashboards. To configure team resources, you must be added as a [team administrator for the specific team](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md), or be a member of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators groups.  

For a complete overview of all Agile tools that you can configure, see [Manage teams and configure team tools](manage-teams.md).

## Project administrator role and managing projects

Members of the [Project Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) are tasked with configuring resources for a project and managing permissions at the project-level. Note that members of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) can configure team settings as well.

See also [Get started as an administrator](../../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md).

## Server administrator role 

Members of the [Team Foundation Server Administrators group](/tfs/server/admin/add-administrator-tfs) are tasked with configuring resources for all project collections. They also can perform all tasks to administer projects, collections, and server instances.     

The main task they perform from the web portal is to set access levels for a user or security group. See [Change access levels](../security/change-access-levels.md). 

For additional information, see [Team Foundation Server Administration Documentation](/tfs/index).
