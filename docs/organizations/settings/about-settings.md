# About settings for users, teams, projects, or organizations

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/version-all.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You configure resources either for yourself or for your team, project, or organization from an administrative **Settings** page. The settings you can configure depend on the security group or administrative role that you belong to. 

If you're just getting started as a Project Administrator, see [Get started as an administrator](../../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md). To quickly find a setting or related settings, see [Search organization settings](search-settings.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can delegate several tasks to a user with Stakeholder or Basic access by adding them to the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). For more information about Stakeholder access, see [About access levels, Stakeholder access](../security/access-levels.md#stakeholder-access).

## Team administrator role and managing teams

Team administrators configure team resources, which mostly correspond to Agile tools and dashboards. To configure team resources, you must be added as a [team administrator for the specific team](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md), or be a member of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators groups.  

For a complete overview of all Agile tools that you can configure, see [Manage teams and configure team tools](manage-teams.md).

## Project Administrator role and managing projects

Members of the [Project Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) configure resources for a project and managing permissions at the project-level. Members of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) can configure team settings as well.

See also [Get started as an administrator](../../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md).

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
**Project settings**  
From the administrative **Project settings** page, you can configure settings available from the tabs shown in the following image.

      A default team is created when you create a project.

Teams have access to a product backlog, portfolio backlogs, sprint backlogs, dashboards, team-scoped widgets, and more.

## Project Collection Administrator (PCA) role and managing collections of projects 

Members of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) configure resources for all projects that are defined for an organization or collection. They also can do all tasks to add projects, manage projects, and manage permissions for the collection, a project, a team, or an object.   

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
  
**Organization settings**  
From the administrative **Organization settings** page, you can configure settings available from the tabs shown in the following image and table. 

> [!NOTE]  
> If the **Limit user visibility for projects** preview feature is enabled for the organization, users added to the **Project-Scoped Users** group won't be able to access **Organization Settings** other than the **Overview** and **Projects** pages. To learn more, see [About projects and scaling your organization, Limit user visibility for projects using the Project-scoped User group](../../organizations/projects/about-projects.md#project-scoped-user-group).

## Server Administrator role 

Members of the [Team Foundation Server Administrators group](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator) configure resources for all project collections. They also can do all tasks to administer projects, collections, and server instances.     

Server Administrators set access levels for a user or security group via the web portal. See [Change access levels](../security/change-access-levels.md). 

For more information, see [Team Foundation Server Administration Documentation](/azure/devops/server/server).
