# About team, project, and organizational-level settings 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

From the administrative or **Settings** context, you configure resources that support your project and teams. This article provides a guide to the resources you can configure based on your role.  
  

## Individual contributor settings
Individual contributors can set their user preferences, enable select features that are in preview, and manage their favorites and notifications. 


<table>
<tbody valign="top">

<th width="15%">Area</th>
<th width="40%">Supported tasks</th>
<th width="45%">Notes</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>**General**</td>
<td><ul>
<li>[Set your preferences](set-your-preferences.md)</li> 
<li>[Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md)</li>

## Team administrator role and managing teams

Team administrators are tasked with configuring team resources which mostly correspond to Agile tools and dashboards. To configure team resources, you must be added as a [team administrator for the specific team](../../work/scale/add-team-administrator.md), or be a member of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators groups.  

For a complete overview of all team assets that you can configure, see [Manage team assets](../../work/scale/manage-team-assets.md).

## Project administrator role and managing projects

Members of the [Project Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) are tasked with configuring resources for a project and managing permissions at the project-level. Note that members of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) can perform project-level  tasks as well.

## Project collection administrator role and managing collections of projects 

Members of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) are tasked with configuring resources for all VSTS projects defined for an account or organization. They also can perform all tasks to add projects, manage projects, and manage permissions for the collection, a project, or an object.   

For an overview of managing your VSTS account, see [About account management](../accounts/organization-management.md).
