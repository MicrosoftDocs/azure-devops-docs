# Select backlog navigation levels for your team

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]  

Each team has the flexibility to choose their preferred backlog levels. Feature teams may focus on their product backlog, while management teams may only display feature and epic backlogs (the default portfolio backlogs). You can configure backlog levels through team settings. 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 
If you need more portfolio backlogs, see the following articles based on the process model you use: 
- **Inheritance**: [Customize your backlogs or boards for a process](work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)  
- **On-premises XML**: [Add portfolio backlogs](../../reference/add-portfolio-backlogs.md).  

For an overview of process models, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../../reference/customize-work.md).
