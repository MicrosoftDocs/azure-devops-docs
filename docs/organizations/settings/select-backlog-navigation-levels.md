# Select backlog navigation levels for your team

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]  

Each team can determine the backlog levels that they use. For example, feature teams may wish to only focus on their product backlog, while a management team may choose to only show feature and epics (the two default portfolio backlogs). You configure which backlog levels appear from your team settings dialog. 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 
If you need additional portfolio backlogs, see the following articles based on the process model you use: 
- **Inheritance**: [Customize your backlogs or boards for a process](work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)  
- **On-premises XML**: [Add portfolio backlogs](../../reference/add-portfolio-backlogs.md).  

For an overview of process models, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../../reference/customize-work.md).

## Set your team's preferences for backlog levels

Because this setting affects all team members' view of the team backlogs and boards, you must be a team administrator to change the setting. Changing the setting is disabled if you're not a team administrator. To get added as a team administrator, see [Add team administrator](add-team-administrator.md).

You can change the setting from a backlog or board view. Here we show how to change it from the board view.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 

1.  [Open your Kanban board](../../boards/boards/kanban-quickstart.md). If you're not a team admin, [get added as one](add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can customize the Kanban board.

2. Select **Configure team settings** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-gear.png" border="false"::: to configure the board and set general team settings.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Open board settings for a team, vert nav](media/configure-team/open-board-settings.png)  

4. Choose **Backlogs** and check the boxes of those backlog levels you want your team to manage. 

	![Team settings dialog, Backlogs tab](media/select-nav-backlog-levels-config-ts.png)  

5. When done with your changes, choose **Save and close**.  

6. To see the changes, open or refresh your team's [backlog](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).
