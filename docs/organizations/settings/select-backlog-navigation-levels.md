# Select backlog navigation levels for your team

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2015-on.md)]  

Each team can determine the backlog levels that they use. For example, feature teams may want to only focus on their product backlog, while a management team may choose to only show feature and epics (the two default portfolio backlogs). You configure which backlog levels appear from your team settings dialog. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 
If you want additional portfolio backlogs, see the following topics based on the process model you use: 
- **Inheritance**: [Customize your backlogs or boards for a process](work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)  
- **Hosted XML**: [Add portfolio backlogs](../../reference/add-portfolio-backlogs.md).  

For an overview of process models, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../../reference/customize-work.md).

If you want additional portfolio backlogs, see [Add portfolio backlogs](../../reference/add-portfolio-backlogs.md).

## Set your team's preferences for backlog levels

Because this setting affects all team members' view of the team backlogs and boards, you must be a team administrator to change the setting. Changing the setting is disabled if you're not a team administrator. Go [here to get added as a team administrator](add-team-administrator.md).

You can change the setting from a backlog or board view. Here we show how to change it from the board view.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 

1.  [Open your Kanban board](../../boards/boards/kanban-quickstart.md). If you're not a team admin, [get added as one](add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can customize the Kanban board.

2. Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/blue-gear.png) gear icon to configure the board and set general team settings.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

2. Choose **Backlogs** and check the boxes of those backlog levels you want your team to manage.
