# Define Iteration Paths (aka sprints) and configure team iterations 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You add Iteration Paths to support teams who implement Scrum or use sprint planning to group work items based on a time-box interval or sprint. You define Iteration Paths at the project level and then each team selects the ones they want to be active for them under the team configuration. You can create a flat iteration path structure or a hierarchy of paths to support releases, sub-releases, and sprints. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Area Paths and Iteration Paths are also referred to as *Classification Nodes*. You can manage them programmatically via the [Classification Nodes (REST API)](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/classification-nodes) or the Azure DevOps CLI commands, [az boards area (Azure DevOps CLI)](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/boards/iteration) and [az boards area (Azure DevOps CLI)](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/boards/iteration).

Each team has access to a number of Agile tools as described in [About teams and Agile tools](about-teams-and-settings.md). Each tool references the team's default area path(s). Several tools reference the team's default and selected Iteration Paths or sprints. Most teams choose one Area Path and several Iteration Paths to support their work tracking activities. However, to support other scenarios, it's possible for teams to choose several Area Paths to appear on their backlogs and boards. 

Newly created projects contain a single, root Area Path that corresponds to the project name. You add Area Paths under this root. Also, each project typically specifies a predefined set of Iteration Paths to help you get started tracking your work. All you need to do is specify the dates. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-selector.md)]

## Prerequisites

<a name="permissions"></a>

- You add Iteration Paths to a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one now](../projects/create-project.md).
- To add an Iteration Path under the root node or edit or delete any child node, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** group. To acquire these permissions, see [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).  
- Or, to add, edit, and manage Iteration Paths under a node, you must have one or more of the following permissions set to **Allow** for the node you want to manage: **Create child nodes**, **Delete this node**, and **Edit this node**, and **View permissions for this node**.  By default, the user who created the project has these permissions set. To learn more, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path).  
- To set team Iteration Paths, you must be [added as the team administrator](add-team-administrator.md) or be a member of the **Project Administrators** group.  

For naming restrictions on Iteration Paths, see [About areas and iterations, Naming restrictions](about-areas-iterations.md#name-restrictions).

## Get started sequence

If you are new to managing projects and teams, the most straight forward sequence for configuring iterations for your project and teams is as follows:  

1. Define the Area Paths and teams following the guidance provided in [Define area paths and assign to a team](set-area-paths.md#guidance).  
2. Determine the length of the iteration you want to support. Recommended practice is to have all teams use the same sprint cadence. For guidance, review [About areas and iterations](about-areas-iterations.md).
3. Determine if you want a flat structure or hierarchy of sprints and releases.
4. Open **Project settings > Project configuration** and define the Iteration Paths to support steps 2 and 3 at the project level. Follow the steps provided later in this article: [Open Project Settings, Project configuration](#open-project-settings) and [Add iterations and set iteration dates](#iterations). 
5. Open the team configuration and assign the default and additional Area Path(s) to each team. Follow the steps provided later in this article: [Open team settings](#open-team-settings) and [Set team default iteration path(s)](#activate).
6. Each team should assign the default Iteration Path they selected to their work items. This is needed in order for those work items to show up on their product backlogs and boards. Use [bulk modify](../../boards/backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md) to modify several work items at once. See also [Assign backlog items to a sprint](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md). 
As needed, you can perform the following actions at any time: 

      - Add additional child iteration nodes
      - Rename an Iteration Path (except the root path)
      - Move a child Iteration Path under another node 
      - Delete a child Iteration Path 
      - Change the default and selected Iteration Paths assigned to a team

<a id="default_path">  </a>

## Backlog iteration versus default iteration 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"
Teams can set a default iteration different from the backlog iteration. The backlog iteration determines which items appear on the team's backlogs and boards. And, the default iteration determines what value is assigned to work items created from the team context. 

All work items that you create from your team context are automatically assigned both the team's default area path and default iteration path.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015"

For TFS 2015 and earlier versions, the default iteration is the same as the backlog iteration. The one value selected both filters items that appear on the team's backlogs and boards, and is assigned to work items created from the team context.

1. Open the **Iterations** tab for the project context. 

	For Scrum-based projects, you'll see these set of sprints. 

	<img src="../../boards/sprints/_img/activate-team-sprints.png" alt="Example Iterations for a Team" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

	You can change the name, location within the tree hierarchy, or set dates for any sprint. Simply open it (double-click or press Enter key) and specify the info you want.

2. Schedule the start and end dates for those sprints you plan to use. 

	<img src="../../boards/sprints/_img/set-sprint-start-end-dates.png" alt="Define start and end dates for a sprint" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

	After you set the start and end dates for one iteration, the calendar tool automatically attempts to set the next set of dates, based on the same iteration length you specified for the first. For example, if you set a three week sprint for Sprint 1, then when you select the start date for Sprint 2, the calendar tool automatically determines the start and end dates based on the next three weeks. You can accept or change these dates.  

3. To add another sprint, select **New child** and name it what you want. Here, we call it Sprint 7.

> To enable the new user interface for the Project Permissions Settings Page, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. Open **Project settings > Team configuration > Iterations** for a team.  

   Here, we navigate to the **FabrikamFiber Team**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Project settings > Team Configuration > Iterations page](_img/team-defaults/open-team-settings-iterations-preview.png)  

2. **Backlog iteration**. Only work items assigned to an iteration equal to or under this backlog iteration appear in the team's backlogs and boards. 

	![Work, Iterations page for team, set team backlog iteration for backlogs and boards](_img/team-defaults/stdefaults-team-backlog-iteration-preview.png)

	Also, all work items added through a team's backlog or board are assigned the backlog iteration. 

3. **Default iteration**. The default iteration defines the iteration used when a new work item is created from the team's context (Dashboard, Queries, Backlog). You can use an explicit value or use <strong>@CurrentIteration</strong> to assign new work items to the team's current iteration. This is the same macro used in [queries to list work items assigned to the currently active iteration assigned to the team](../../boards/queries/query-by-date-or-current-iteration.md#current-iteration).  

	For example, you might want all new work items to be added to a future iteration path which you use to triage and assign to specific sprints at periodic intervals.  

	![Work, Iterations page for team, set team default for new work items](_img/team-defaults/stdefaults-team-default-iteration-preview.png)

4. **Active sprints**. Add an iteration for each sprint backlog you want active for the team. Add each sprint, one by one, by selecting it from the menu.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Work, Iterations page for team, select sprints](_img/team-defaults/select-iterations.png)

                                   [--start-date]

```

#### Parameters
 
- **path**: Required. Absolute path of an iteration. Example: \ProjectName\Iteration\IterationName.  
- **child-id**: Optional. Moves an existing iteration path and adds it as a child node for the specified path name or path ID.  
- **name**: Optional. New name of the iteration path.  
- **project**: Optional. Name or ID of the project. Example: --project "Fabrikam Fiber".  
- **finish-date**: Optional. Finish date of the iteration. Example : "2019-06-21".
- **start-date**: Optional. Start date of the iteration path. Example: "2019-06-03". Must be earlier than the finish-date.
- **yes**: Optional. Do not prompt for confirmation.
 
#### Example 

For example, the following command updates the start and end dates of the Sprint 3 iteration path for the Fabrikam Fiber project. 

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```CLI
C:\WINDOWS\system32>az boards iteration project update --path "\Fabrikam Fiber\Iteration\Release 1\Sprint 3" --finish-date 2019-08-31 --start-date 2019-08-01 --project "Fabrikam Fiber" --output table

## Archive iteration paths 

After a while, you may want to archive iteration paths that were used for sprints that are a year or more out of date. You can do that by moving the iteration path under a node that you label "Archive". All work items are updated with the moved iteration path. Also, teams can de-select those sprints that have past. All data is maintained in the data store with the new iteration path assignments. 

<!--- Implications for reporting --> 
Prior to archiving the iterations, consider if you have captured all the reports that you may want. 

::: moniker-end

## Chart progress by iteration

You can quickly generate [queries](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) to view the progress for those areas. As an example, you can [visualize progress of work items assigned to sprints](../../report/dashboards/charts.md) as shown in the following stacked bar chart.  

![Stacked bar chart by area](_img/areas/ALM_CW_StackedBarChart.png) 

## Q & A 

### Q: Do I have to assign iteration paths to a team?  

**A:** If your team doesn't use sprints to plan and track work, then no. You can leave the defaults assigned to the team as they are. You can then use the product and portfolio backlogs and boards, however you won't be able to gain much use of sprint planning tools.
