# Rename or remove a team  

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

As your organization changes, you may need to rename or remove a team.  

When you rename a team, the new name propagates throughout Azure DevOps. The following team artifacts are automatically renamed:
- Team security group 
- Team backlogs and boards
- Team dashboards 
 
> [!TIP]    
> Update any queries that reference the old team security group name. 

When you remove or delete a team, all of its configuration settings get deleted. These settings include team dashboards, backlogs, and boards. Data defined for work items that are assigned to the team are left unchanged. Once deleted, you can't recover the team configurations. 
 
## Prerequisites 

- To rename a team, you must be a team administrator or a member of the [**Project Administrators** group](../security/(../security/change-project-level-permissions.md)
- To remove or delete a team, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** group.
