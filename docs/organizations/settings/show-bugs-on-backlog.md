# Show bugs on backlogs and boards  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

As your team identifies code defects or bugs, they can add them to the backlog and track them similar to requirements. Or, they can schedule them to be fixed within a sprint along with other tasks. 
 
When you track bugs as requirements, they'll show up on the product backlog and Kanban board. When you track bugs similar to tasks, they'll show up on the sprint backlogs and task boards. If you want to track additional work item types (WITs) or custom WITs on your backlogs or boards, you can. See [Add other work item types to backlogs or boards](#add-other-wits) later in this topic.

## Set your team's preferences for tracking bugs  

You can change the setting from a backlog or board view. Here we show how to change it from the board view.

In the **Working with bugs** dialog, you can select from the following three options.

* Choose the first option when your team wants to manage bugs similar to requirements. Bugs can be estimated and tracked against team velocity and cumulative flow. Bugs will be associated with the Requirements category.  

* Choose the second option when your team wants to manage bugs similar to tasks. Remaining work can be tracked for bugs and tracked against the sprint capacity and burndown. Bugs will be associated with the Task category. 

* Choose the last option if your team manages bugs separate from requirements or tasks. Bugs will be associated with the Bugs category.

## Nested items  

> [!TIP]  
> If, after refreshing a backlog or board, and you don't see bugs where you expect them, review [How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items](../../boards/backlogs/resolve-backlog-reorder-issues.md). Only leaf nodes of nested items will appear on the Kanban or task boards.   

When you manage bugs with requirements or with tasks, they'll show up on one or more of your Agile tool backlogs and boards. However, if you nest items&mdash;create parent-child links of items that belong in either the Requirements or Task categories&mdash;then not all items may appear on your backlogs and boards. To learn more about how nested items are treated, see [How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items](../../boards/backlogs/resolve-backlog-reorder-issues.md).

## Add other work item types to your backlogs or boards

Bugs are a common item that teams want to track, and choose how they track it. See [Manage bugs](../../boards/backlogs/manage-bugs.md) for more guidance. 

However, what if you want to track other work item types (WITs) on your backlogs and boards?  

::: moniker range="vsts"  
You can add other WITs&#8212;such as change requests, issues, or impediments&#8212; by customizing your process or project, based on the process model you use. For details,  
- For the Inheritance process model, see [Customize your backlogs or boards for a process](work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md).   
- For Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models, see [Add a work item type to a backlog and board](../../reference/add-wits-to-backlogs-and-boards.md).
