> [!NOTE]  
> When you change a project to use an inherited process, you may find one or more Agile tools or work items appear in an invalid state. For example: 
> 
> - If you make a field required, work items with that field undefined show an error message. You'll need to resolve the errors to make additional changes and save the work item. 
> - If you add or remove/hide workflow states of a WIT that appears on the Kanban board, you'll need to update the Kanban board column configurations for all teams defined in the  project.
