> [!NOTE]   
> As you customize an inherited process, all projects that use that process are updated automatically to reflect the customizations. For this reason, we recommend that you create a test process and test project when you have a number of customizations to make in order to test the customizations prior to rolling them out to your organization. To learn more, see [Create and manage inherited processes](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/manage-process).
