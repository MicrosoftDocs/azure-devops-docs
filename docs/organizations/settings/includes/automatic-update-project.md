> [!NOTE]   
> When you customize an inherited process, any projects using that process automatically reflect the customizations. To ensure a smooth transition, we recommend creating a test process and project, which allows you to test your customizations before you implementing them organization-wide. For more information, see [Create and manage inherited processes](../work/manage-process.md).
