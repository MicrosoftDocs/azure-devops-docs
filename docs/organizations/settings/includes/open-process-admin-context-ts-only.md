1. Then, choose **Process**. 
   
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Organization Settings, Process page](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/media/process/open-process-page-s150.png) 

	> [!IMPORTANT]  
	> If you don't see **Process**, then you're working from TFS-2018 or earlier version. The **Process** page isn't supported. You must use the features supported for the [On-premises XML process model](../../../reference/customize-work.md).
