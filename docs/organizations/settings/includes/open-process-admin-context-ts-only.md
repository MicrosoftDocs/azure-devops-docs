Create, manage, and make customizations to processes from the  **Process** page.

2. Select ![gear icon](../../media/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

   > ![Screenshot showing highlighted Organization settings button.](../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)  

3. Select **Process**. 
   
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Organization Settings, Process page](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/media/process/open-process-page-s150.png) 

	> [!IMPORTANT]  
	> If you don't see **Process**, then you're working from an earlier version where the **Process** page isn't supported. Use the features supported for the [On-premises XML process model](../../../reference/customize-work.md).
