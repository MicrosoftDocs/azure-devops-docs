## Apply the customized process to your project 

After you've verified your customizations, you can now apply the process to your existing project. 

> [!TIP]    
> As you customize a WIT, all projects that reference the inherited process that you're customizing automatically updates to reflect the custom WITs you've added. To view your customizations, refresh your web browser.
