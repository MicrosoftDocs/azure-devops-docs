Backlogs and boards are essential Agile tools for creating and managing work for a team. The standard backlogs&mdash;product, iteration, and portfolio&mdash;inherited from the system process are fully customizable. In addition, you can add custom portfolio backlogs for a total of five portfolio backlogs.

**What you can't customize**  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

- You can't remove an inherited portfolio level from the product (but you can rename the portfolio level and you can disable an inherited work item type)
- You can't insert a backlog level within the existing set of defined backlogs
- You can't reorder the backlog levels  
- You can't add a work item type to two different backlog levels  
- You can't create a custom task backlog level, although you can add custom WITs to the iteration backlog  
- You can't add the *Bug* WIT to any backlog level. Instead, the system allows each team to decide how they want to manage bugs. To learn more, see [Show bugs on backlogs and boards](../show-bugs-on-backlog.md).
