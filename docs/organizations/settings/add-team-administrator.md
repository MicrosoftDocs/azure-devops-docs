# Add a team administrator 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]


<a id="add-team-admin">  </a>  

It's always a good idea to have more than one person with administration permissions for an area. You need to be a team administrator to [Manage teams and configure team tools](manage-teams.md). 

As a team administrator, you can configure, customize, and manage all team-related activities for your team. These include being able to add team members, add team admins, and configure Agile tools and team assets.

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="vsts"
* You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md). 
* You must be a [member of the Project Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md), or a team administrator for the team you want to update.

To get added as a team administrator, ask another team admin, the organization owner, or a member of the [Project Administrators group](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) to add you.  

If you need to add a team, see [Add teams](add-teams.md).
