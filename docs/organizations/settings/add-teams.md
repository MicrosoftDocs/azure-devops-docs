# Add a team, move from one default team to several teams

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

As your organization grows, make sure that you configure your Agile tools to support that growth. Each team needs their own set of team tools to enable the autonomy it needs to manage their backlog and plan their sprints. For more information about features assigned to teams, see [About teams and Agile tools](about-teams-and-settings.md). 

> [!NOTE]    
> This article describes how to add a team or team members to a project defined in Azure DevOps. To learn about Microsoft Teams, see the Marketplace extension, [Microsoft Teams Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsts.vss-services-teams). 
>
> For a good understanding on how to remain Agile as you add teams, review the [Scale Agile to Large Teams](/azure/devops/learn/agile/scale-agile-large-teams) article.

As your team grows, you can easily move from one team to two. In this example, we add two feature teams, Email and Voice, and maintain the Fabrikam Fiber team with visibility across each of these two teams.  

## Prerequisites 

- If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../projects/create-project.md).  
- If you're not a Project Administrator, [get added as one](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). Only members of the Project Administrators group can add and delete teams.   

## Add two feature teams 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!NOTE]   
> To enable the new user interface for the **New Teams Page**, see [Enable preview features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

Add and configure two teams, Email and Voice. Here we show you how to add and configure the Email team. 

1. From the web portal, choose **Project settings** and open **Teams**. 

   ![Open Project settings, and then Teams](_img/_shared/open-project-settings-teams-preview.png)

2. Choose **New team**. Give the team a name, and optionally a description. 

	> ![Create a subteam with its own area path](_img/add-team/create-new-team-preview.png)

3. Select the team to configure it. To select the set of sprints and area paths the team plans to use, choose **Iterations and areas** See [Define area paths and assign to a team](set-area-paths.md) and [Define iteration paths (also known as sprints) and configure team iterations](set-iteration-paths-sprints.md). 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Team profile, choose Iterations and areas link](_img/add-team/team-profile-choose-iterations-and-areas.png)

	> [!IMPORTANT]  
	> Team tools aren't available until the team's default area path is set. If you haven't created one or more Area Paths for the team to use, then [do that now](set-area-paths.md). Area Paths must be created for the project first, then assigned to the team. 

	From the team profile, you can do these additional tasks:  
   - [Add team administrators](add-team-administrator.md)
   - [Add team members](#add-team-members)
   - [Navigate to team notifications](../../notifications/howto-manage-team-notifications.md)
   - [Navigate to and set default team dashboard permissions](../../report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions.md)

To configure other team features, see [Manage teams and configure team tools](manage-teams.md).

## Add team members

If you're moving from one team to two teams, team members already have access to the project. If you're setting up a team structure for the first time, adding user accounts as team members provides access to the project and team assets. Access to the project is required to support sharing code and planning and tracking work. 

Several Agile tools, like capacity planning and team alerts, and dashboard widgets are team-scoped. That is, they automatically reference the user accounts of team members to support planning activities or sending alerts. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  

> [!NOTE]   
> You must first [add a user to a project or to your organization](../accounts/add-organization-users.md) or [set up your account to work with Azure AD](../accounts/access-with-azure-ad.md). This way you can add user identities to a team.

::: moniker-end 


::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

::: moniker-end 

For details, see [Add users to a project or specific team](../security/add-users-team-project.md). 


## Move work items under teams 

Now that your two feature teams are configured, you need to move existing work items from their current assignments to the team's default area path. This way, the work items show up on each team's backlog. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

#### [Preview page](#tab/preview-page) 

1. The quickest way to do this, is to [create a query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) of all work items you want to reassign, multi-select those items belonging to each team, and [bulk edit the area path](../../boards/backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md).

   ![Web portal, Queries page, Bulk modify select work items](_img/add-team/query-bulk-edit-area-path.png)

2. After you bulk modify, do a bulk save.  
  
   ![Bulk save edited work items](_img/add-team/query-bulk-save.png)

#### [Current page](#tab/current-page) 

1. The quickest way to do this, is to [create a query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) of all work items you want to reassign, multi-select those items belonging to each team, and [bulk edit the area path](../../boards/backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md).

   ![Bulk save edited work items](_img/add-team/query-bulk-save.png)

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

<a id="move-work-items" /> 

You can move work items to a new area paths using [az boards work-item update](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/boards/work-item#ext-azure-devops-az-boards-work-item-update).  

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```CLI

<a id="grant-add-permissions"></a>  

## Grant team members additional permissions  

For teams to work autonomously, you may want to provide them with permissions that they don't have by default. Suggested tasks include providing team administrators or team leads permissions to:  

- Create and edit child nodes under their default area path
- Create and edit child nodes under an existing iteration node 
- Create shared queries and folders under the Shared Queries folder

For more information on setting the above permissions or restricting access for select users, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018 <= azure-devops-2019" 

If your Azure DevOps Server or TFS deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you'll need to [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports to team members](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md). 

::: moniker-end 

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2017" 

If your TFS deployment is integrated with a SharePoint product or SQL Server Reports, you'll need to manage membership for those products separately from their websites. 

-  [Set SharePoint site permissions](../security/set-sharepoint-permissions.md) 
-  [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports in TFS](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).

## Next steps

Once you've created a team, you'll want to configure your Agile tools to support how your team works. Also, consider adding one or more users as team administrators. Team administrators have the necessary permissions to add team members, add a picture to the team profile, and configure and manage all team features.
