# Create or add a team 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]


 As your organization grows, you add teams to support that growth.  You create a team in Azure DevOps that corresponds to a group of project members focused on specific products, services, or feature areas. You add teams to provide them the tools they need to manage their backlog, plan sprints, configure dashboards, define alerts, and set team favorites.  

Each new project is configured with a default team with the project name. For example, the project named Fabrikam Fiber is configured with the default team Fabrikam Fiber Team. You can rename the default team and you can reassign a new team as the default.  

For a good understanding on how to remain Agile as you add teams, review [Scale Agile to Large Teams](/devops/plan/scaling-agile). For more information about team-configurable tools, see [About teams and Agile tools](about-teams-and-settings.md). 


> [!NOTE]    
> This article describes how to add a team or team members to a project defined in Azure DevOps. To learn about Microsoft Teams or the integration of Microsoft Teams with Azure Boards, see [Welcome to Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-overview) or [Use the Azure Boards app in Microsoft Teams](../../boards/integrations/boards-teams.md). 

Use this article to learn how to perform the following tasks:

> * Set the default team for a project

To move work items assigned to one team to another team, see [Move work items from one team to another](../../boards/work-items/move-work-items.md).

## Prerequisites 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
- To create a team or set the default team, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** group. See [Change project-level permissions](../security/change-project-level-permissions.md). Only members of the Project Administrators group can add and delete teams.   
- To add members to a team or change its configuration, you must be a team administrator or member of the Project Administrators group. To get added as a team administrator, see [Add or remove a team administrator](add-team-administrator.md).
- To use Azure CLI commands, you must first install Azure CLI as described in [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).

## Create a team and add team members

From your web browser, you can view, create, and configure teams. Only members of the Project Administrators group can create teams.

> [!NOTE]   
> When you create a team, you can automatically create the **Area Path** the team will use as a child node of the main project node. If you plan on creating a hierarchical team structure, you may want to first define the **Area Paths** at the project level, then create your teams, and then assign the **Area Path(s)** to be used by each team. To learn more about this team structure, see [Configure a hierarchy of teams](../../boards/plans/configure-hierarchical-teams.md).

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

From the Azure CLI tool, you can [list teams](#list-teams), [create a team](#add-team), [update a team configuration](rename-remove-team.md#update-team), and [delete a team](rename-remove-team.md#delete-team).

Upon creation of a team, the following items are automatically configured:  
- Security group with the team name containing the members assigned to the team, for example, **[Fabrikam Fiber]\Production Planning**. You can use this name to filter queries or to **@mention** all members of the team. 
- Default notifications assigned to the team. To learn more, see [Manage notifications for a team, project, or organization](../../notifications/manage-team-group-global-organization-notifications.md).
- Default dashboard named **Overview** assigned to the team. To configure the dashboard, see [Add widgets to a dashboard](../../report/dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> Configuring the **Area Paths** and **Iteration Paths** used by the team is essential for many of the Azure Board tools to work, such as Backlogs, Boards, Sprints, and Delivery Plans. Team tools aren't available until the team's default area path is set. **Area Paths** and **Iteration Paths** are first configured for the project and then assigned or selected by the team.  
>
> If you are moving from one team to two or more teams, you may want to review and revise the **Area Paths** assigned to the default project team. 


To configure other team features, see [Manage teams and configure team tools](manage-teams.md).

<a id="include-area-paths"> </a>  

## Set the default project team

Each project has a default team assigned. You can change which project is assigned as the default with the following procedures.   

#### [New Teams UI](#tab/preview-page) 
::: moniker range="azure-devops"
1. Open **Project settings > Teams** as indicated in the previous section. 

1. Choose :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: **More options** for the team you want to designate as the default, and choose **Set team as project default**. 

	 ![Screenshot of Teams page, More options menu selection, New Teams Page enabled.](media/add-team/set-team-project-default-new-ui.png)  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
Choose the **Current UI** tab. The New Teams Page UI is only available for Azure DevOps Services. 
::: moniker-end

#### [Current UI](#tab/current-page) 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 
1. Open **Project settings > Teams** as indicated in the previous section. 
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2018" 
1. Open **Project Settings > Overview** as indicated in the previous section. 
::: moniker-end 
1. Choose :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: to open the context menu for the team you want to designate as the default, and choose **Set team as project default**. 

	 ![Screenshot of Teams page, More options menu selection, New Teams Page enabled.](media/add-team/set-team-project-default-current.png)  

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 
There isn't an Azure CLI command to set the default team project.

<a id="list-teams" /> 

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

## List teams with Azure CLI

You can list teams using [Azure DevOps team list](/cli/azure/devops/team#az-devops-team-list). To learn how to list team members, see [Add users to a team or project, List team members](../security/add-users-team-project.md#list-members).

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```azurecli
az devops team list [--project]
                    [--skip]
                    [--top]
```

> [!TIP]
> If you don't specify a **top** number, 100 teams are returned. To list all teams in a project, specify a number for **top** which is greater than the current number of teams defined.  

#### Parameters

- **project**: Optional. Name or ID of the project. Example: --project "Fabrikam Fiber".  You can configure the default project using `az devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID`. Required if not configured as default or picked up via git config.
- **skip**: Optional. Number of teams to skip.  
- **top**: Optional. Maximum number of teams to return. 

#### Example

For example, the following command returns the 11 teams defined in the Fabrikam Fiber project. For addition output formats, see [Output formats for Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli). 

Each team is assigned a unique ID. 

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```azurecli
az devops team list --project "Fabrikam Fiber" --output table
```

The table output listed below provides information on each of the attributes defined for the team.

<a id="grant-add-permissions"></a>  

## Grant team members additional permissions  

For teams to work autonomously, you may want to provide them with permissions that they don't have by default. Suggested tasks include providing team administrators or team leads permissions to:  

- [Create and edit child nodes under their default area path](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#create-child-nodes-modify-work-items-under-an-area-or-iteration-path) 
- [Create shared queries and folders under the **Shared Queries** folder](../../boards/queries/set-query-permissions.md)

For more information on setting permissions and access for select users, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022" 

If your deployment is integrated with SQL Server Reports, you need to [Grant permissions to view or create SQL Server reports to team members](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports).
