> [!IMPORTANT]   
> You can only use the Inheritance process model for projects defined on a project collection configured to support the Inheritance process model. If your on-premises collection has been configured to use the On-premises XML process model, you can only use that process model to customize the work tracking experience. To learn more, see [Customize work tracking, Choose the process model for your project collection](/azure/devops/reference/customize-work#choose-process-model&view=azure-devops-2019).  

To customize any project defined on a collection for TFS 2018 or earlier, see [On-premises XML process model](/azure/devops/reference/on-premises-xml-process-model).
