## Prerequisites
* You must have an organization created in Azure DevOps Services. If you haven't created one yet, [do that now](/azure/devops/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates).  
* You must be a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group, the organization owner, or be granted explicit permissions to edit, create, or manage a specific process and to create a project. 

	If you aren't a project administrator, [get added as one](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions). Or, have someone provide you with explicit permissions to [Edit or Create a specific process and Create new projects](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking#process-permissions).
