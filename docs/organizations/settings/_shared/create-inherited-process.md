## Create an inherited process 

The first step is to create an inherited process that you can customize. The default, system processes are locked from being customized. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. From the **Process** page, open the **&hellip;** context menu of the process you'll use to create an inherited process, and then choose **Create inherited process**. Choose the same system process&mdash;[Agile](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process), [Basic](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/track-issues-tasks), [Scrum](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process), or [CMMI](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process)&mdash;that was used to create the project that you want to customize.
