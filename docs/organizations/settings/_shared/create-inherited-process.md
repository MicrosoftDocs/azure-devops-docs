## Create an inherited process 

The first step is to create an inherited process that you can customize. The default, system processes are locked from being customized. 
  
0. From the **Process** page, open the **&hellip;** context menu of the process you'll use to create an inherited process, and then choose **Create inherited process**. Choose the same system process&mdash;[Agile](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process), [Scrum](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process), or [CMMI](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process)&mdash;that was used to create the project that you want to customize. 

	Here, we create an inherited process from the Agile system process.

0.	Enter a name for your process and optionally a description. Process names must be unique and no more than 128 characters. For additional restrictions, see [Create and manage inheritance processes, Process name restrictions](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/manage-process#process-naming). Optionally, add a description.
