## Open Settings>Process

1. Then, Choose **Process** under **Boards**. 
   
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Organization Settings, Process page](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/_img/process/open-process-page-s150.png) 

	> [!IMPORTANT]  
	> If you don't see **Process**, then you're working from an on-premises TFS. The **Process** page isn't supported. You must use the features supported for the On-premises XML process model as described in [Customize your work tracking experience](/azure/devops/reference/customize-work).
