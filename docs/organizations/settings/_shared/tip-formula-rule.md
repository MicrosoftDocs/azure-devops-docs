> [!TIP]    
> You can't define a formula using a rule. However, you may find a solution that fits your needs via the [TFS Aggregator (Web Service) Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tfsaggregatorteam.tfs-aggregator-web-service). See also [Rollup of work and other fields](../../../reference/xml/support-rollup-of-work-and-other-fields.md).
