# Define area paths and assign to a team

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]


You can add area paths to support teams and to group work items based on product, feature, or business areas. Then, define area paths at the project level and assign them to a team under the team configuration. You can also create a hierarchy of area paths to support subcategories within categories.

> [!NOTE] 
> Area Paths and Iteration Paths are also referred to as *Classification Nodes*. You can manage them programmatically via the [Classification Nodes (REST API)](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/classification-nodes), or the Azure DevOps CLI commands and [az boards area (Azure DevOps CLI)](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/boards/iteration).

Each team has access to a number of Agile tools as described in [About teams and Agile tools](about-teams-and-settings.md). Each tool references the team's default area path(s). Most teams choose one area path and several iteration paths to support their work tracking activities. However, to support other scenarios, it's possible for teams to choose several area paths to appear on their backlogs and boards.

New projects contain a single, root area that corresponds to the project name. A team is created with the same project name and the root area path is assigned to that team.  

To understand how the system uses area paths, see [About area and iteration paths](about-areas-iterations.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-selector.md)]

## Prerequisites

<a name="permissions"></a>

- Add Area Paths to a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one now](../projects/create-project.md).
- Ensure you're a member of the **Project Administrators** group to add an Area Path under the root node or edit or delete any child node. To acquire these permissions, see [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).
- Have one or more of the following permissions set to **Allow**,  to add, edit, and manage Area Paths under a node:

    - **Create child nodes**
    - **Delete this node**
    - **Edit this node**
    - **View permissions in this node**

  By default, the user who created the project has these permissions set. To learn more, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#set-permissions-area-path).
- Ensure you're [added as a team administrator](add-team-administrator.md) or are a member of the **Project Administrators** group to set team Area Paths.  

For naming restrictions on Area Paths, see [About areas and iterations, Naming restrictions](about-areas-iterations.md#name-restrictions).

<a id="guidance" />

## Get started sequence

If you're new to managing projects and teams, the most straight forward sequence for configuring your project and teams is as follows:

1. Determine the number and names of Area Paths that you want to support to categorize your work. At a minimum, you'll want to add one Area Path for each team that you'll define. For guidance, review [About areas and iterations](about-areas-iterations.md).
2. Determine the number and names of teams you want to support. For guidance, review [About teams and Agile tools](about-teams-and-settings.md).
3. Open **Project settings>Project configuration** and define the Area Paths to support steps 1 and 2 at the project level. Follow the steps provided later in this article: [Open Project Settings, Project configuration](#open-project-settings) and [Add area paths](#add-areas).
4. Define the teams you need to support step 2. For guidance, see [Add a team, move from one default team to several teams](add-teams.md).  
5. Open the team configuration and assign the default and additional Area Path(s) to each team. Follow the steps provided later in this article: [Open team settings](#open-team-settings) and [Set team default area path(s)](#team-area-paths).
6. Assign the Area Path of work items to an area path you defined. Use [bulk modify](../../boards/backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md) to modify several work items at once.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"

> [!NOTE]
> While you can assign the same area path to more than one team, this can cause problems if two teams claim ownership over the same set of work items. To learn more, see [About boards and Kanban, Limitations of multi-team Kanban board views](../../boards/boards/kanban-overview.md#limits-multi-team).

::: moniker-end

As needed, you can do the following actions at any time:

- Add additional child nodes
- Rename an Area Path (except the root area path)
- Move a child node under another node
- Delete a child node
- Rename a team
- Change the Area Path assignments made to a team

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Team Profile, choose Iterations and area](_img/team-defaults/team-profile-choose-iterations-areas.png)   

3. If you need to switch the team context, use the team selector within the breadcrumbs.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Team Configuration, Team breadcrumb](_img/team-defaults/select-team-context.png) 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"  

You open team settings from the top navigation bar. Select the team you want and then choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/gear_icon.png) gear icon. To learn more about switching your team focus, see [Switch project, repository, team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md#switch-team-context)

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

<a id="list-team-area-paths" /> 

You can list the area paths defined for a team using [az boards area team list](/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/boards/area/team#ext-azure-devops-az-boards-area-team-list). To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).  

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```CLI
az boards area team list --team
                         [--project] 
```

#### Parameters

- **team**: Required. Name or ID of the team.
- **project**: Optional. Name or ID of the project. Example: --project "Fabrikam Fiber".  

For example, the following command lists the area paths for the Service Delivery team. For other output format options, see [Output formats for Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli)

## Set team area path(s)

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"  

All work items assigned to the area paths selected for a team appear on the backlogs and boards for that team. You can select one or more area paths and optionally include their sub-area paths.  Choose to include sub-area paths when you want to support rollup views of work performed across several teams or areas.

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015"  

All work items assigned to the area paths selected for a team appear on the backlogs and boards for that team. You can select a single area path, and optionally include their sub-area paths. Choose to include sub-area paths when you want to support rollup views of work performed across several teams or areas. 

::: moniker-end  

The default area path determines the default area path assigned to work items that are created from the team context.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Work items that appear on more then one team's Kanban board can yield query results that don't meet your expectations. Because each team can customize the Kanban board [columns](../../boards/boards/add-columns.md) and [swimlanes](../../boards/boards/expedite-work.md), the values assigned to work items which appear on different boards may not be the same. The primary work around for this issue is to maintain single ownership of work items by team area path.   

#### [Browser](#tab/browser)

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"  

1. Open **Areas** for the team context.  

   Here, we show the Areas for the Fabrikam Fiber team.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Area page for team](_img/team-defaults/open-areas-fabrikam-team.png)

2. Choose the area path(s) to be active for each team.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Work, Iterations page for team](_img/team-defaults/stdefaults-add-area-paths.png)  

    In this instance, we choose to activate all three sub-area paths for the project. The management team can now track progress across all three teams.  

    ![Multiple area paths assigned to team](_img/team-defaults/stdefaults-set-team-area-paths-management-team-team-services-list.png)  

2. When you've finished, refresh the product backlog page for the team, and you'll see those work items assigned to the team. Add Area Path to the columns shown to see the assignments made to work items.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Backlog view of default team](_img/add-team/product-backlog-default-team-horz.png)  

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015"  

1. Open the Areas admin page for the team context.  

    Here, we navigate to the Fabrikam Fiber team. The checked box indicates the area paths selected for the team. To exclude sub-areas, select the option from the area path context menu.  

    ![Work, Area page for Fabrikam Fiber team](_img/team-defaults/stdefaults-open-team-area-page-tfs.png)  

1. Refresh the product backlog page for the team, and you'll see only those work items assigned to the Fabrikam Fiber area path.

## Chart progress by area

You can quickly generate [queries](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) to view the progress based on an area path. For example, [visualize progress of work items that are assigned to each team's area path](../../report/dashboards/charts.md), as shown in the following stacked bar chart. Choose Node Name to get the leaf node of the Area Path.

## Q & A

### Q: Do I have to assign an area path to a team?

**A:** No. You assign area paths to teams so that the work items assigned to that area path appear on the team's backlogs and boards. By default, all work items are assigned to the root area path and show up in the default team that's defined for the project.
