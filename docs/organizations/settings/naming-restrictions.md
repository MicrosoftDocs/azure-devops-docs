# Naming restrictions and conventions  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]  

Most components in Azure DevOps must follow naming restrictions and conventions. Restrictions help guarantee a consistent user experience and provide compatibility with other applications.  

Common restrictions include not exceeding the character length for a name, not containing special characters, and maintaining uniqueness of names within an object set.


## Computers, accounts, groups, and collections

<a id="CommonRestrictions">   </a>
### Common considerations 

The length restrictions in this article are measured by the number of Unicode characters permitted. Surrogate characters are composed of two Unicode characters, which count as two characters against the length restriction. For details, see [About Unicode and Character Sets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd317711.aspx). 

As with other operating system files, ASCII control characters (ASCII 1-31) and surrogate combinations are also not allowed. For general information about the operating system restrictions applied to file names, see [Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365247.aspx).

<a id="ComputerNames">   </a>

### Computer name 
<a id="computer-name">   </a>

When you install TFS, the computer name where you install TFS is associated with the name of the server.  
Both the operating system and Active Directory impose certain restrictions on computer names as described in these articles:  
*	[Rename the Computer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd894434.aspx)  
*	[Rename a Computer that Hosts a Stand-Alone Instance of SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms143799.aspx)  
*	[Windows Server Active Directory](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/909264)

<a id="AccountNames">   </a>
### User account names
User accounts identify people added to a project or project collection. These user accounts might correspond to an Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, Windows, or other user account types.  

You add existing user accounts. You can't create a user account. To add user accounts to a  project, see [Add users to a project or team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md) . 

User accounts that you add must conform to the following restrictions.

### Group name 

Groups enable you to apply certain rights or permissions to a group of users.

On-premises TFS groups can consist of Active Directory group accounts, TFS group accounts, Windows user accounts, Windows group accounts, or any mixture of these types. See [Manage users or groups in TFS](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).  

Groups that you add must conform to the following restrictions.

<a id="ProjectCollectionNames">   </a>

## Project collections 

A project collection identifies a group of projects and the resources that are associated with those projects. It provides an organizing structure that you can use to define and control a group of projects within TFS.  

Also, the collection name is part of the connection string used to connect team members to projects. The default assigned corresponds to *DefaultCollection*. 
[Manage project collections](/azure/devops/server/admin/manage-team-project-collections) provides more information. 

Names you assign to project collections must conform to the following restrictions.

### Process and process templates 

A process defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and other subsystems you access when you connect to a project.  

> [!NOTE]   
>  **Terminology note**: Both "process" and "process template" refer to an interdependent set of files used to create a project. [Choose a process](../../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md) describes the differences among the three default processes available to you.   

Processes you define or customize must conform to the following restrictions.

<a id="Kanban">   </a>

### Kanban boards 

Your [Kanban board](../../boards/boards/kanban-basics.md) turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work. 

Customize your Kanban boards by adding, removing, or renaming [columns](../../boards/boards/add-columns.md) and [swimlanes](../../boards/boards/expedite-work.md). Columns support the flow of work across the board. Swimlanes allow you to manage different classes of work as horizontal lanes on the board.

Column and swimlane names must conform to the following restrictions.

<table>

<a id="TeamNames">   </a>

### Teams 
Team names identify a group of individuals or groups that collectively work together as a team in a project. Team members use this name to connect to the team or to query against members defined for a team. 

As such, team names must conform to conventions that allow them to be rendered as part of a valid URL. Each team name must be unique within a single project. However, there aren't any restrictions on using the same team name in different projects within a project collection. [Add another team or a hierarchy of teams](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md) provides more information about working with teams.  

Team names must conform to the following restrictions.

<a id="WorkItems">   </a>

## Work items, work item types, and customizations

You use work items to capture information to plan and track your software development projects. With work items, you can describe the work to be done, assign work, track status, and coordinate efforts within your team. Different types of work items&mdash;such as user stories, tasks, bugs, and issues&mdash;track different types of information.  

All work item tracking objects are associated with one or more names. Most have friendly display names, except work item types and global lists, are associated with reference names. A friendly name is a unique, user-visible identifier for a field. Using friendly names ensures consistency across projects and work item types in a project collection. The system uses the reference name internally and you cannot change it after it is defined.  

There are restrictions on several elements that are associated with work items, including reference and friendly names, field names, and attachment size.  

You can [modify or add a custom work item type (WIT)](../../reference/add-modify-wit.md) to support your team's processes. 

### Attachments  

Files attached to work items must conform to the following restrictions.  

<table>

</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


### Area Path and Iteration Path 

Two work item fields, **Area Path** and **Iteration Path**, provide a tree structure hierarchy for grouping work. Area paths group work items by product, functional, or feature area. Iteration paths group work items into sprints, milestones, or time periods for addressing those work items.

These multi-node fields use the backslash (&#92;) characters to denote the hierarchy of nodes within the tree structure.  

The names you assign to child nodes to these fields must conform to the following restrictions.  

<table>

### Field names, work item tracking

Each work item type (WIT) definition contains one or more work item fields. These fields define the information stored for work items based on the WIT. A work item field name uniquely identifies each work item field.  

Work item field names that you add must conform to the following restrictions.  
<table>

</table>

### Field, link type, and category reference names 

Define a reference name whenever you add or create a work item field, link type, or category. Each work item field has an associated field reference name. The field reference name uniquely identifies each field and can't be changed after it's assigned.  

All reference names can be up to 70 Unicode characters long.  

Define a reference name by using alphanumeric characters, underscore characters, and hyphen characters. Each reference name must contain at least one period (.), but no period can appear at the start or end of a name. A reference name can't start with a number or an underscore, and it can't have multiple consecutive hyphens, such as (--).  

Work item field reference names that you add must conform to the following restrictions.

**Field reference names and portability** 

The work item type definition language includes the concept of a *field reference name*. Field reference names can help you to port definitions between Team Foundation project collections and also to allow third party integrations to find and refer to specific fields. These names are globally unique, just as a namespace in the .NET Framework application is globally unique.  

Field reference names cannot be renamed. If for example, you changed the field name "Title" to "Header", the field reference name of that field remains the same. Integrations and internal representations of fields should use the field reference name instead of depending on the field name itself.  
 
The System namespace is used only to define all core system fields that are mandatory for Team Foundation system functions. Team Foundation Server prevents you from creating your own System.X field because it might impede Team Foundation Server functionality.  

The Microsoft namespace is used to define work item tracking fields. These fields are defined in a work item type definition of the TFS process templates. TFS does not prevent you from creating your own Microsoft.X field. However, this practice is discouraged because it might impede TFS functionality or the ability for the Configure Features wizard to successfully update a project after an upgrade.   

Customers and partners can create their own field namespaces for custom work item types.  

For descriptions of system fields and fields defined in the default process templates, see [Index of work item fields](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).

<a id="ExamplesFieldReferenceNames">  </a>

### Field help text

You can specify help text for a WIT field by using the ```HELPTEXT``` element. The system displays this text at run time to help users know what to enter into the field. Help text is scoped to a specific WIT in a specific project. [Apply a rule to a work item field](../../reference/xml/apply-rule-work-item-field.md) provides information on adding help text.

### Global lists 

A global list is a set of list item values that you can use globally across all project collections within an instance of an on-premises TFS. As you define WITs, you may find that some work item fields share the same set of allowed or suggested values. Global lists enable you to define these values one time and share them across multiple WITs and projects. See [Define global lists](../../reference/xml/define-global-lists.md) for details.

A global list, defined using the ```GLOBALLIST``` element contains one or more list items, specified using the ```LISTITEM``` element.

```LISTITEM``` names must conform to the following restrictions.  
<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Restriction type</th>
<th>Restriction</th>

<tr>
<td>
<p>Length</p>

## Team Foundation Build   

Team Foundation Build lets you manage all the aspects of the build process on a single computer. By using Team Foundation Build, you can synchronize the sources, compile the application, run associated unit tests, perform code analysis, release builds on a file server, and publish build reports.

### Build computer 

Team Foundation Build is a separate installation from the TFS application tier, data tier, or Visual Studio client. You may choose a separate computer. Otherwise, you can install the build side-by-side on the client computer or on the servers.  

Your on-premises build computer must conform to the following restrictions.  

<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Restriction type</th>
<th>Restriction</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disk space
</td>
<td>
Must contain sufficient space for the build (insufficient space leads to failed builds).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Build directory</p>
</td>
<td>Must be a local path (for example, <em>C:\BuildDirectory</em>).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Drop location directory</td>
<td>
Must be a UNC path (for example, <code>\\server\share</code>).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Drop location permissions</p>
</td>
<td>Each generated build is put in a new directory in the drop folder.
<ul>
<li>
The Team Foundation Server Service account (for example, <em>Domain</em>&#92;TFSSERVICE) must have Full Control permission access to the UNC drop location.
</li>
<li>The UNC drop location must be a shared folder.
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Team Foundation Build Service account</p>
</td>
<td>
If you change the TFS Service account after the initial installation, you must make sure that the following conditions are true.
<ul>
<li>The account is a member of the Build Services group.
</li>
<li>The account has read/write permissions to the temporary folders and the ASP.NET temporary folder.
</li>
<li>The account has Full Control permission to the build directory and drop location.
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Firewall issues</p>
</td>
<td>
If the build computer is firewall enabled, make sure that the program <strong>tfsbuildservice</strong> is in the exceptions list.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Build types

Build types configure the conditions under which a single solution or a set of solutions in a project are built. To conduct a build, you must either create a new build type or use an existing [build type](../../pipelines/get-started-designer.md).

Build type names  must conform to the following restrictions.  

<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Restriction type</th>
<th>Restriction</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Uniqueness</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Must not be the same as any other build type name in the project</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Special characters</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Must not contain the following printable character: $</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Build quality 

The build quality lets you attach a quality level or completion state to a completed build. Team Foundation Build also lets you create new values for the [build quality type](../../pipelines/get-started-designer.md). See [Rate the quality of a completed build](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181734.aspx) for a list of the default build quality values.

Build quality names must conform to the following restrictions.  

<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Restriction type</th>
<th>Restriction</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Length</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Must not contain more than 256 Unicode characters</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Uniqueness</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Must not be the same as any other Build Quality name in the Team Foundation Build computer</p>

### TFVC names and paths
 
Team Foundation version control (TFVC) provides a central repository for files and the commands that are required to manage those files across a team. It also provides customizable check-in policies, branching, merging, shelving, and many other features.

Version control paths must conform to the following restrictions. See also [Optimize your workspace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181378.aspx).

In the web portal and REST API certain operations (Edit, Rename, and Delete) have a more restrictive path length than Visual Studio and TF.exe clients.  This is due to web portal/REST utilizing a randomly generated workspace for concurrency when pending the changes.
<table>

## TFVC Labels

In Team Foundation version control (TFVC), a label is a name applied to a specific set of revisions. You can attach labels to a set of unrelated files in version control, which lets you retrieve the files or act upon them as a group. The following table describes the restrictions put on label names.

<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Restriction type</th>
<th>Restriction</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Length</p>
</td>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Must not contain more than 64 Unicode characters</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Special characters</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can't end with a space ( ) or period (.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must not contain the following printable characters: &#92; &#47; &quot;  : &lt; &gt;  | &#42; ? @ ; </p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
