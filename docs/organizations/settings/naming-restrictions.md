# Naming restrictions and conventions  

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]  

Most components in Azure DevOps must follow naming restrictions and conventions. Restrictions help guarantee a consistent user experience and provide compatibility with other applications.  
Common restrictions include not exceeding the character length for a name, not containing special characters, and maintaining uniqueness of names within an object set.

> [!NOTE]   
> For limits on the number of items you can define, see [Work tracking, process, and project limits](work/object-limits.md).

<a id="CommonRestrictions">   </a>

## General considerations 

The length restrictions in this article are measured by the number of Unicode characters permitted. Surrogate characters are composed of two Unicode characters, which count as two characters against the length restriction. For details, see [About Unicode and Character Sets](/windows/win32/intl/about-unicode-and-character-sets). 

As with other operating system files, ASCII control characters (ASCII 1-31) and surrogate combinations are also not allowed. For general information about the operating system restrictions applied to file names, see [Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces](/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file).

<a id="reserved" />

### System reserved names 

Most names you assign should avoid inclusion of system reserved names. These names correspond to: 

- AUX 
- COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, COM10
- CON 
- DefaultCollection
- LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9
- NUL  
- PRN 
- SERVER, SignalR 
- Web or WEB 
 

For more information about reserved names, see [File Names, Paths, and Namespaces](/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file).

## Azure Boards 

<a id="WorkItems"/>
<a id="work-items-work-item-types-and-customizations"/>

You use work items to capture information to plan and track your software development projects. With work items, you can describe the work to be done, assign work, track status, and coordinate efforts within your team. Different types of work items&mdash;such as user stories, tasks, bugs, and issues&mdash;track different types of information.  To learn more, see [Azure Boards documentation](../../boards/index.yml).

All work item tracking objects are associated with one or more names. Most have friendly display names, except work item types and global lists, which are associated with reference names. A friendly name is a unique, user-visible identifier for a field. Using friendly names ensures consistency across projects and work item types in a project collection. The system uses the reference name internally and you can't change it after it's defined.  

There are restrictions on several elements that are associated with work items, including reference and friendly names, field names, and attachment size.  


### Area and iteration paths 

Two work item fields, **Area Path** and **Iteration Path**, provide a tree structure hierarchy for grouping work. Area paths group work items by product, functional, or feature area. Iteration paths group work items into sprints, milestones, or time periods for addressing those work items.

These multi-node fields use the backslash (&#92;) characters to denote the hierarchy of nodes within the tree structure.  

The names you assign to child nodes to these fields must conform to the following restrictions.  


[!INCLUDE [area-iteration-paths](includes/name-restrictions/area-iteration-paths.md)] 


### Attachments  

Files attached to work items must conform to the following restrictions.

:::row-end:::


<a id="Kanban" />

### Board column and swimlane names 

Your [Kanban board](../../boards/boards/kanban-basics.md) turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work. 

Customize your Kanban boards by adding, removing, or renaming [columns](../../boards/boards/add-columns.md) and [swimlanes](../../boards/boards/expedite-work.md). Columns support the flow of work across the board. Swimlanes allow you to manage different classes of work as horizontal lanes on the board.

Column and swimlane names must conform to the following restrictions.

<a id="WorkItemFields">   </a>

### Field names 

Each work item type contains one or more work item fields. These fields define the information stored for work items based on the work item type.  Each work item field has an associated field reference name. The field reference name uniquely identifies each field and can't be changed after it's assigned. For more information about out-of-box work item fields, see [Work item field index](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md). 

Work item field names must conform to the following restrictions.

#### Field reference names and portability  

The work item type definition language includes the concept of a *field reference name*. Field reference names can help you to port definitions between Team Foundation project collections and also to allow third-party integrations to find and refer to specific fields. These names are globally unique, just as a namespace in the .NET Framework application is globally unique.  

Field reference names cannot be renamed. If for example, you changed the field name "Title" to "Header", the field reference name of that field remains the same. Integrations and internal representations of fields should use the field reference name instead of depending on the field name itself.  
 
The System namespace is used only to define all core system fields that are mandatory for Team Foundation system functions. You're prevented from creating your own System.X field because it might impede functionality.  

The Microsoft namespace is used to define work item tracking fields. These fields are defined in a work item type definition of the process templates. You're not prevented from creating your own Microsoft.X field. However, we discourage creating your own field because it might impede functionality or the ability for the Configure Features wizard to successfully update a project after an upgrade.   

Customers and partners can create their own field namespaces for custom work item types.  

For descriptions of system fields and fields defined in the default process templates, see [Index of work item fields](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).

<a id="ExamplesFieldReferenceNames">  </a>
    
#### Examples of field reference names  

The following examples show valid field reference names, in various namespaces. Customers and partners can also define their own namespaces to support their custom work item types.

### Field help text

The system displays help text at run time to help users know what to enter into the field. Help text is scoped to a specific work item type in a specific project. 

For the Inheritance process, you specify help text for a field through the **Edit field** dialog, **Definition** tab, **Description**. See [Add a custom field to a work item type](work/add-custom-field.md). For the On-premises XML process, you specify help text by using the ```HELPTEXT``` element. See [Add or modify a field to track work](../../reference/add-modify-field.md#add-rules-to-a-field).

Help text that you add must conform to the following restrictions.

### Global lists 

A global list is a set of list item values that you can use globally across all project collections within an instance of an on-premises TFS. As you define WITs, you may find that some work item fields share the same set of allowed or suggested values. Global lists enable you to define these values one time and share them across multiple WITs and projects. See [Define global lists](../../reference/xml/define-global-lists.md) for details.

A global list, defined using the ```GLOBALLIST``` element contains one or more list items, specified using the ```LISTITEM``` element.

```LISTITEM``` names must conform to the following restrictions.

### Link type and category reference names 

Define a reference name whenever you add or create a link type or category. All reference names can be up to 70 Unicode characters long.  

Define a reference name by using alphanumeric characters, underscore characters, and hyphen characters. Each reference name must contain at least one period (.), but no period can appear at the start or end of a name. A reference name must not start with a number or an underscore, and it can't have multiple consecutive hyphens, such as (--).

## Azure Repos (TFVC) 
 
Team Foundation version control (TFVC) provides a central repository for files and the commands that are required to manage those files across a team. It also provides customizable check-in policies, branching, merging, shelving, and many other features. To learn more, see [Azure Repos TFVC documentation](../../repos/tfvc/index.yml)

Version control paths must conform to the following restrictions. See also [Optimize your workspace](../../repos/tfvc/optimize-your-workspace.md).

In the web portal and REST API, certain operations have a more restrictive path length than Visual Studio and TF.exe clients. These operations include Edit, Rename, and Delete, and occur because the web portal/REST uses a randomly generated workspace for concurrency when pending the changes.

### TFVC files

The version control system stores many different types of files. [Set up Team Foundation version control on your dev machine](../../repos/tfvc/set-up-team-foundation-version-control-your-dev-machine.md) provides details on how to add existing Visual Studio projects or solutions.

Files and folders you add to Team Foundation version control must conform to the following restrictions.

### TFVC Labels

In Team Foundation version control (TFVC), a label is a name applied to a specific set of revisions. You can attach labels to a set of unrelated files in version control, which lets you retrieve the files or act upon them as a group. The following table describes the restrictions put on label names.

### TFVC workspaces

A workspace is a client-side copy of the files and folders in Team Foundation version control (TFVC). When you create multiple workspaces, you can have different versions of the same version control folder on a client computer. [Create and work with workspaces](../../repos/tfvc/create-work-workspaces.md) provides more details.

## Process and process templates 

A process defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and other subsystems that you have access to after connecting to a project.  

> [!NOTE]   
>  **Terminology note**: Both "process" and "process template" refer to an interdependent set of files used to create a project. [Choose a process](../../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md) describes the differences among the three default processes available to you.   

Processes you define or customize must conform to the following restrictions.

## Project collections 

A project collection identifies a group of projects and the resources that are associated with those projects. It provides an organizing structure that you can use to define and control a group of projects defined for an Azure DevOps Server.  

Also, the collection name is part of the connection string used to connect team members to projects. The default assigned corresponds to *DefaultCollection*. 
[Manage project collections](/azure/devops/server/admin/manage-project-collections) provides more information. 

Names you assign to project collections must conform to the following restrictions.

## Team Foundation Build   

Team Foundation Build lets you manage all the aspects of the build process on a single computer. By using Team Foundation Build, you can synchronize the sources, compile the application, run associated unit tests, perform code analysis, release builds on a file server, and publish build reports.

### Build computer 

Team Foundation Build is a separate installation from the Azure DevOps Server application tier, data tier, or Visual Studio client. You may choose a separate computer. Otherwise, you can install the build side by side on the client computer or on the servers.  

Your on-premises build computer must conform to the following restrictions.

## Team names 

Team names identify a group of individuals or groups that collectively work together as a team in a project. Team members use this name to connect to the team or to query against members defined for a team. 

As such, team names must conform to conventions that allow them to be rendered as part of a valid URL. Each team name must be unique within a single project. However, there aren't any restrictions on using the same team name in different projects within a project collection.
