# Auditing events list

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Auditing is still in public preview.

The following tables describe the type of events (or actions) that are available for auditing through the Azure DevOps Auditing feature.

[!INCLUDE [important-backed-by-azure-active-directory](includes/important-backed-by-azure-active-directory.md)]

* Identify the *Product Area* for any given event. Refer to the full list in the [Area table](#areas).
* Determine the *Category* field of an event to understand the type of action performed. See the list of possible action types in the [Categories table](#categories).
* Find the list of all possible actions grouped by *Product Area* in the [Actions section](#actions).

> [!NOTE]
> We try our best to keep adding new actions regularly. If you'd like to see an event that isn't currently in the following tables, consider sharing that with us in the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/search?space=21).
