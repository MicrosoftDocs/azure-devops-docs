# Why did I get this email

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

If you get a notification email that you didn't expect, it could be for one of the following reasons:

* The email is sent to a group of which you're a member
* An unexpected subscription triggered the email

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-project-member-only](../../includes/prerequisites-project-member-only.md)]

Do the following tasks to determine if any resolve the issue:

## Inspect the 'To:' line on the email

Your email address or a group address appears on this line. If you receive unexpected emails, you might be part of a group receiving the email. The subscription administrator maybe configured the email delivery preferences to a wider group than intended.

## Inspect the footer of the unexpected email

All emails have a footer containing a link to view the subscription that triggered the email. Select the link to view the subscription. You received the email because you're subscribed to this subscription. If it's an organization or team subscription, you can opt out of it.
