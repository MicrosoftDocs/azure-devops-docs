# Change your preferred email address for notifications

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You can change your preferred email address for notifications from your organization preferences profile page. Notifications get sent by default to the preferred email address for your organization profile. This email address is typically the one you used to sign into Azure DevOps.
