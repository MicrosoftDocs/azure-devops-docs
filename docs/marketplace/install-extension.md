# Quickstart: Install extensions

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2015-on](../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2015-on.md)]

Add new features and capabilities to your organization by installing extensions.

In this quickstart, learn how to do the following tasks:

  - [Install extensions](#install-extension)
  - [Assign paid extensions to users](#assign-paid-extensions-to-users)

To learn about building your own Azure DevOps extensions, see [developing](https://aka.ms/vsoextensions) and [publishing](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-publish) extensions.

## Prerequisites

* Only [Project Collection Administrators or organization Owners](faq-extensions.md#find-owner) can install extensions. If you don't have permissions, you can [request extensions](request-vsts-extension.md) instead.
* Private extensions must be shared with your organization to be installed. Check out the [publishing documentation](../extend/publish/overview.md#upload) for information on how to share private extensions.

## Install extension

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).
2. Select the shopping bag icon, and then select **Browse Marketplace**.

   ![Select the shopping bag icon to browse the Marketplace](_img/shopping-bag-icon-browse-marketplace.png)

3.	Find the extension that you want to install.

4.	Select **Get** or **Get it free**.

    ![Get extension](_img/get-vsts-extensions/get-extension.png)

5.  For a paid extension, do the following tasks:
    1.  Select an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/) to use to pay for the extension access.
	
    ![Select an Azure subscription for billing](_img/get-vsts-extensions/select-azure-subscription.png)

    2. Select the number of users who need access.

6.  Select your organization from the dropdown menu, and then select **Install** to install the extension.

    ![Select organization for this extension](_img/get-vsts-extensions/select-install-extension.png)

   * [Why don't I see any organizations?](./faq-extensions.md#no-organizations) 

   * [Why can't I install this extension?](./faq-extensions.md#no-permissions) 

Your extension is now installed! You can now go to your organization to use your extension. Also, tell your team about this extension, so they can start using its capabilities too.

## Assign paid extensions to users

After you install a paid extension, assign it to your users so they can start using it.
To assign extensions, you need [Project Collection Administrator or organization Owner permissions](./faq-extensions.md#find-owner).

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

    ![Check that users have required access to extension assignment](_img/user-access-level.png)

   To find the access that your extension requires, see the extension's description in the [Marketplace > Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops).

5.	To assign the extension, highlight the user, choose **Manage projects**, and then select the **Extensions tab**.

    ![Select Manage projects to manage extensions](_shared/_img/select-manage-projects-to-manage-extensions.png)

6. Assign the extension and **Save changes**.

   Assign the extension to specific users up to the number allowed for free extensions or the number that you purchased for paid extensions.

Tell your team about this extension, so they can start using its capabilities.
