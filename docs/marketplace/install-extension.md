# Install extensions

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Install, assign, disable, and uninstall extensions, which add new features and capabilities for Azure DevOps.

For more information about extensions, see the [developing](../extend/overview.md) and [publishing](../extend/publish/overview.md) overviews.

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

- **Permissions:** Member of the Project Collection Administrators group. Organization owners are automatically members of this group. If you don't have permissions, you can [request extensions](./request-extensions.md) instead or [look up a project collection administrator](../organizations/security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md).
- **Extension sharing:** Private extensions [shared with your organization](../extend/publish/overview.md#share-your-extension).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

- **Permissions:** Member of the Project Collection Administrators group or **Edit collection-level information** permissions. Organization owners are automatically members of this group. If you don't have permissions, you can [request extensions](./request-extensions.md) instead or [look up a project collection administrator](../organizations/security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md).
- **Extension sharing:** Private extensions [shared with your organization](../extend/publish/overview.md#share-your-extension).

> [!NOTE]
> To use an existing Azure subscription for billing, have at least co-administrator permissions for that subscription. If you don't have permissions, an Azure Account Administrator or Service Administrator can [add you as co-administrator](/azure/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator) to the Azure subscription in the Azure portal.

Your project collection reuses your Azure subscription for future Marketplace purchases. [Where can I find more info about Azure billing?](faq-extensions.yml)

## Install an extension

Install an extension to your organization by doing the following steps.

#### [Browser](#tab/browser)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).
2. Select the shopping bag icon, and then select **Browse Marketplace**.

   ![Screenshot showing highlighted shopping bag icon and Browse Marketplace button selection.](media/shopping-bag-icon-browse-marketplace.png)

3. Find the extension that you want to install and select **Get it free**.

    ![Screenshot showing red square highlighting Get it free button.](media/get-vsts-extensions/get-extension.png)

4. Select your organization from the dropdown menu, and then select **Install** to install the extension.

    ![Select organization for this extension](media/get-vsts-extensions/select-install-extension.png)

   * [Why don't I see any organizations?](./faq-extensions.yml) 

   * [Why can't I install this extension?](./faq-extensions.yml) 

Your extension is now installed! You can now go to your organization to use your extension. Also, tell your team about this extension, so they can start using its capabilities.

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli/)

::: moniker range=" azure-devops"

Install an extension with the [az devops extension install](/cli/azure/devops/extension#az-devops-extension-install) command. To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../cli/index.md).

### Search for an extension

If necessary, first search for an extension with the `az devops extension search` command.

```azurecli
az devops extension search --search-query
```
#### Parameters

- **search-query**: Specify a term to search in the marketplace.

#### Example

The following command searches the marketplace for the term **Timetracker** and returns the *Publisher ID* and *Extension ID* in table format.  

```azurecli 
az devops extension search --search-query Timetracker --output table

Publisher Id    Extension Id    Name
--------------  --------------  -----------
7pace           Timetracker     Timetracker
7pacelabs       kitten          Kitten
```

### Install extension

```azurecli 
az devops extension install --extension-id
                            --publisher-id
                            [--org]
``` 

#### Parameters 

- **extension-id**: The name of the extension to install.
- **publisher-id**: The name of the extension publisher.
- **org**: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization using `az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`. Example: `--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.

#### Example 

The following command installs the **Timetracker** extension and shows the result in YAML format.  

```azurecli
az devops extension install --extension-id Timetracker --publisher-id 7pace --output yaml

```

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020 < azure-devops"

**Manual installation:**
1. Once you find an extension to install, use the following command to get it.

   `az extension add --name <extension-name>`

2. Replace `<extension-name>` with the actual name of the extension you want to install.
   - If the extension is from an external resource or you have a direct link to it, provide the source URL or local path.
  
   `az extension add --source <URL-or-path>`

   - You can also build a private extension index following the format in `index.json`, then set the extension index URL used by Azure CLI starting from version 2.20.0. After that, you can install the extension by name from the private extension index.

**Automatic installation (Dynamic install):**

When you run an extension command that isn’t installed, the Azure CLI recognizes the command you run and automatically installs the extension for you (starting from version 2.10.0). This feature, referred to as dynamic install, is enabled by default since 2.12.0. You can also enable it through configuration for previous supported versions:

`az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_prompt`

Use the following configuration command to enable dynamic install without a prompt:

`az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=yes_without_prompt`

Use the following configuration command to turn off the dynamic install feature to revert to the default behavior:

`az config set extension.use_dynamic_install=no`

The extension command returns a “command-not-found” error if the extension isn’t installed.

**Extension location:**

Once an extension is installed, you can find it under the value of the `$AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR` shell variable. If this variable is unset, by default the value is `$HOME/.azure/cliextensions` on Linux and macOS, and `%USERPROFILE%\\.azure\\cliextensions` on Windows.

::: moniker-end

### Troubleshoot extension installation

Follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve common issues:

- **Extension fails to install:**
  - **Check permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install extensions. You need to be a Project Collection Administrator or have the necessary permissions granted by an administrator.
  - **Verify extension compatibility:** Ensure the extension is compatible with your version of Azure DevOps. Check the extension's details page for compatibility information.
  - **Network issues:** Verify that your network connection is stable and that there are no firewall or proxy settings blocking the installation process.

- **Extension crashes or causes errors:**
  - **Collect diagnostic information:** If an extension crashes or causes errors, collect diagnostic information to help identify the issue. This information includes error messages, logs, and screenshots of the problem.
  - **Check extension logs:** Some extensions provide logs that can help diagnose issues. Check the extension's documentation for information on how to access and interpret these logs.
  - **Contact support:** If you can't resolve the issue, contact the extension's support team with the collected diagnostic information. Provide as much detail as possible to help them troubleshoot the problem.

- **Extension not visible after installation:**
  - **Refresh the page:** Sometimes, the extension might not appear immediately after installation.
  - **Check permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to view and use the extension. Some extensions might require specific permissions to be visible.
  - **Reinstall the extension:** If the extension still isn't visible, try uninstalling and reinstalling it.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)
### Q: Why don't I see my organization from the Marketplace installation page? 
A: If you don't see your organization when buying from the Azure DevOps Marketplace, try the following steps:
1. Check the identity that you use to sign in to the Visual Studio Marketplace. In the upper-right corner, select your user name to view your profile. 
1. Make sure your email address and directory are correct.
1. Close all browser windows.
1. Open a private or incognito browsing session.
1. Sign in to the Visual Studio Marketplace. Use the identity of a user in the organization that you want.

> [!TIP]
> Azure DevOps might ask you to choose between "work or school account" or "personal account". If so, then you used an email address that's the same for a Microsoft account and a "work or school account" that your organization manages in Microsoft Entra ID. Although these identities have the same email address, they're still separate identities with different profiles, security settings, and permissions.
> Choose the identity for the user in the organization that you want to select.
 
### Q: Why can't I install an extension?
A: You can't install extensions for one of the following reasons.  
- Be a member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../organizations/security/look-up-project-collection-administrators.md) or are the [**Organization owner**](../organizations/security/look-up-organization-owner.md). If you don't have permissions, but you're a project member, you can [request extensions](request-extensions.md) instead.
- For an "already installed or requested" error, check with your Project Collection Administrator and ask them to assign the extension to you.  

### Q: Why can't users access extension features?
A: Users can't access an extension for one of the following reasons.  
- Most extensions require that users have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder. For example, you can install the free [Code Search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search), but each user must have at least Basic access to search for code. To help your team improve app quality, you can install the free [Test & Feedback extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-exploratorytesting-web). You experience different capabilities, based on your access level and whether you work offline or connected to Azure DevOps Services or on-premises Azure DevOps Server. For more information, see the extension's description in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops), Azure DevOps tab.
- If you're using an organization and you started a free extension trial, your trial might be expired. Check whether your trial expired.
   1. On your organization toolbar, select **Users**.
   2. Go to the extension pane.
   3. Check for an expiration message to find if or when your extension expired.

- If you're using an organization and you paid for this extension, make sure that you assigned this extension to users.
   1. On your organization toolbar, go to **Users**.
   2. Go to the extension pane.
   3. Check whether the extension is assigned to the user. If it isn't, assign the extension to the user.

For more information, see [Assign extensions to users](../marketplace/install-extension.md).

### Q: What happened to my preview extension?
A: Your extension might be out of preview. After a preview period, an extension longer is generally available as a paid extension. A grace period might be offered before you have to buy the extension. All preview extensions automatically convert to a [free trial](../organizations/billing/try-additional-features-vs.md) before you have to buy the extension.

### Q: Why can't I install extensions for Azure DevOps Server?
A: You can't install extensions for Azure DevOps Server for one of the following reasons:
- Be a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group or have the **Edit collection-level information** permission set to **Allow** in the project collection where you want to install extensions. If you don't have permissions, you can [request extensions](./request-extensions.md) instead.
- You might get an error that says you already installed or requested the extension. If so, check with a member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group and ask them to assign the extension to you. For more information, see [Request an increase in permission levels](../organizations/security/request-changes-permissions.md).   
 
### Q: Why don't I see the project collection I want (on-premises)?
A: Be a member of your project collection. Follow these steps to check your identity that you use to sign in to the Marketplace.
1. On your Azure DevOps Server web portal home page (```https://{server}:8080/tfs/```), go to the top-right corner of the page, and select your user name to view your profile.
1. On the left side of your profile, make sure that your email address and directory are correct.
1. Close all browser windows.
1. Open a private or incognito browsing session.
1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps Server home page (```https://{server}:8080/tfs/```) with the identity that's a user in the project collection where you want to install the extension.

Azure DevOps might ask you to choose between a "work or school organization" or "personal account." This message means that you used an email address that's the same for a Microsoft account and a "work or school account" managed by your organization in Microsoft Entra ID. Although these identities have the same email address, they're still separate identities with different profiles, security settings, and permissions. Choose the identity that's the user in your project collection.

1. From your project collection, go to the Marketplace.

### Q: Why doesn't the extension that I want show a download button (on-premises)? 
A: Some extensions work only with Azure DevOps Services for one of the following reasons:  
- The extension uses Azure DevOps features that aren't released yet for Azure DevOps Server.
- The [extension manifest](../extend/develop/manifest.md) indicates that the extension is available only for Azure DevOps Services (targets = Microsoft.Visualstudio.Services.Cloud).
- The extension manifest indicates that the extension is an integration (targets = Microsoft.Visualstudio.Services.Integration).

### Q: Why can't I upload extensions to Azure DevOps Server?
A: Be a member of the [Team Foundation Administrators group](/azure/devops/server/admin/add-administrator#add-a-user-to-the-server-administrators-group). You must also have [**Edit instance-level information** permissions](../organizations/security/permissions.md#server) for the Azure DevOps Server where you want to upload extensions.
