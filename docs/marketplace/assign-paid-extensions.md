# Assign paid extension access to users

**VSTS** | **TFS**

After you install a paid extension, you must assign that extension to users who need access, so they can start using that extension's capabilities. 
To assign extensions, you'll need VSTS or TFS [project collection administrator or account owner permissions](./faq-extensions.md#find-owner).

> [!TIP]
> You only have to assign extensions to users who need access. If you have [Visual Studio subscribers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), 
> they automatically get access to specific extensions that are included with their subscriptions as benefits, like Test Manager. If you installed these extensions, you don't have to assign them to Visual Studio subscribers in your account.
