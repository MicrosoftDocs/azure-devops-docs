#### Q: What's the difference between free, preview, and paid extensions? 

Extensions that are available during preview don't incur charges, 
aren't fully supported, and have no financially-backed service level agreements. 

Paid extensions require that you buy and assign them to users 
who need access but don't have it already, for example, 
through subscription benefits. You'll use an 
[Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/) 
to pay for an extension. If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
you can create a new subscription when you install your extension. 
If you have multiple subscriptions, you can select the Azure subscription that you want to use.
