# Discover & manage extensions

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2015-on](../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2015-on.md)]

Extensions are simple add-ons that can be used to customize and extend your experience with Azure DevOps. The [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops) is home to hundreds of extensions that can be installed to help with the following tasks:

- Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, and so on
- Build and release flows
- Code testing and tracking
- Collaboration amongst team members

In this set of documentation, we focus on how to install and remove extensions. For information about building extensions for the Marketplace, see the [Develop extensions ](../extend/index.md) documentation.
