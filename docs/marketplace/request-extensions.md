# Request extensions

**Azure DevOps Services** | **TFS**

Don't have permissions to install extensions? You can request extensions instead.

0. Try to install the extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops), Azure DevOps tab.

1. Select the project collection (TFS) or project (Azure DevOps Services) where you want to install the extension. If you don't have permission to install the extension, you can request it now.

You can review your requests after the Visual Studio Marketplace sends the request to the project collection or project administrator.

Your requests appear on your manage extensions page.

Your project collection administrator can review your request after they get it.
