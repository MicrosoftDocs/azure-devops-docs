# Quickstart: Request and approve extensions

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2015-on](../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2015-on.md)]

If you don't have permissions to install extensions, you can request extensions instead. As a Project Collection Administrator, you get an email when another project member requests an extension. After you approve the request, the extension is automatically installed to Azure DevOps. In this article, learn how to do the following tasks:
  - [Request an extension](#request-an-extension)
  - [Approve extension requests](#approve-extension-requests)

## Prerequisites

- To request extensions, you must be a contributor for your organization
- To approve extensions, you must be a member of the Project Collection Administrators group or have [**edit collection-level information** permissions](../organizations/security/permissions.md#collection) set to *Allow*

## Request an extension

::: moniker range=" azure-devops"

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

2. Select ![gear icon](../_img/icons/gear-icon.png) **Organization settings**.

    ![Open Organization settings](../_shared/_img/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)

3. Select **Extensions**, and then **Browse marketplace**.

4. Select an extension to install.
5. If you don't have permission to install the extension, you can request it now.

Review your requests after the Marketplace sends the request to your Project Collection Administrator.

Your requests appear on the **Extensions** page, **Requested** tab.

## Approve extension requests

1. Go to your Azure DevOps or TFS home page, then go to your project:

   * Azure DevOps:```https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}```
   * TFS: ```https://{server}:8080/tfs/{team-project-collection}/{team-project}```

2. Select the shopping bag icon and **Manage extensions**.

3. Review and approve your requested extensions.
