This documentation focuses on discovering and installing extensions. Most extensions are available for free. 
For information on purchasing, see the following articles:
- [Azure DevOps billing overview](../organizations/billing/overview.md)
- [How to pay for TFS users](../organizations/billing/buy-access-tfs-test-hub.md)
- [How to buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions](/visualstudio/subscriptions/vscloud-overview)

## What are extensions?

Extensions provide new capabilities when they're installed in Azure DevOps. You can find extensions from within Azure DevOps or directly from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops), which is home to hundreds of extensions that can help you with the following tasks: 

- Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, and so on
- Build and release flows
- Code testing and tracking
- Collaboration with team members

Adding extensions to your organization can be quickly achieved with the following steps:

1. Search and find extensions for your organization in the [Marketplace > Azure DevOps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops).
2. Install the extension from the Marketplace and start using it in Azure DevOps.

To upload, install, or assign extensions you need [Project Collection Administrator or organization Owner permissions](./faq-extensions.md#find-owner).
