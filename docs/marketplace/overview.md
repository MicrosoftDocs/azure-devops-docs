[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2015-on](../boards/_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2015-on.md)]

Extensions are simple add-ons that can be used to customize and extend your experience with Azure DevOps. The [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops) is home to hundreds of extensions that can be installed to help with the following tasks:

- Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, and so on
- Pipeline build and release flows
- Code testing and tracking
- Collaboration among team members

In the Azure DevOps Marketplace you can do the following tasks:

- Discover and install extensions for Azure DevOps, Visual Studio, and Visual Studio Code
- Purchase Visual Studio subscriptions
