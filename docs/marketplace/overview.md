## What are extensions

An extension is an installable unit that contributes new capabilities into Visual Studio, VSTS, Team Foundation Server, or Visual Studio Code. You can find extensions from within these product or from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/). 

Extending VSTS is the easiest way for users to get the most out of their 
devops environment. The [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) is home to hundreds of extensions
that can be installed to help with:
- Planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, etc. 
- Build and release flows
- Code testing and tracking
- Collaboration amongst team members

Adding extensions to your VSTS account is incredibly easy:

1. Search and find extensions for your account in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com).
2. Install the extension from the Marketplace and start using it in VSTS.
You can install them with a few clicks. You must have administrative permissions to upload or install extensions.
