## What do I need to install an extension?
* Only VSTS [project collection administrators or account owners](faq-extensions.md#find-owner) can install extensions. If you don't have permissions, you can [request extensions](request-vsts-extension.md) instead. 
* Private extensions must be shared with your VSTS account to be installed. Check out the
[publishing documentation](../extend/publish/overview.md#upload) for information on how to share private extensions.
