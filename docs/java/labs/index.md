# About the Java Hands-on Labs

[Azure DevOps Services](https://dev.azure.com), [Azure DevOps Server](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tfs/), and [Team Foundation Server (TFS)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tfs/) provide an integrated set of services and tools to manage your software projects, from planning and development through testing and deployment to speed the development and delivery of your software applications across platforms, including iOS, Android, Java, Linux or Windows.


These hands-on labs are provided to give you a first-hand, technical experience on how you can leverage the Microsoft DevOps platform for Java development. The labs cover:

- Creating a new organization in Azure DevOps
- Using the Agile Boards to plan and track work items
- Using Azure DevOps Services with your Eclipse and IntelliJ
- Running Junit tests and analyzing code coverage with Jacoco and Cobertura
- Continuous Integration with Azure Pipelines or Jenkins
- Deploying Docker containers to Azure with an Automated delivery pipeline

## Virtual Machine

Our partner [NorthWest Cadence](https://www.nwcadence.com/) has built a virtual machine image that is pre-configured with all the software you require to run through the labs. You can find instructions on provisioning and connecting to the virtual machine [here](https://github.com/nwcadence/java-dev-vsts).

## Target Audience

The image and the accompanying hand-on-labs is for a technical audience. As such, familiarity with Azure DevOps Services, Java and Linux operating system would be preferred although it is not a strict prerequisite.

## Provisioning a project using Azure DevOps Demo Generator

You can use [Azure DevOps Demo Generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net) to provision a project with pre-defined data on to your organization to follow the hands-on-labs. Choose **MyShuttle2** template from the dropdown.
