If you don't know the URL to your VSTS account, the VSTS accounts you have access to will be listed at [https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com](https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com).

**Q: When I test the `tf` executable, I get a warning that the version detected is 0.0.0. How can I make it detect the actual version?**

**A:** This has been seen in version 14.0.3 and below of the TF Comand Line Tool when it defaults to not use English for the output. This has been fixed in the newer versions of the tool which can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/team-explorer-everywhere/releases).

**Q: How do I collect logs to help troubleshoot an issue?**

**A:** First enable logging for `com.microsoft.alm`, reproduce the issue and send us the `idea.log` file:
1. Help->Configure Debug Log Settings...
2. In the **Custom Debug Log Configuration** textbox, add the following on its own line:
    `com.microsoft.alm`
3. Click OK
4. Try to reproduce the issue you encountered.
5. Help->Show Log in Finder/Explorer/File Manager
6. The file `idea.log` should be highlighted.  You can open it with a text editor to review its contents for sensitive information and to make sure there are entries containing `microsoft`.
7. Compress the file.
8. Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vso-intellij/issues/new) and attach the file to it.
