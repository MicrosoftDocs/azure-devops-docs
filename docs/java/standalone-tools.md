# Use PMD, Checkstyle, and FindBugs with VSTS and TFS for Java development

Use [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/), [CheckStyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/), and [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) standalone static analysis during a Maven or Gradle build using TFS 2017+ or VSTS. 

## Enabling analysis

To use your these tools you simply check the corresponding checkbox in the **Static Analysis** section of a [Maven build task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/tasks/build/maven) or [Gradle build task](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/tasks/build/gradle).

## Reviewing the build summary and artifacts

The build summary reports the number of issues found by each of the tools you have activated.

Detailed issue logs are available under the build artifact tab of the build summary. If you analyze a multi-module Maven project, the results are split by module.

PDM, CheckStyle and FindBugs support for Maven and Gradle is currently available in VSTS  or TFS 2017 Update 1 or later.
