# Get started with Java DevOps and Azure DevOps

To quickly get going, follow these steps to create the accounts you'll need to use Azure DevOps Services.

## Create a Microsoft account

The first account you will need is a Microsoft account, otherwise known as a Live ID. If you already have one, such as a personal email address you use to log into Windows at school or home, you can use it. Otherwise, create a new one:

## Create an organization in Azure DevOps

Once you have a Microsoft account, you can create an organization. If you already have one, you can use it. Otherwise, create a new one:

## Create an Azure account

If you want to deploy your applications to Azure, you can use an existing Azure account or create a new one. A credit card is required for identity verification, but you will not be charged for the free trial, nor will your free trial become a paid account without your permission.

## Download a Git client

To work with Azure DevOps Services using Git, download a freely-available Git client for your operating system. If you already have a Git client, it should work fine with Azure DevOps Services.

[Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.

## Next steps

You are now ready to use the quickstarts, tutorials, and hands-on labs for implementing Java DevOps with Azure DevOps Services.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**Q: How many free organizations can I create and own?**
**A:** You can create multiple free organizations for every Microsoft Account you own.

**Q: How long does my free organization remain valid?**
