# Default permissions and access set for collaboration tools 

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**

Collaboration tools encompass READMEs, team project Wikis, notifications, feedback, and semantic search.  

Most of these tools are available to you if you are added as a team member or a member of the Contributors group for a team project. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. For a simplified view of all default permissions assigned to built-in groups, see [Default permissions and access](../security/permissions-access.md).  

Stakeholders have limited access to view charts and dashboards. To learn more, see [About access levels](../security/access-levels.md).

## Manage permissions

To manage permissions for a collaboration tool, see these topics:
- [Manage README & Wiki permissions (security)](manage-readme-wiki-permissions.md?toc=/vsts/collaborate/toc.json&bc=/vsts/collaborate/breadcrumb/toc.json)
- [Set feedback permissions](../feedback/give-permissions-feedback.md?toc=/vsts/feedback/toc.json&bc=/vsts/collaborate/feedback/toc.json )

To manage notifications, see: 
- [Manage personal notifications](../notifications/manage-personal-notifications.md?toc=/vsts/notifications/toc.json&bc=/vsts/notifications/breadcrumb/toc.json)
- [Manage team notifications](../collaborate/manage-team-notifications.md?toc=/vsts/notifications/toc.json&bc=/vsts/notifications/breadcrumb/toc.json) 

>[!NOTE]  
>There are no UI permissions associated with managing notifications. Instead, you can manage them using the [TFSSecurity command line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md#collection-level-permissions).
