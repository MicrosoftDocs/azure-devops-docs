# Version, select, or unpublish a published wiki

**VSTS**

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

When you publish a Git repository to a wiki, you can publish new branch versions of the repo, select a version to view, or unpublish the repo. 


::: moniker range="vsts"

## Publish a new wiki version 

When your published wiki corresponds to a product version, you can publish new versions as you release new versions of your product. To create a new version, create a new branch of your repo and then make updates to that new branch.

0. To create a new branch from the web portal, open the **Code>Branches** page, open the ![](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon for the branch you have previously published, and choose **New branch**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create a new branch](_img/wiki/publish-wiki-create-branch.png)

0. To Publish the new branch to a wiki, open the **Wiki** page for the currently published branch, open the ![](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon, and choose **Publish new version**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Publish new version menu option](_img/wiki/publish-new-version-option.png)

0. Fill out the form, choosing the branch that you previously created.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Publish new version dialog box](_img/wiki/publish-new-version.png)

0. Click **Update**. 

## Select a wiki version

To select a wiki version, choose the version from the branch options from your **Wiki** hub.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Select wiki version](_img/wiki/publish-wiki-select-version.png)

## Unpublish a published wiki

If you no longer want a repository to be published as a wiki, you can choose to unpublish it from the **Wiki** hub. Unpublishing a wiki unpublishes all versions of the repository that you have published previously. 

0. Simply select the wiki you want to unpublish, pen the context menu, and choose **Unpublish wiki**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Unpublish a wiki confirm dialog](_img/wiki/unpublish-wiki-code-option.png)

0. Confirm that you want to unpublish the wiki by choosing **Unpublish**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Select wiki version](_img/wiki/unpublish-wiki.png)
