# Integrate with service hooks

[!INCLUDE [Azure DevOps Services | Azure DevOps Server 2022 | Azure DevOps Server 2020](../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

You can use service hooks to run tasks on other services when events happen in your Azure DevOps project.

For example, you can use a service hook to automatically create a card in Trello when a work item gets created in Azure DevOps. Or you can automatically send a push notification to your team's mobile devices when a build fails. You can also use service hooks in custom apps and services as a more efficient way to drive activities when events happen in your projects.

## How do service hooks work?

Service hook **publishers** define a set of *events* that you can subscribe to. 
**Subscriptions** listen for these events and define **actions** to take based on events. 

Subscriptions also target **consumers**, which are external services that can run their own actions 
when events occur.

> [!NOTE]
> To use service hooks, you must allow specific IP address ranges for inbound connections to service endpoints. A service endpoint is a set of properties provided to a service hook. For more information, see [IP addresses and range restrictions](../organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url.md#range-restrictions).

## Create a subscription

To integrate one of these services with Azure DevOps, you create a subscription. In many cases, you also need to configure the target service. For detailed information, see the documentation for the service that you want to integrate.

1. Go to your project, select **Project settings**, and then select **Service hooks**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-devops-service-hooks.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an Azure DevOps project. On the side, Project settings and Service hooks are highlighted.":::

1. Select **Create subscription**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-devops-create-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Service Hooks page of an Azure DevOps project. The Create subscription button is highlighted.":::
 
1. Select the service that you want to integrate.

   :::image type="content" source="media/select-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Service dialog. Numerous services are listed, Trello is selected, and a description of Trello is visible.":::

1. Select the event to trigger on and any applicable filters.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/trello-wizard-event.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Trigger dialog. The Code pushed event is selected. Filters are set on a repository and a group.":::
 
1. Select an action to run on the target service. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > The available actions depend on the type of event that you select. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/trello-wizard-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Action dialog. Create a card is selected. Fields are available for specifying a token, a board, and other settings.":::

1. To confirm the settings are correct, test the subscription and then finish the wizard.

## FAQs

<a id="subscription-permissions"></a>

### Q: What permissions do I need to set up a subscription?

A: You need the *Edit subscriptions* and *View subscriptions* permissions. By default, only project administrators 
have these permissions. To grant them to other users directly, you can use a [command-line tool](../organizations/security/manage-tokens-namespaces.md) or the [Security](/rest/api/azure/devops/security/) REST API. 

To grant the *View* permission to a group, see [Set View permission for a group in service hooks](view-permission.md).

### Q: What are the security implications of granting Edit subscriptions and View subscriptions permissions?

A: A user who has the *Edit subscriptions* and *View subscriptions* permissions can:

- See all subscriptions in the project.
- See the notification history for all subscriptions in the project.
- Create any type of service hook subscription in the project.

If the user sets up a subscription for a resource that they don't otherwise have permission to access, the subscription doesn't get triggered. 

For example, suppose you create a subscription to send a notification when a work item in a specific area path gets updated. If you don't have access to the work items in that area path, the notifications don't get sent. However, if other users have access to the work items, you can see the notification history for subscriptions that alert them about updates.

### Q: Can I create service hook subscriptions for a project programmatically?

A: Yes. For more information, see [Create a service hooks subscription programmatically](create-subscription.md).

### Q: Can I remove an app's access to my organization after I authorize it?

A: Yes. You can revoke authorizations from your profile.

1. Go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). Select your profile photo, and then select **Visual Studio profile**.

   Make sure you start from the Visual Studio site, https://visualstudio.microsoft.com, when you manage authorizations. From that site, you can access the correct implementation of the authorizations management feature. Don't start from your organization (`https://dev.azure.com/{organization-name}`).

1. Select **Manage authorizations**.
	
	:::image type="content" source="media/Profile-manage-applications.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Visual Studio profile page with contact information for a user. In the Authorizations section, Manage applications is highlighted.":::
	
1. Revoke any authorizations you no longer want to allow.

	:::image type="content" source="media/authorizations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Authorizations dialog. A list of permissions is visible, and a Revoke link is highlighted.":::
	
### Q: Why can't I set up service hooks for HipChat anymore?

A: Atlassian no longer supports HipChat. For more information, see [Atlassian Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.atlassian.com/partnerships/slack/faq#faq-3ccc5a61-711b-4ef2-9ca2-3a34b2ec143b).
