# Integrate Azure DevOps Services with other applications

Service hooks enable you to perform tasks on other services when events happen in your Azure DevOps Services projects. For example, create a card in Trello when a work item is created or send a push notification to your team's mobile devices when a build fails. Service hooks can also be used in custom apps and services as a more efficient way to drive activities when events happen in your projects.
