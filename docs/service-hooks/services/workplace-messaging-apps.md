# Workplace Messaging Apps

These integrations help users to receive notifications in response to events in Azure DevOps within their workplace messaging apps like 
[Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Slack](https://slack.com). 
These integrations also help users to complete
workflows on Azure DevOps, such as allowing users to approve release deployments from their channels.

> [!NOTE]
