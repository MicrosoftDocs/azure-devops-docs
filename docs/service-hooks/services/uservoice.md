# UserVoice

Use User Voice to get feedback from your customers and push that feedback directly into your backlog in VSTS.
When your team updates the item in the backlog, the User Voice item is updated, too. 

Link your VSTS account to your UserVoice account.

1. If you don't have a UserVoice account, get one [here](https://www.uservoice.com/for/visual-studio-online/).

2. In UserVoice, go to the integrations page.

	<img alt="Uservoice settings menu, integrations" src="./_img/uservoice/uservoice-integrations-menu.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

3. Set up a synced service.

	<img alt="Uservoice settings dialog box, integrations tab, sync services link" src="./_img/uservoice/uservoice-sync-services.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

4. Sync to VSTS.

	<img alt="Uservoice settings dialog box, integrations tab, VSTS link" src="./_img/uservoice/sync-visual-studio-online.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

5. Link your VSTS account to your UserVoice account. 

	<img alt="Uservoice settings dialog box, integrations tab, link account link" src="./_img/uservoice/uservoice-link-account.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

	
6. Authorize UserVoice to access your VSTS account.

## Add an item to your backlog from a UserVoice idea

You can create a work item in VSTS form an idea in UserVoice.
In this case, we're creating a product backlog item. You might want to create a bug in some cases.
Or, if your team uses user stories instead of product backlog items, you can create those.

1. Open an idea in the admin area of UserVoice and then create a work item in Visual Studio.

	<img alt="Uservoice idea, settings menu, create work item" src="./_img/uservoice/uservoice-idea.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

2. Create the backlog item in VSTS.
The description you type here will be the description of the item in VSTS.

	<img alt="Create work item dialog box in Uservoice" src="./_img/uservoice/uservoice-create-work-item.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

3. Submit the idea. A link to the item in VSTS shows up on the UserVoice idea.

	<img alt="Uservoice idea with work item" src="./_img/uservoice/idea-with-work-item.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

4. Follow that link to open the backlog item in VSTS.

	<img alt="Work item in VSTS" src="./_img/uservoice/work-item.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

## Update a your backlog

When you update your backlog in VSTS, the UserVoice idea is updated, too.

1. Approve the backlog item.

	<img alt="Approved backlog item in VSTS" src="./_img/uservoice/approved-backlog-item.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

2. Add a comment in the history control.

	<img alt="Work item history" src="./_img/uservoice/work-item-history.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

3.In UserVoice, refresh the page and you'll see that the item was just updated
and that the comment added in the history control is displayed with the item in UserVoice.
Your customers can see that you're doing this work.

	<img alt="Updated work item in Uservoice idea" src="./_img/uservoice/updated-work-item.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

## Add comments to items in VSTS from UserVoice

1. In UserVoice, add a note to the linked VSTS item.

	<img alt="Uservoice add note dialog box" src="./_img/uservoice/add-note.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

2. In VSTS, refresh the work item to see the note in the discussion tab.

	<img alt="Work item discussion tab with note added" src="./_img/uservoice/work-item-discussion.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />
