# Create a service hook for Azure DevOps with Datadog 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Learn how to create events and metrics in Datadog in response to events from Azure DevOps. Use these metrics and events in Datadog to create dashboards, troubleshoot issues, and create monitors to alert you of critical issues. Datadog accepts all Azure DevOps event types.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Datadog feature may not be turned on by default for Azure DevOps Server 2019 and 2020. This is a known issue. Until it's resolved, you can use the following SQL command in your config database to turn on the feature:
`exec prc_SetRegistryValue 1, '#\FeatureAvailability\Entries\ServiceHooks.Consumers.datadog\AvailabilityState\', 1`

## Prerequisites

1. You must have *Edit subscriptions* and *View subscriptions* permissions. By default, only project administrators have these permissions. To grant the permissions to other users, you can use the command-line tool or the [Security](/rest/api/azure/devops/security/?view=azure-devops-rest-6.0&preserve-view=true) REST API.
2. If you don't have a Datadog account, [get started with Datadog](https://aka.ms/AzureDevOpsDataDog).
   a. In the Datadog application, go to [Integrations > API](https://aka.ms/AzureDevOpsDataDogAPI).
   b. Create a new key or select an existing one, and then copy the key to your clipboard. 

## Start sending Azure DevOps events to Datadog

1. Go to **Project settings** > **Service hooks**: `https://{orgName}/{project_name}/_settings/serviceHooks`.

2. Select **Create subscription**.

5. Configure the action to perform.
   - Paste (ctrl+v) your Datadog API Key into the required field.
   - Indicate whether your Datadog account is US or EU.

6. Choose **Test** to verify that Azure DevOps can use the provided configuration and successfully create a subscription.

7. Once verified, choose **Finish** to complete the creation of subscription.

8.	Repeat steps 2-7 for each event type you want to send to Datadog. Datadog accepts and encourages users to send all event types.
9.	Go to [Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/login) to see events and metrics start to flow into your environment.
