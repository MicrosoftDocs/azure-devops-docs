# Zendesk with VSTS
   
If you use Zendesk to support your customers, 
you can create work items in VSTS directly from your Zendesk tickets.
Then you can configure VSTS to update the Zendesk ticket when the work item is updated.

## Install the VSTS app for Zendesk

1. Download the .zip file that contains the VSTS for Zendesk app from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-zendesk-app).

2. If you don't have a Zendesk account, [get one](http://zendesk.com/).

3. Go to your Zendesk administration page to mange your apps.

4. Upload the VSTS for Zendesk app .zip file

   <img alt="Upload app button on Zendesk manage apps page" src="./_img/zendesk/zendesk-upload-app.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

5. Install and configure the app

   <img alt="VSTS for Zendesk installation page with the work item tag" src="./_img/zendesk/install.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

   If you use a work item tag, work items you create from Zendesk will have that tag. Later, you can use it to find items that were created from Zendesk.

## Authenticating

Each user of the app must provide credentials so that the VSTS app can create and query work items as that user. Creating a personal access token is recommended.

1. Navigate to the VSTS account you associated with your Zendesk account (from step 5 above)

2. Open the profile menu and select Security

   <img alt="Profile menu" src="./_img/zendesk/security-on-profile-menu.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" /> 

3. Create a personal access token
   
   <img alt="Zendesk ticket page, Apps button, login" src="./_img/zendesk/create-pat.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" /> 

   Suggestions:

   * Give the token a recognizable name so you can find it later if you need to revoke it or check its expiration date
   * Scope the token to the account associated with Zendesk
   * Limit to at least **Work item (read and write)**

4. Copy the token and paste it into the **Password** field of the VSTS app in Zendesk

   <img alt="Profile menu" src="./_img/zendesk/login.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

   * If you are running version 0.5.0 or higher of the app, you do not need to specify a Username. Otherwise, supply any value into the Username field (for example "**me**").

## Create a work item from Zendesk

1. Go to a ticket in Zendesk and log in to the VSTS for Zendesk app.

   <img alt="Zendesk ticket page, Apps button, login" src="./_img/zendesk/visual-studio-online-app-login.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

2. Add a work item to VSTS based on this ticket.

   <img alt="VSTS for Zendesk, new work item" src="./_img/zendesk/new-work-item.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

3. Create the work item.

   <img alt="Create work item dialog box" src="./_img/zendesk/create-work-item.jpg">

4. Open the work item in VSTS directly from Zendesk.

   <img alt="Zendesk ticket with work item" src="./_img/zendesk/ticket-with-work-item.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

   In VSTS, the work item is tagged with the tag you set up , and it's linked back to the ticket in Zendesk.

## Configure VSTS to update Zendesk tickets

Close the loop by configuring VSTS to update the Zendesk tickets whenever there's a change in the work items that were created from Zendesk.

1. Go to the your Zendesk API administration page.

   <img alt="Zendesk administration, APIs" src="./_img/zendesk/zendesk-apis.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

2. Enable token access and copy your token.

   <img alt="Channels/tokens with token access enabled" src="./_img/zendesk/token-access.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

0. Go to your VSTS project service hooks page: `https://{account_name}.visualstudio.com/{project_name}/_apps/hub/ms.vss-servicehooks-web.manageServiceHooks-project`

	![Team project administration page](./_img/add-service-hook.png)

	Click **Create Subscription**.

5. Start configuring Zendesk.

   <img alt="Sevice hooks tab, Zendesk selected" src="./_img/zendesk/target-service.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

6. Use the **Work item is commented on** event.
You can filter for comments, too.
For example, you can only act on comments that contain the string "Zendesk:"
and only those comments will be reflected back to Zendesk.

   <img alt="Configure the event dialog box with the tag set to Zendesk:" src="./_img/zendesk/configure-event.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

7. Configure the action that Zendesk will take in response to that event. This is where you provide the Zendesk access token.

   <img alt="Configure action dialog box" src="./_img/zendesk/configure-action.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />


> [!NOTE]    
	The Zendesk documentation states to append the User name with "/token". Do NOT include this on the User name as the integration already accounts for this.

Now when you comment on the work item, a private comment will be added to the Zendesk ticket.

## Pricing
VSTS doesn't charge for the framework for integrating with external services. Check out the specific service's site
for pricing related to their services. 

## Q & A

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="m-qanda" -->

#### Q:  Why do I keep getting prompted for a user name and password?

A: If you supplied a Personal Access Token (recommended) in the login panel of the app, make sure the token is scoped either to "all accessible accounts" or to the specific VSTS account configured in the app's settings. To open the app settings from Zendesk go to Settings > Apps > Manage.

Also make sure the token has not expired and that it has the **Work items (read and write)** scope.

For more details, see the Authenticating section above or the [Authenticate access with personal access tokens](../../accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md?toc=/vsts/accounts/toc.json&bc=/vsts/accounts/breadcrumb/toc.json) topic.

#### Q: Can I programmatically create subscriptions?

A: Yes, use the [REST APIs](../create-subscription.md).
