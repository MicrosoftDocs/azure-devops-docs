# Hubot with VSTS

Using Hubot, you can type a command in your VSTS team room
to create a work item, queue a build, recall what you last worked on, and more.
For example, create a bug by typing "hubot vso create bug Error in latest service code"
or assign a work item with the command "hubot vso assign 123 to Sally".
And you can add scripts to extend what your Hubot service can do.

## Set up Hubot

Set up a Hubot instance and configure the VSTS adapter
to accept messages from a team room in VSTS.

1. If you don't already have your own Hubot instance, set one up.
A good way to do that is to deploy Hubot to an Azure web site.

   1. Create an Azure web site enabled for local Git deployment.

   2. Create your own Hubot instance locally by cloning [Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot).

2. Add the [VSTS adapter for Hubot](https://github.com/scrumdod/hubot-VSOnline).

3. Add the [VSTS scripts for Hubot](https://github.com/scrumdod/vso-hubotscripts).

4. Push your configured Hubot instance to your web site.

5. Set the necessary configuration parameters on your site,
including HUBOT_ADAPTER=vsonline, and start it.

6. Create a service hook subscription in your VSTS project
that sends messages from a team room to your Hubot instance.

Here are more [detailed instructions](https://github.com/scrumdod/hubot-VSOnline)
for deploying a Hubot instance to an Azure web site.

## Subscribe Hubot to team room messages in VSTS

Now that you've set up Hubot, create a service hook subscription
that will forward messages in a VSTS team room
to your Hubot instance.

0. Go to your VSTS project service hooks page: `https://{account_name}.visualstudio.com/{project_name}/_apps/hub/ms.vss-servicehooks-web.manageServiceHooks-project`

	![Team project administration page](./_img/add-service-hook.png)

	Click **Create Subscription**.

3. Select the Hubot service.

4. Configure an event to trigger when there are messages posted in your team room.

   <img alt="" src="./_img/hubot/select-event.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

5. Select the **Post a message** action from the drop-down and supply the full URL and user name and password of your Hubot instance.

   <img alt="" src="./_img/hubot/hubot-http-action.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

6. Click **Finish** to save the subscription.

Now when you post commands starting with "hubot" to the selected room, Hubot will receive the command and respond back to that room.
