# AppVeyor with Azure DevOps Services

Set up continuous integration builds in AppVeyor for the code in your Azure DevOps Services Git repositories.

## Integrate AppVeyor with Azure DevOps Services

1. If you don't have an AppVeyor account, [sign up](http://ci.appveyor.com/signup) with your organization.

   <img alt="Azure DevOps Services button on the AppVeyor sign up page" src="./_img/appveyor/sign-up.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

2. Create a new project.

3. Add a Git repository from your organization.

   Now an AppVeyor CI build will start whenever you push code to your repository in Azure DevOps Services.

## Q & A

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="m-qanda" -->

####Q: Do I need to sign into AppVeyor using my Visual Studio ID in order to set up this integration?

A: No. If you use an organization that's not already associated with your Visual Studio ID,
you'll authorize access to your organization when you add Git repositories from Azure DevOps Services. 

####Q: Does AppVeyor change anything in my organization?

A: Yes. It adds a service hook subscription to your project.

####Q: What happens if I remove the AppVeyor project?

A: The AppVeyor service hook subscription is removed from Azure DevOps Services.

####Q: Can I get notification of AppVeyor builds in my Azure DevOps Services team room?

A: Yes, you can set that up in the AppVeyor Notifications page.

####Q: If I reconfigure AppVeyor from Azure DevOps Services, where do I get the webhook ID used by AppVeyor?

A: From the projects settings:
