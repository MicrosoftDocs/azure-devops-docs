# Troubleshoot Managed DevOps Pools issues

This article provides solutions to common Managed DevOps Pools issues.

## Pool creation errors

| Error code | Description |
|-------|------------------|
| `PoolProvisioningFailed` | [Pool creation failure due to Azure DevOps organization permissions](#pool-creation-failure-due-to-azure-devops-organization-permissions) |
| `UnauthorizedAccessToVirtualNetwork` | [Pool creation failure due to VNet permissions](#pool-creation-failure-due-to-vnet-permissions) |

### Pool creation failure due to Azure DevOps organization permissions

Pool creation fails with an error similar to one the following error messages.

#### The logged in user was not found in the Azure DevOps organization

* `Validation failure "PoolProvisioningFailed": "Failed to provision agent pool. Exception: The logged in user, <your user>, was not found in the Azure DevOps organization provided, <your Azure DevOps organization>."`

To resolve the issue:
* Your Azure DevOps organization must be connected to Microsoft Entra ID and your logged in Azure user must be a member (and not a guest) of this tenant. See [Managed DevOps Pools prerequisites - Connect your Azure DevOps organization to Microsoft Entra ID and verify membership](./prerequisites.md#connect-your-azure-devops-organization-to-microsoft-entra-id-and-verify-membership).

#### The logged in user does not have Manage permissions in the Azure DevOps organization

* `Validation failure "PoolProvisioningFailed": "Failed to provision agent pool. Exception: The logged in user, <your user>, does not have Manage permissions in the Azure DevOps organization provided, <your Azure DevOps organization>."`

To resolve the issue:
* Your logged in Azure user must have the proper Azure DevOps permissions to create a pool. See [Azure DevOps prerequisites - Verify Azure DevOps permissions](./prerequisites.md#verify-azure-devops-permissions).

### Pool creation failure due to VNet permissions

Pool creation fails with a `UnauthorizedAccessToVirtualNetwork` error similar to the following error: `Validation failure "UnauthorizedAccessToVirtualNetwork": "DevOpsInfrastructure service principal does not have Read access to virtual network <your VNet> in resource group <your resource group>. Give Reader and Network Contributor access to DevOpsInfrastructure service principal and try again.`.

To resolve this issue:
* Managed DevOps Pools requires access to your virtual network. See [Grant Reader and Network Contributor access to DevOpsInfrastructure service principal](./configure-networking.md#grant-reader-and-network-contributor-access-to-devopsinfrastructure-service-principal).
* The virtual network subnet needs to be delegated to `Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools`. See [Delegate the subnet to Microsoft.DevOpsInfrastructure/pools](./configure-networking.md#delegate-the-subnet-to-microsoftdevopsinfrastructurepools).

## Delays in pipeline startup

When using Managed DevOps Pools, you might encounter situations where there is a long delay before a pipeline starts to run after it is triggered. This section of the troubleshooting guide describes common items that can impact the performance of your pools. For more information, see [Manage cost and performance](./manage-costs.md).

* [Check time-out error codes](#check-time-out-error-codes)

### Check for insufficient parallel jobs

Managed DevOps Pools agents are considered to be self-hosted agents by Azure DevOps, and require self-hosted parallel jobs to run. For example, if your organization's self-hosted parallel count is 10, your organization can run only 10 self-hosted pipeline jobs concurrently. If more than 10 pipelines are queued, only 10 at a time can run.

Check your self-hosted parallel jobs count to ensure that you have enough capacity to meet the concurrent pipeline needs of your workload. For more information, see [Configure and pay for parallel jobs](../pipelines/licensing/concurrent-jobs.md).

### Check Maximum agents configuration

The [Maximum agents](./configure-pool-settings.md#maximum-agents) setting configures the maximum count of running agents in your Managed DevOps Pool. If the **Maximum agents** setting is 5, Managed DevOps Pools can run a maximum of five concurrent pipelines. If more than five pipelines are queued, the additional pipelines won't start until one of the five available agents is available.

> [!NOTE]
> **Maximum agents** configures the maximum number of agents that can be provisioned at the same time, but your organization's self-hosted parallel jobs count specifies the number of jobs that can run concurrently. Ensure that you have enough self-hosted parallel jobs available in your organization to enable your agents to run jobs. For more information, see [Azure DevOps Services parallel job pricing](./pricing.md#azure-devops-services-parallel-job-pricing).

### Consider pre-provisioning agents using a standby agent schedule

If [Standby agent mode](./configure-scaling.md#standby-agent-mode) is disabled, Managed DevOps Pools agents are started on demand when a pipeline is queued, and while typically a fresh agent takes only a few moments to start, sometimes it can take up to 15 minutes.

When **Standby agent mode** is enabled, you can specify a schedule and a count of agents to keep ready to meet the demands of your workload.

For more information, see [Manage cost and performance - Pre-provisioning with standby agents](./manage-costs.md#pre-provisioning-with-standby-agents).

#### Automatic standby mode for new pools

Manage DevOps Pools uses historical pool usage data to help make its [automatic standby mode](./configure-scaling.md#automatic) scaling predictions. New pools don't have any historical data, so agents might be created on demand. To improve performance, you can switch to manual standby mode for the first month, and switch to automatic standby mode once Managed DevOps Pools has had time to observe your pool's usage.

#### Check standby agent percentage if using standby agents with multiple images

If you use standby agents with multiple images, check the history of usage per image and compare it with the [Standby agent percentage](./configure-scaling.md#manual) setting of your images to ensure your standby ratio matches your usage. For example, if you have one Windows image and one Ubuntu image, and your workload uses Windows 75% of the time, ensure your Windows image is configured with a standby agent percentage of 75.

### Consider using Stateful pools with a grace period to keep agents online

One option to improve agent performance without using standby agents is to use stateful agents with a short grace period. When a stateful agent with a grace period completes a job, it stays online for the duration specified by the grace period and waits for additional jobs. If your workload comes in bursts, you can configure a grace period that keeps agents online when jobs are steady, and starts them from scratch during slower periods.

For more information, see [Standby agents](configure-scaling.md#standby-agent-mode) and [Stateful pools](configure-scaling.md#stateful-pools).

### Check time-out error codes

If your agent assignment times out, you can check the error code on the [Error codes](./monitor-pool.md#error-codes-chart) section of the [Overview](./monitor-pool.md#view-metrics-on-the-managed-devops-pool-overview) page.
