# Troubleshoot setting up Visual Studio with VSTS

**VSTS**

## Visual Studio

<a name="why-sign-in"></a>

### Q: Why sign in?

A:	Your Visual Studio settings, 
like automatic brace completion, 
are saved with your profile. 
These settings roam with your [personal Microsoft account](https://www.microsoft.com/account), 
or your [work or school account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sign-up-organization/), 
when you sign in to Visual Studio on any computer. 

Sign in to Visual Studio during the 30-day 
trial period for these benefits:

*	Visual Studio Enterprise: Extend your trial for 90 days. When your trial expires, 
learn [how to unlock Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn950037.aspx).
*	Visual Studio Express or Community: Continue to use this edition for free.

When you create your profile, 
you can also create a VSTS account.

that's managed by Azure Active Directory.

A:	Yes, for a better experience, 
you can change your account's location during sign up
so that your account is closest to most users.

Your account's default location is selected based on the closest

where VSTS is available.
