# Change application access policies for your account

**VSTS**

VSTS offers the capability for other apps to integrate with its services and resources in your VSTS account. To access your account without asking for user credentials multiple times, apps can use the following authentication methods:

* [OAuth](../integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth.md) to generate tokens for accessing [REST APIs for VSTS and Team Foundation Server](../integrate/get-started/rest/basics.md). The [Accounts](../integrate/api/shared/accounts.md) and [Profiles](../integrate/api/shared/profiles.md) APIs support only OAuth.

* [Alternate credentials](../git/auth-overview.md#alternate-credentials) as a single set of credentials across all tools that don't have plug-in, extension, or native support. For example, you can use basic authentication to access [REST APIs for VSTS and TFS](../integrate/get-started/rest/basics.md), but you must turn on alternate credentials.

* [SSH authentication](../git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate.md) to generate encryption keys when you use Linux, macOS, or Windows running [Git for Windows](http://www.git-scm.com/download/win) and can't use [Git credential managers](../git/set-up-credential-managers.md) or [personal access tokens](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) for HTTPS authentication.

* [Personal access tokens](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) to generate tokens for:

   * Accessing specific resources or activities, like builds or work items
   * Clients like Xcode and Nuget that require usernames and passwords as basic credentials and don't support Microsoft account and Azure Active Directory features like multi-factor authentication
   * Accessing [REST APIs for VSTS and TFS](../integrate/get-started/rest/basics.md)

By default, your VSTS account allows access for all authentication methods.
You can limit access, but you must specifically restrict access for each method.
When you deny access to an authentication method, no app can use that method to access your account. Any app that previously had access will get an authentication error and can't access your account.

> To remove access for personal access tokens,
> you must [revoke them](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md).

To continue, you'll need at least Basic access and VSTS account owner permissions.
[How do I find the account owner?](faq-change-app-access.md#find-owner)

1. Sign in as the account owner to your VSTS account (```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com```).

   [Why am I asked to choose between my work or school account and my personal account?](faq-change-app-access.md#ChooseOrgAcctMSAcct)

2. From your account toolbar, go to **Settings**.

    ![Choose the gear icon, go to Settings](../_shared/_img/account-settings-new-ui.png)

3. In the Policy tab, review your application connection settings. Change these settings, based on your security policies.
