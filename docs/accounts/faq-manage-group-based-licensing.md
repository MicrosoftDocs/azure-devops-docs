# Troubleshoot managing group-based licensing

**VSTS**

### Q: Will my users lose their access level and project membership if I remove a group rule?

A: Users in the group "TestGroup" will lose access to group resources if they have not been explicitly assigned to them or via a different group rule.

### Q: Will my VSTS or Azure AD group be deleted if I remove its group rule?

A: No, your groups will not be deleted.

### Q: What does the option to “Remove <group> from all project level groups” do?

A: It will remove the VSTS or Azure AD group from any project-level default groups, such as Project Readers or Project Contributors.
