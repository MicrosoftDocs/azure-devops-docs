# Change account owner for VSTS

**VSTS**

When your team's roles and responsibilities change, change your VSTS account owner to another user.

<a name="ChangeOwner"></a>

## Prerequisites

You must have VSTS [project collection administrator or account owner permissions](faq-change-account-ownership.md#find-owner-pca).
If no one has these permissions, contact
[VSTS Support](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/support).

Make sure that the new owner:

* Has been added and invited to your VSTS account (```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com```).
* Has signed in to your VSTS account, created a Visual Studio profile, and agreed to the Terms of Service.
* Has accessed the account, following initial profile creation, at least once.
