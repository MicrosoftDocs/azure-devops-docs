# Add team project members in VSTS

**VSTS**

Add members to your team project in VSTS, 
so you can share code and work with your team, track their status,
coordinate dev, build, test, and release activities, and more.
For Team Foundation Server, learn [how to add team project members here](../security/add-users-team-project.md).

When you add members to team projects,
VSTS automatically assigns
[Basic access](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/),
if your account has seats available, 
or [Stakeholder access](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/),
if not. When a [Visual Studio subscriber](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/subscriber-benefits-vs)
signs in, they'll get Basic access, and in some cases, additional features with specific extensions,
like [Test Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web).

> [!NOTE]
> To manually assign access levels,
> [add members to your account instead](add-account-users-assign-access-levels.md).
> To control access to account resources, see [Change individual permissions, grant select access to specific functions](../security/change-individual-permissions.md) or [Grant or restrict access to select features and functions](../security/restrict-access.md).

## Prerequisites

If you don't have a team project yet,
[create your team project first](../user-guide/connect-team-projects.md).
To add members to team projects, you'll need
[project administrator](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md),
[project collection administrator, or account owner](faq-add-team-members.md#find-pca-owner) permissions.

## Add members to your team project

1. Sign in to your VSTS account (```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com```) as project administrator, project collection administrator, or account owner.

   [Why am I asked to choose between my "work or school account" and my "personal account"?](faq-add-team-members.md#ChooseOrgAcctMSAcct)

2. On the account landing page (which is your projects page, ```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com/_projects```), find and select your team project.

   ![On your Projects page, select your team project](_img/add-team-members/select-team-project-updated-ui.png)

3. Invite members to your new team project...

    ![On your team project home page, choose Invite a friend](_img/add-team-members/invite-team.png)

   Or invite them to an existing team project.

   ![On your team project page, choose Manage team members](_img/add-team-members/invite-team-existing.png)

    Adding members from the project page adds them to the default team for the project.

    a. To add a member to a different team, choose the gear cog and **Security** from the menu.

    b. Find the team on the left pane of the security page and select it.

    c. In the right pane, choose the **Members** view (next to **Permissions**), and then you will see a green plus symbol and the **Add...** button.

4. Add your team members.

   ![Choose Add](_img/add-team-members/add-user.png)

5. Enter the email addresses for your new users, separated by semi-colons. Otherwise, enter the display names for existing users. Add them one at a time or all at once.

	Which email addresses can I add?
	 * If your VSTS account is Azure Active Directory backed, then you can only add email addresses that are
	 internal to the tenant.
	
	 * You must add email addresses for users who have ["personal" Microsoft accounts](https://www.microsoft.com/account) 
	unless your VSTS account [uses your organization's directory](faq-add-team-members.md#ConnectedDirectory) 
	to authenticate users and control account access through 
	[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/). 
	If new users don't have Microsoft accounts, have them [sign up](https://signup.live.com/).

    * If your VSTS account is connected to your organization’s directory, all users must be directory members and sign in to VSTS with work or school accounts that are managed by your organization’s directory. If they are not members, they will need to be [added to the directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/accounts/add-external-user?view=vsts).

	![Add members' sign-in addresses or display names](_img/add-team-members/add-user2.png)

	![Members are now added to your team project](_img/add-team-members/team-project-members.png) 	

	After you add members to your team project, 
	each member gets an invitation email that 
	links to your VSTS account. 
	They can use this link to sign in to your account 
	and find your team project.
	First-time members might be asked for extra details 
	when they sign in to personalize their experience.

    What if new team members don't receive or lose the invitation email?

    **Azure AD-backed accounts**: If you're [inviting a user from outside your Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b), the user must use the email. Removing a user from the VSTS account will remove both the access and license from the user. However, any artifacts that were assigned to this user remain unchanged. You can always invite the user back into the account if the user exists in the Azure AD tenant. Once the user is removed from Azure AD, you will not be able to assign any artifacts (work items, pull requests etc..) to this user. We will preserve the history of artifacts that as already been assigned to this user.

    **MSA-backed accounts**: You can send a link to the project page to the new team members, which is what the email contains. Removing a user from the VSTS account will remove both the access and license from the user. You will not be able to assign any artifacts (work items, pull requests, etc.) to this user anymore. However, any artifacts that were assigned to this user remain unchanged.
