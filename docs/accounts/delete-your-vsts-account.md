# Delete your VSTS account

**VSTS**

If you don't need your  VSTS account, you can delete it. 
If you change your mind within 30 days, 
you can [recover your account](recover-your-vsts-account.md). 
After 30 days, your account 
and data are permanently deleted.

When you delete your VSTS account:

*   All users lose access to account services and resources immediately.

*   Your account URL becomes available for anyone to use. 
But it might take up to 1 hour before your account URL becomes available again. 

*   Your account is disabled and appears deleted in your profile for 30 days.

*   If your account is linked to an Azure subscription for billing purchases, 
you must unlink your account before you delete your account. 

	You're still charged for any paid users and
	VSTS that your account uses during this billing cycle. 
	Billing will stop after the current cycle ends.

To delete your VSTS account, 
you'll need VSTS account owner permissions.
