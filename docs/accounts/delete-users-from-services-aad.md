#	Delete users from VSTS connected to Azure AD

**VSTS**

For more information, see the [conceptual overview](access-with-azure-ad.md) for using Azure AD with VSTS.

You can simply [delete the user from each VSTS account](delete-account-users.md) 
where you need to remove them. If you delete the user only from Azure AD, they may still show up in VSTS, but 
they won't be able to sign in.

0.  [Sign in to the Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) 
as the directory administrator in Azure.

	> [!NOTE]
	> You can find the connected Azure AD 
	> only through the Azure classic portal.

0.  Go to **VSTS**. 
Find the Azure AD that's connected to your 
VSTS account.
