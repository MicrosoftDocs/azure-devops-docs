#   Troubleshoot changing app access policies for your account

**VSTS**

<a name="Oauth"></a>

####Q:   How do personal access tokens differ from alternate authentication credentials?

A:  Personal access tokens are a more convenient and 
secure replacement for alternate authentication credentials. 
You can limit a token's use to a specific lifetime, 
a VSTS account, 
and to [scopes](https://www.visualstudio.com/integrate/get-started/Authentication/oauth#scopes) 
of activities that the token authorizes. Learn more about 
[personal access tokens here](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md).

####Q:  If I deny access to one authentication method in one VSTS account, does that affect all the accounts I own?

A:  No, you can still use that method in all the other VSTS accounts that you own. 
[Personal access tokens](use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) apply to specific accounts 
or to all accounts, based on your selection when you created the token.

####Q:  If I deny access to an authentication method, then allow access again, will the apps that need access continue to work?

A:  Yes, those apps will continue working.

####Q:  What apps integrate with VSTS?

A:  Find the [apps that integrate with VSTS here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSTS).
