# Add users to your VSTS account or team project

**VSTS**

Add users to your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) account and specify the level of features they can use, such as Basic or Stakeholder.
These kinds of users can join your VSTS account for free:

* 5 users who get [Basic features](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/),
such as version control, tools for Agile, Java, build, release management, and more
* Unlimited users who get [Stakeholder features](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/),
such as working with your backlog, work items, and queries
* Unlimited [Visual Studio subscribers](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/)
who also get Basic features, and in some cases, additional features with specific extensions, such as
[Test Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web)

[Need more users with Basic features or Visual Studio subscriptions?](add-basic-or-vs-subscription-users.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can add people to team projects,
> rather than to your account. VSTS automatically assigns them
> [Basic features](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/),
> if your account has seats available,
> or [Stakeholder features](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/compare-features/),
> if not. Learn [how to add members to team projects](add-team-members-vs.md).
>
> When people don't need access to your VSTS account anymore, [delete them](delete-account-users-users-hub.md) from your account.

## How *access* differs from *permissions*

Access levels control which features are available to users, while permissions control their access to account resources. To learn more, see [Default permissions and access](../security/permissions-access.md).

## Prerequisites

You'll need [VSTS project collection administrator or account owner permissions](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md?toc=/vsts/accounts/toc.json&bc=/vsts/accounts/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Add users to your VSTS account

Administrators can now add users to an account, grant access to appropriate tooling extensions and service access level,
and add users to groups all in one view. You can add up to 50 users at once.  You can add more than 50 users by repeatedly
using this Users view.  When you add users, each receives a notification email with a
link to the account page.

 > [!NOTE]
 > If have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) backed VSTS account, and you need to add users who are external to your Azure AD, first [add external users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/accounts/add-external-user?view=vsts) to
 > your Azure AD.  Be sure on the **Tell us about this user page**, under **Type of user**, to choose **User with an
 > existing Microsoft account**.  After completing those steps, follow the steps below to add the external Azure AD
 > user to VSTS.

Provide others access to your account by adding their email address.

1. Choose ![gear icon](../_img/icons/gear-icon.png), the gear Settings icon, and choose the **Account Settings** option.

   ![Open Account Settings](../user-guide/_img/sign-up/open-account-settings.png)

2. Then, choose **Users** to open the Manage users page. Choose **Add new users** to open the dialog.

   ![Open Add new users dialog](../user-guide/_img/sign-up/add-new-users.png)

3. Fill out the form.

   ![Web portal, account admin context, Add new users dialog](../user-guide/_img/invite-users-add-user-dialog.png)

   * **Users**: Enter the Microsoft account (MSA) email address for the user account. You can add several email addresses by separating them with a semicolon (;). Note that in MSAs, the email addresses display in red.
    * **Access level**: Leave the Access level at **Basic** for those users who will contribute to the code base. To learn more, see [About access levels](../security/access-levels.md).
   * **Add to projects**: Select the project that you named in the previous procedure.
   * **VSTS Groups**: Leave this entry at Project Contributors, the default security group for people who will contribute to your project. To learn more, see [Default permissions and access assignments](../security/permissions-access.md).

4. Choose **Add** to complete your invitation.
