# Troubleshoot access with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

**VSTS**

## General

### Q: I made changes to Azure AD, but they didn't seem to take effect?

A: Changes made in Azure AD may take up to 24 hours to be visible in VSTS.

<a name="o365aad"></a>

### Q: Can I use Office 365 Azure AD with VSTS?

A: To connect your VSTS account to an Office 365 Azure AD,
you can't use the [free subscription](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832618.aspx)
that you can activate for your Office 365 Azure AD.

You must [sign up for a new Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/)
or use an existing Azure subscription
that's **not** from one of these offers:

* An [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/)

* A [free Azure AD subscription](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832618.aspx)

You must then associate that subscription with your Office 365 Azure AD. You'll also need additional subscription
administrator permissions beyond co-administrator permissions.

Learn how to [associate your Azure subscription to your Office 365 Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing-add-office-365-tenant-to-azure-subscription).

<a name="ChangeMSA"></a>

### Q: My account uses Microsoft accounts only. Can I switch to Azure AD?

A: Yes, but before you switch, make sure that Azure AD meets your needs
for sharing work items, code, resources,
and other assets with your team and partners.

Learn more about the differences in how you
[control access with Microsoft accounts or with Azure AD, and how to switch](access-with-azure-ad.md)
when you're ready.

## Understand Azure AD groups

### Q: Why can't I assign VSTS permissions directly to an Azure AD group?

A: Because these groups are created and managed in Azure,
you can't assign VSTS permissions directly
or secure version control paths to these groups.
You'll get an error if you try to assign permissions directly.

But, you can add an Azure AD group to the VSTS
group that has the permissions you want. Or,
you can assign these permissions to the VSTS group instead.
Azure AD group members will inherit permissions from
the VSTS group where you add them.

### Q: Can I manage Azure AD groups in VSTS?

A: No, because these groups are created and managed in Azure. 
VSTS doesn't store or sync member status for Azure AD groups. 
So, to manage Azure AD groups, use the 
[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM), 
or the group management tools that your organization supports.

### Q: How do I tell the difference between a VSTS group and an Azure AD group?

A: On the group's identity card, check the group's source:

![To find the group's source, check the group's identity card](_img/manage-azure-ad-groups/checkidentitysourceaad.png)

### Q: Why doesn't the Users hub show all Azure AD group members?

A: These users have to sign in to your VSTS 
account before they appear in the Users hub. 

<a name="AssignLicenses"></a>

### Q: How do I assign account access to Azure AD group members?

A: When these group members sign in to your VSTS account for the first time,
VSTS assigns an access level to them automatically. If they have
[Visual Studio subscriptions](faq-add-delete-users.md#EligibleMSDNSubscriptions),
VSTS assigns the respective access level to them.
Otherwise, VSTS assigns them the next "best available"
[access level](https://www.visualstudio.com/pricing/visual-studio-online-feature-matrix-vs)
in this order: Basic, Stakeholder
 
If you don't have enough access levels for all Azure AD group members,
those members who sign in will get a Stakeholder access.

### Q: Why doesn't the Security tab show all members when I select an Azure AD group?

A: The Security tab shows Azure AD group members
only after they sign in to your VSTS account
and have an access level assigned to them.

To see all Azure AD group members, use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM),
or the group management tools that your organization supports.

### Q: Why doesn't the team members widget show all Azure AD group members?

A: The team members widget shows only users who previously
signed in to your VSTS account.

### Q: Why doesn't the team capacity pane show all Azure AD group members?

A: The team capacity pane shows only users who previously
signed in to your VSTS account.
To set capacity, manually add users to your team.

### Q: Why doesn't the team room show offline users?

A: The team room shows Azure AD group members,
but only when they're online.

### Q: Why doesn't VSTS reclaim access levels from users who aren't Azure AD group members anymore?

A: VSTS doesn't automatically 
reclaim access levels from these users. 
To manually remove their access, go to the Users hub.

### Q: Can I assign work items to Azure AD group members who haven't signed in?

A: You can assign work items to any Azure AD member who has permissions
for your VSTS account.
This also adds that member to your VSTS account.
When you add users this way, they'll automatically appear
in the Users hub with the best available
access level and in the security settings, too.

### Q: Can I use Azure AD groups to query work items using the "In Group" clause?

A: No, querying on Azure AD groups is unsupported.

### Q: Can I use Azure AD groups to set up field rules in my work item templates?

A: No, but read more here about our
[process customization plans](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/07/27/visual-studio-online-process-customization-update.aspx).

<a name="remove-user-azure-ad-group"></a>

### Q: Why am I asked to remove a user from an Azure AD group when I delete that user from my VSTS account?

A: Users can belong to your VSTS account,
both as individuals and as members of Azure AD groups
that were added to VSTS groups in your VSTS account.
These users can still access your VSTS account while they're members of these Azure AD groups.

To block all access for these users,
please remove them from Azure AD groups in your VSTS account,
or remove these groups from your VSTS account.
Although we'd like to make it possible to block
access completely or make exceptions for such users,
VSTS doesn't currently have this capability.

### Q: How do I remove an Azure AD group from VSTS?

A: Go to your team project collection or team project.  Then, go to the control panel by choosing the gear icon in the
top navigation bar and **Security** in the menu.

Find the Azure AD group, then delete that group from your VSTS account.

## Add users to directory

### Q: Can I switch current users from Microsoft accounts to work accounts in VSTS?

A:  No, although you can add new work accounts to your VSTS account,
they're treated as new users. If you want to access all your work,
including its history, you must use the same sign-in addresses that
you used before your VSTS account was connected to your Azure AD.
You can do this by adding your Microsoft account as a member to your Azure AD.

### Q: Why can't I add users from other directories to my Azure AD?

A: You must be a member or have read access in those directories.
Otherwise, you can add them
[using B2B collaboration through your Azure AD administrator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-b2b-collaboration-overview/), 
using their Microsoft accounts, 
or create new work accounts for them in your directory.

### Q: How do I use my work or school account with my Visual Studio with MSDN subscription?

A:  If you used a Microsoft account to activate a
[Visual Studio with MSDN subscription](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/)
that includes VSTS as a benefit, 
you can add a work or school account that's
managed by Azure Active Directory to your subscription.
Learn [how to link work or school accounts to Visual Studio with MSDN subscriptions](../billing/link-msdn-subscription-to-organizational-account-vs.md).

<a name="guest-access"></a>

### Q: Can I control access to my VSTS account for external users in the connected directory?

A: Yes, but only for external users who are
[added as guests through Office 365](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-sites-or-documents-with-people-outside-your-organization-80E49744-E30F-44DB-8D51-16661B1D4232)
or [added using B2B collaboration by your Azure AD administrator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-b2b-collaboration-overview/).
These external users are managed outside the connected directory.
To learn more, contact your Azure AD administrator. The setting below doesn't affect
[users who are added directly to your organization's directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-create-users/).

> Before you start, make sure you have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder.

**To control account access for external users added through Office 365 or Azure AD B2B collaboration**

1. Go to your VSTS account's control panel.

   ![Go to account control panel](_img/_shared/accountsettings.png)

2. Go to your account settings.

   Allow or deny account access for external users added as guests.

## Connect to directory

<a name="connect-o365-azure-ad"></a>

### Q: Can I connect my VSTS account to an Azure AD created from Office 365?

A: Yes, but if you can't find your Office 365 Azure AD
when connecting your account in the Azure portal,
learn what you're missing in this FAQ:
[Why don't I see the directory that I want to connect?](#why-not-my-directory)

<a name="no-directory-subscription"></a>

### Q: Why don't I see a directory associated with my Azure subscription?

A: You need an active and valid
["full" Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/),
such as a ["Pay-As-You-Go" subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0003p/),
associated with your organization's Azure AD and at
least co-administrator permissions for your subscription.
You need both to make your directory appear in the Azure portal,
so that you can link your subscription
and connect your Azure AD to your VSTS account. Learn
[how to manage Azure subscription administrators](../billing/add-backup-billing-managers.md).

<a name="why-not-my-directory"></a>

### Q: Why don't I see the directory that I want to connect? What should I do?

A: This might happen because:

* You don't have [VSTS account owner permissions](faq-change-app-access.md#find-owner) to manage directory connections.

* You don't have an active and valid ["full" Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/), such as a ["Pay-As-You-Go" subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0003p/), associated with your organization's Azure AD and at least co-administrator permissions for your subscription. You need both to make your directory appear in the Azure portal, so that you can link your subscription and connect your Azure AD to your VSTS account. Learn [how to manage Azure subscription administrators](../billing/add-backup-billing-managers.md).

  For example, if you want to use an Office 365 Azure AD,
  you can't use the [free subscription](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832618.aspx)
  that you can get for Office 365 Azure AD.
  You must [sign up for a new Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/)
  or use an existing Azure subscription
  that's **not** from one of these offers:

  * An [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0044p/)
  * A [free Azure AD subscription](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn832618.aspx)

  You must then associate that subscription with your Office 365 Azure AD.
  To do this for your Office 365 Azure AD,
  you'll also need additional subscription administrator permissions
  beyond co-administrator permissions. Learn how to
  [associate your Azure subscription to your Office 365 Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing-add-office-365-tenant-to-azure-subscription),
  or learn more about the
  [relationship between your Azure subscription and your Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory#how-an-azure-subscription-is-related-to-azure-ad).

<a name="remove-spending-limit"></a>

* Your VSTS account isn't linked to the Azure subscription that's associated with your directory. Learn [how to link your VSTS account to an Azure subscription](../billing/set-up-billing-for-your-account-vs.md).

  **Important** This link also sets up account billing,
  so you can bill VSTS purchases to your Azure subscription.
  Some Azure subscriptions have a
  [spending limit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/spending-limits/).
  If your Azure subscription has a spending limit,
  and you want to bill purchases to this subscription,
  you must remove this limit **indefinitely**.
  This prevents disabling your Azure subscription the
  next month when your monthly charges are billed.
  Otherwise, all resources billed to this subscription will be suspended,
  including all VSTS purchases,
  Visual Studio Marketplace purchases,
  and Azure resources. Learn more about
  [how to manage your subscription's spending limit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn465781.aspx).

  If you're the subscription [Account Administrator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator),
  visit the Azure Account Center to remove the spending limit:

1. Sign in to [Azure Account Center (**Account** > **subscriptions**)](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select your Azure subscription. 
3. Remove your spending limit **indefinitely**.

<a name="subscription-linked-already"></a>

### Q: What if my VSTS account is already linked to an Azure subscription?

A:  You can [change the Azure subscription](../billing/change-azure-subscription.md) that's linked to your VSTS account.
However, unlinking will cause your account to revert to the free tier. See the [VSTS billing FAQ](../billing/vsts-billing-faq.md) for details.

### Q:  What happens if I unlink my Azure subscription while my VSTS account is connected to a directory?

A:  See the [VSTS billing FAQ](../billing/vsts-billing-faq.md) for details.

<a name="AlreadyConnected"></a>

### Q: Why is my VSTS account already connected to a directory? Can I change that directory?

A: Your VSTS account was connected to a directory when the
account owner created the account or sometime after that.
When you create a VSTS account with a work or school account,
your VSTS account is automatically connected to the directory
that manages that work or school account.
You can [disconnect your VSTS account](disconnect-account-from-aad.md) from this directory
and reconnect to another directory, but you might have to migrate some users.

<a name="AlternateCredentials"></a>

### Q: My alternate credentials don't work anymore. What do I do?

A:  This happens after you connect your VSTS
account to a directory. You must
[set up your credentials](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2991274)
again for the account that you connected.

<a name="CantSignIn"></a>

### Q: Why can't users sign in after my VSTS account is connected to a directory?

A:  Make sure their sign-in addresses are in the
connected directory and in your VSTS account.
If they're not directory members, and you have at least
[user administrator permissions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-assign-admin-roles/),
you can [add them to the directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-create-users/).

Some users have sign-in addresses that are shared by their
Microsoft account and their work or school account.
These are treated as separate identities with different profiles,
security settings, and permissions. When they're asked to choose
which account they want to use when they sign in, they should
choose the identity that's a member in your directory because
only directory members can get access to your account.

If you have a Visual Studio with MSDN subscription that 
[includes VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing/) as a benefit,
and you activated that subscription with a Microsoft account,
you can add a work or school account that's managed by Azure Active Directory to your subscription.
Learn [how to link work or school accounts to Visual Studio with MSDN subscriptions](../billing/link-msdn-subscription-to-organizational-account-vs.md).

<a name="faq-disconnect"></a>

## Disconnect from directory

### Q: Why can't users sign in after my VSTS account is disconnected?

A:  They must now use Microsoft accounts to sign in.
They can continue working seamlessly if they have Microsoft
accounts with the same sign-in addresses that they use now.

If they must create Microsoft accounts with different sign-in addresses,
you must add those sign-in-addresses to your VSTS account,
and reassign access to them. They can migrate work that they want to keep,
except work history. They might also have to re-link their MSDN
subscriptions. They can use any email address to create a Microsoft account.
