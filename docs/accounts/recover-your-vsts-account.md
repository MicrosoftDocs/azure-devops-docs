# Restore your VSTS account

**VSTS**

Your account will be disabled but available for 30 days after you delete it.
If you change your mind during this time, you can recover your account.
After 30 days, your account and data are permanently deleted.

## Prerequisites

* You need to have an account that has been deleted within the last 30 days.
* You'll need VSTS account owner permissions to restore your VSTS account. [How do I find the account owner?](faq-delete-restore-vsts-account.md#find-owner)

1.	Sign in to your [Visual Studio profile](https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/profile/view).

	[Why am I asked to choose between my work or school account and my personal account?](faq-delete-restore-vsts-account.md#ChooseOrgAcctMSAcct)

2.  Go to the "Accounts Pending Deletion" section at the bottom of your profile page. There you will see a link to restore your account.

3. Choose **Restore**.

	*	If your account URL is still available, you can restore it.

    ![Confirm restoring your account](_img/delete-account/restore-confirm.png)

	*	If your account URL isn't available, provide a new URL.

      ![Rename your deleted account](_img/delete-account/rename-deleted-account.png)

4.  After you restore your account:

    *	If billing was set up for your account, you'll have to set it up again. Just [relink your account](../billing/set-up-billing-for-your-account-vs.md) to an Azure subscription.

    *   If your account was connected to Azure AD for authenticating user access, you won't have to reconnect it again.
