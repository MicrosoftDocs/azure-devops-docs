#  Add VSTS account users to your Azure Active Directory

**VSTS**

If your VSTS account was created with a Microsoft account, 
you can connect your VSTS account to your 
organization's directory (tenant) in 
[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/). 
You can then sign in to VSTS with the same username 
and password that you use with these Microsoft services. 
You can also enforce policies for accessing 
your team's critical resources and key assets.

For more information, see the [conceptual overview](access-with-azure-ad.md) for using Azure AD with VSTS.

If your users do not already exist in Azure AD:

0.  Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) 
or the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) 
as global administrator for your organization's directory. 
See these topics for how to:

	*	[Add users in the Azure classic portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-create-users).
	*	[Add users in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-users-create-azure-portal).

0.	Add the sign-in addresses for all your VSTS account users to your directory, 
including yourself as the VSTS account owner, if not in the directory already. 

  What does an example directory look like?
  
  Suppose Jamal is an Azure AD global administrator at Fabrikam and is in the Fabrikam directory with his 
  work account (jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com). He's also the VSTS account owner and a user with his Microsoft 
  account (jamalhartnett@live.com). He wants to keep his work history, so he adds his Microsoft account to the 
  Fabrikam directory. If Jamal doesn't need his work history, he can use his work account with VSTS. To free up the access used by his Microsoft account, he must change the VSTS account owner to his work account. 

  Nicole, another user, has a work account (nicolezamora@fabrikam.com) that shares the same sign-in address as her 
  Microsoft account, so she will continue to work seamlessly with the same sign-in address.

  Here's what the Fabrikam directory might look like in the Azure classic portal after Jamal adds users from his 
  VSTS account.

connect your VSTS account to your directory.
