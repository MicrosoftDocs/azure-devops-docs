# Navigating in the web portal 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

The web portal provides support for teams to collaborate through the planning, development, and release cycles. You use the web portal to perform both software development and administrative tasks.  

You can manage source code, plan and track work, define builds, run tests, and manage releases. The web portal connects you to the team project defined for an account in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or within an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS). 

If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [VSTS](../accounts/create-account-msa-or-work-student.md?toc=/vsts/accounts/toc.json&bc=/vsts/accounts/breadcrumb/toc.json) or set one up in an [on-premises TFS](../accounts/create-team-project.md). If you don't have access to the team project, [get invited to the team](../work/scale/multiple-teams.md#add-team-members).

>[!NOTE]  
>The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this topic. These differences result from updates made to VSTS or your on-premises TFS and [options that you or your admin have enabled](../collaborate/preview-features.md?toc=/vsts/user-guide/toc.json&bc=/vsts/user-guide/breadcrumb/toc.json). However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned.  

<img src="_img/web-portal-intro.png" alt="Code, Pull Request, Active example" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />


>[!NOTE]  
>**Feature availability**: The features available to you depend on the platform (VSTS or on-premises TFS), TFS version, features enabled for your team project or collection, and your access level. New features are deployed regularly to VSTS. Many of these features are then made available to [on-premises TFS through regular updates](/vsts/release-notes/index).  

To get started, from a [supported web browser](/tfs/server/compatibility#browsers) enter the following URL:

::: moniker range="vsts"
<pre><code>https://<i>AccountName</i>.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/<i>ProjectName</i></code></pre>
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013"
<pre><code>http://<i>ServerName</i>:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/<i>ProjectName</i></code></pre>


>[!NOTE]  
>Your TFS administrator can configure the following elements: protocol (*https* vs *http*), port (*8080*), virtual directory (*tfs*), and collection name (*DefaultCollection*) (See [Web site settings and security](../security/websitesettings.md).) For example, a deployment configured on port 443 with no vdir, an FQDN, and a custom collection name might look like: *https://tfs.contoso.com/CustomCollection/ProjectName*. If the above pattern doesn't work for you, check with your TFS administrator.    
 
::: moniker-end

The web portal is one of several clients that can connect to a team project. Different clients support different features and functions. For a list of all clients that support connection to a team project, see [Tools and clients that connect to VSTS and TFS](tools.md?toc=/vsts/user-guide/toc.json&bc=/vsts/user-guide/breadcrumb/toc.json). 

<a id="nav-concepts">  </a>

## Navigational concepts

There are three main navigational concepts to understand. The first is the collection-project-team structure, the second is the user/administrative context, and the third corresponds to user-focused and team-scoped features that provide quick access to tasks targeted for the logged-in user or for the selected team.

<a id="collection-project-team-structure">  </a>

### Collection-project-team structure

When you connect to VSTS or an on-premises TFS, you connect to an account or team project collection. Within that collection, one or more team projects may be defined. At a minimum, at least one team project must be created in order to use the system.

When you create your team project, a team of the same name is automatically created. For small teams, this is sufficient.  

However, for enterprise-level organizations, it may be necessary to scale up, to create additional teams and/or team projects. These can be created within the single account or collection.

<table width="100%">
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
<td width="40%">
**Single team project, team defined within an account/collection**  
![Single collection-project-team conceptual image](_img/web-portal-account-project-team-concept.png)  
</td>

<td width="60%">
**Multiple team projects and teams defined within an account/collection**   
![Scaled collection-project-team conceptual image](_img/web-portal-account-project-team-scale-concept.png)  

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The collection-project-team structure provides teams a high-level of autonomy to configure their tools in ways that work for them. It also supports administrative tasks to occur at the appropriate level.

To learn more about adding teams and the features that support team autonomy, see [Multiple teams](../work/scale/multiple-teams.md) and [Manage team assets](../work/scale/manage-team-assets.md).

<a id="user-admin-context">  </a>

### User/administrative context

The user context is used to get work done&mdash;manage code, plan and track work,  define and manage builds, create and run tests, and so on. Administrators use the admin context to configure shared resources and permissions. Tasks performed in this context can impact the team project and team functions.  

**User context**   
You and other team members use the user context to collaborate, plan, and build working software.

::: moniker-end

<a id="admin-context">  </a>

**Administrative context**  
You use the administrative context to set team, team project, and account or collection settings. The hubs and pages available change based on what level of administrative context you're in. 

To learn more about each administrative context level, see the [Administrative context and team, team project, and account/collection settings](#administrative-context) later in this topic.

<a id="user-focused-features">  </a>

## User-focused features

Several features display information based on the logged-in user account or the selected team context. First off, users can [set their preferences](../accounts/account-preferences.md?toc=/vsts/user-guide/toc.json&bc=/vsts/user-guide/breadcrumb/toc.json) through their profile or account menu:

<img src="../accounts/_img/account-prefs/open-profile-team-services.png" alt="VSTS, My Profile link on Account menu" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />   

In addition, they have access to special queries&mdash;Assigned to me query, Followed work items, and more&mdash; dashboard widget such as the Assigned to me widget, and the ability to save favorites under a **My favorites** folder. Here's an example of the Assigned to me widget that you can add to a dashboard. 

<img src="_img/web-portal-assigned-to-me-widget.png" alt="VSTS, web portal, user profile/account menu" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" /> 


>[!NOTE]  
>If you work in VSTS, you can also use your account hub to view and quickly navigate to teams, team projects, branches, work items, pull requests and other objects that are relevant to you. For details, see [Work effectively from your account hub](account-home-pages.md?toc=/vsts/user-guide/toc.json&bc=/vsts/user-guide/breadcrumb/toc.json).     


<a id="team-scoped-features">  </a>

## Team-scoped features

Teams access their set of team-scoped features by choosing their team context. Each team gets access to a suite of Agile tools and team assets. These tools provide teams the ability to work autonomously and collaborate with other teams across the enterprise.

![Agile tool team assets](../settings/_img/agile-tools/agile-tools-team-assets-post-2018.png)  

Also, teams can set their query and build favorites within **Team favorites** folders. For more information, see [Manage team assets](../work/scale/manage-team-assets.md).  


<a id="user-context">  </a>

## User context: hubs and tabs

You perform the bulk of your tasks by accessing a page within one of the these hubs&mdash;**Home**, **Code**, **Work**,  **Build** and **Test** &mdash;and their corresponding  tabs&mdash;such as **Overview**, **Backlogs**, **Queries**. For an overview of each hub, see [Essential services](services.md?toc=/vsts/user-guide/toc.json&bc=/vsts/user-guide/breadcrumb/toc.json).


The next sections list what you can do, based on the hub and page you select.

<!--- Put a note here about the access level you have, and the options configured for your deployment. -->

### Welcome page, dashboards, and plan and track work

The **Home** or **Dashboards** hub supports a configurable Welcome page and dashboards. From the **Work** hub, you gain access to a highly configurable suite of Agile tools to plan and track your work.

### Navigating within the admin context (VSTS and TFS 2017)  

From a team context, open team settings by clicking the ![](_img/work-tfs-web-portal/IC623347.png) gear Settings icon. Optionally, choose the hub you want to view from the menu options that appear. 

<img src="_img/web-portal-open-team-settings-new-nav.png" alt="Web portal, new nav, open team settings" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />   

The admin team settings hubs appear. Note that you can click any of the user-context hubs of **Home**, **Code**, **Work**, and so on to return to the user context.

#### Admin team project settings 
To open the admin context for the team project, open project settings by clicking the ![](_img/work-tfs-web-portal/IC623347.png) gear Settings icon from the team project context. Optionally, choose the hub you want to view from the menu options that appear. 

<img src="_img/web-portal-open-project-settings-new-nav.png" alt="Web portal, new nav, open project settings" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  

The admin project setting hubs appear. While the hub names are similar to those of the team admin context, the details differ in select cases, such as for the **Overview**, **Work**, and **Security** hubs. Also, just like from the team admin context, you can click any of the user-context hubs of **Home**, **Code**, **Work**, and so on to return to the user context.   

<img src="_img/web-portal-admin-project-settings-new-nav.png" alt="Web portal, new nav, project admin setting" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />    

#### Admin account settings

### User accounts and licensing  

::: moniker range="vsts"

To connect to the web portal, you need your user account added to the team project. This is typically done by the [account owner](../accounts/add-account-users-assign-access-levels.md?toc=/vsts/accounts/toc.json&bc=/vsts/accounts/breadcrumb/toc.json).

Five account users are free as are Visual Studio subscribers and stakeholders. After that, you need to [pay for more users](../billing/buy-basic-access-add-users.md). Find out more about licensing from [VSTS pricing](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/pricing/).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013"

To connect to the web portal, you need your user account added to the team project. This is typically done by the [project administrator](../security/add-users-team-project.md?toc=/tfs/server/toc.json&bc=/tfs/server/breadcrumb/toc.json).

Limited access is available to an unlimited number of stakeholders for free. For details, see [Work as a Stakeholder](../security/get-started-stakeholder.md?toc=/vsts/user-guide/toc.json&bc=/vsts/user-guide/breadcrumb/toc.json). Most regular contributors must have a TFS client access license (CAL). All Visual Studio subscriptions include a TFS CAL. Find out more about licensing from [TFS pricing](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/tfs-pricing).

### Refresh the web portal

If data doesn't appear as expected, the first thing to try is to refresh your web browser. Refreshing your client updates the local cache with changes that were made in another client or the server. To refresh the page or object you're currently viewing, refresh the page or choose the ![Refresh icon](../work/_img/icons/icon-refresh-wi.png) **Refresh** icon if available.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/when-to-refresh-client.md)]

<a id="clients">  </a>
### Clients that support connection to a team project

In addition to connecting through a web browser, you can connect to a team project from these clients:

- [Visual Studio (Professional, Enterprise, Test Professional)](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/compare-visual-studio-2015-products-vs)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs)
- [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)
- [Eclipse: Team Explorer Everywhere](/vsts/java/download-eclipse-plug-in)
- [Office Excel](../work/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md)
- [Office Project](../work/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md)
- [PowerPoint Storyboarding](../work/backlogs/office/storyboard-your-ideas-using-powerpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Test Manager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj635157.aspx)
- [Microsoft Feedback Client](../feedback/give-feedback.md)

### Differences between the web portal and Visual Studio  

Although you can access source code, work items, and builds from both clients, some task-specific tools are only supported in the web browser or an IDE, but not in both.

### Can I open a query in Excel or Project from the web portal?  

To open Excel from the web portal, install the [VSTS Open in Excel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blueprint.vsts-open-work-items-in-excel) Marketplace extension. Otherwise, you can open [Excel](../work/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](../work/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md) and then open a query that you've created in the web portal.
