## Tips for effective feedback

If you want to vent about the product or the documentation, that's okay. It helps us know when you're happy or unhappy with an experience. Provide the following details so we can better understand what we're doing right or wrong:

* **Provide context**. What problem were you trying to solve? At what point did it go wrong?
* **Include your role**. Are you a developer, manager, or business owner? Understanding our audience helps us create better solutions.
* **Include your product version**. What other products were you using with it?

### Give product feedback

Enter clear, precise, detailed feedback when you [create a support request](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/).

**Example:** "I'm a project manager for a small start-up using Azure DevOps. I'm trying to create work item templates through the UI, but my changes don't persist. It's not clear what I'm doing wrong."

### Give documentation feedback

All articles on Microsoft Learn have a ratings tool. Select **Feedback** beneath the title of the article, and in the "Was this page helpful?" pane, select **Yes** or **No** based on your experience.

Enter clear, precise, detailed feedback in the **Tell us more** section. Avoid including sensitive or personal information. Although we can't reply, we regularly review this feedback and use it in our content planning.

**Example:** "I'm a developer in a large organization working on Java apps. I tried to use Maven with your build system in Azure DevOps Server 2017 Update 1 (15.112.26307.0), but I couldn't get the configuration shown in the documentation to work."
