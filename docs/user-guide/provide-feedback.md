## Documentation feedback

All articles on Microsoft Learn have a ratings tool. Select **Feedback** beneath the title of the article, and in the resulting "Was this page helpful?" pane, select **Yes** or **No** depending on your experience.

Enter more detailed feedback in the **Tell us more** section. Make sure you don't include sensitive or personal information. Although we can't reply back, we collect and review this feedback regularly, and use your sentiments in our content planning.

## Tips for effective feedback

If you just want to vent about the product or the documentation, that's okay. It helps us a lot to know when you're happy or unhappy with an experience. Provide details so we can better understand what we're doing right or wrong.

* Provide a little context. What problem were you trying to solve? At what point did it go wrong?
* Include your role. We don't need personal or professional details. Are you a dev? A manager? A business owner? When we understand our audience, we can come up with better solutions for you and other customers doing similar work.
* Include the version of the product you're using. What other products were you using with it?

The best feedback we get is clear and precise. For example:

* Product feedback: "I'm a project manager for a small start-up. I'm using Azure DevOps. I'm trying to create work item templates through the UI, but my changes don't seem to persist. It's not clear what I'm doing wrong."
* Doc feedback: "I'm a dev in a large organization that works on Java apps. I tried to use Maven with your build system in Azure DevOps Server 2017 Update 1 (15.112.26307.0), but I couldn't get the configuration shown in the documentation to work."

The more details, the better!
