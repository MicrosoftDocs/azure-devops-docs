# Get VSTS and TFS product support and provide feedback

[!INCLUDE [temp](../work/_shared/dev15-version-header.md)] 

We're always working to improve VSTS, and we want you to be part of the process! Share your feedback and ideas with us, or join our communities.

Do you need to:

* **Get advice?** Visit StackOverflow for [VSTS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vsts) or [TFS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tfs).

* **Report a bug?** Submit it through our Developer Community for [VSTS](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/21/index.html) or [TFS](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/22/index.html).

* **Suggest a feature or a fix?** Submit your idea or issue through [UserVoice for VSTS](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/330519-team-services).

* **Find out what's new in VSTS?** Check out the [current VSTS Release Notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/release-notes/). These notes are updated every three weeks.

## Documentation feedback

All docs on docs.microsoft.com have a ratings tool in the lower right-hand corner of the page. It asks "Is this content helpful?" Answer **Yes** or **No** depending on your experience.

You can add more detailed feedback by clicking the "Tell us more" link after selecting **Yes** or **No**. Check an appropriate box and add what we can do to improve the content for you! Although we cannot reply back, we collect and review these regularly, and use your sentiments in our content planning.

## Tips for effective feedback

If you just want to vent about the product or the docs, that's okay. It helps us a lot to know when you're happy or unhappy with an experience. For the most impact, though, provide details so we can better understand what we're doing right or wrong.

* Provide a little context. What problem were you trying to solve? At what point did it go wrong?
* What's your role? We don't need personal or professional details. Are you a dev? A manager? A business owner? When we understand our audience, we can come up with better solutions for you and other customers doing similar work.
* What version of the product were you using? What other products were you using with it?

The best feedback we get is clear and precise. For example:

* Product feedback: "I'm a project manager for a small start-up. I am using VSTS. I am trying to create work item templates through the UI, but my changes don't seem to persist. It's not clear what I'm doing wrong."
* Doc feedback: "I'm a dev in a big organization that works on Java apps. I tried to use Maven with your build system in TFS 2017 Update 1 (15.112.26307.0), but I couldn't get the configuration shown in the docs to work."

The more details, the better!

## What platform/version am I using? 

You can tell what platform you use from the URL you use to connect to VSTS or TFS. 

**VSTS**

A VSTS URL consists of an account name and visual studio.com, for example: ```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com```.  

To learn the version number, enter the following address in a web browser:
```
https://AccountName.visualstudio.com/_home/About
```
A page similar to the one shown will open showing the version number.

**TFS**

A TFS URL consists of a server name and collection, for example: ```https://ServerName:8080/tfs/CollectionName```.

To learn the version number, enter the following address in a web browser:
```
https://ServerName:8080/tfs/_home/About
```
A page similar to the one shown will open showing the version number.
