# Visual Studio Team Services is now Azure DevOps Services

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

On September 10, 2018, Microsoft renamed Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to Azure DevOps Services. For more information about this change, see [this blog post](https://aka.ms/azurevsts).

VSTS features are now separate services:

| VSTS feature name    | Azure DevOps service name | Description |
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Build & release      | Azure Pipelines      | Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) that works with any language, platform, and cloud. |
| Code                 | Azure Repos          | Unlimited cloud-hosted private Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repos for your project. |
| Work                 | Azure Boards         | Work tracking with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting. |
| Test                 | Azure Test Plans     | All-in-one planned and exploratory testing solution. |
| Packages (extension) | Azure Artifacts      | Maven, npm, and NuGet package feeds from public and private sources. |


Currently, you can acquire only Azure Pipelines as a separate service. In the future, you'll be able to acquire each service separately or all together as Azure DevOps Services. If you are already a VSTS subscriber, you have access to all of the services now.  

> [!NOTE]   
> You can [disable select services from the user interface](../organizations/settings/set-services.md).

Follow the [Azure DevOps release notes](/vsts/release-notes/index) to get news on the latest updates.

## Can I still use visualstudio.com?

Yes. We've moved to the new `dev.azure.com` domain name as the primary URL for new organizations. (Specifically, it's `https://dev.azure.com/{your organization}/{your project}`.) If you want to change your URL to be based on `dev.azure.com` as the primary, an organization administrator can change this from the organization settings page.

We will continue to post news about this transition on the [Microsoft DevOps blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/) and in the [Azure DevOps release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/vsts/release-notes/index).

## Can I still use the old interface?

Yes. Although Azure DevOps Services features [redesigned navigation](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.msdn.microsoft.com%2Fdevops%2F2018%2F06%2F19%2Fnew-navigation%2F&data=02%7C01%7C%7Cdf018290c8a646863ded08d614f21833%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636719427348139788&sdata=5pJH93e4i2IYZqgBp48uHTKZDkG5iQnvhFt6fe3qTGE%3D&reserved=0), you can still use the previous user interface by choosing your profile icon and selecting **Preview features** from the drop-down menu.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open Preview features](../project/navigation/_img/manage-features/choose-preview-features-vert.png)

Then, switch the **New Navigation** option to **Off**.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Turning off the new navigation UI](_img/turn-off-new-nav.png)

Turning off **New Navigation** also changes the Azure DevOps Services names to the corresponding old VSTS feature names, such as **Work** instead of **Boards**.

To return to the Azure DevOps service-oriented UI, choose your profile icon, select **Preview features**, and re-enable **New Navigation**.

## What about Team Foundation Server (TFS)?

As of September 10, 2018, [Team Foundation Server](/tfs/index) (TFS) is unchanged and fully supported as our on-premises Agile workflow and DevOps product. The latest version is TFS 2018. The latest servicing update is Team Foundation Server 2018 Update 3, which was released on August 28, 2018.
