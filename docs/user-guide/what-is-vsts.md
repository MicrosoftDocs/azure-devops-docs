# What is VSTS?

**VSTS**

Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) is a cloud service for collaborating on code development. It provides an integrated set of features that you access through your web browser or IDE client, including: 

- Git repositories for source control of your code   
- Build and release management to support continuous integration and delivery of your apps 
- Agile tools to support planning and tracking your work, code defects, and issues using Kanban and Scrum methods 
- A variety of tools to test your apps, including manual/exploratory testing, load testing, and continuous testing 
- Highly customizable dashboards for sharing progress and trends 
- Built-in wiki for sharing information with your team 

In addition, the VSTS ecosystem provides support for adding extensions, integrating with other popular services, such as: Campfire, Slack, Trello, UserVoice, and more, and developing your own custom extensions.  

Choose VSTS when you want quick setup, maintenance-free operations, easy collaboration across domains, elastic scale, and rock solid security. You'll also have access to cloud load testing, cloud build servers, and application insights.
