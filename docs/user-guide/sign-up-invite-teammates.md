# Sign up for a free VSTS account and invite others to join your team

**VSTS**
 
Sign up for a VSTS 
account to upload and share code in a free unlimited private 
Git repository. You can then connect to your favorite development tool like Eclipse, Xcode, 
Visual Studio, IntelliJ, or Android Studio to work on apps anytime, anywhere. 

<a name="MicrosoftAccount"></a>

## Sign up with a personal Microsoft account

0.	Right-click the sign-up link, [VSTS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137&clcid=0x409), and enter 
your email address for your Microsoft account. 

	If you're a Visual Studio subscriber 
	and get VSTS as a benefit, 
	use the Microsoft account associated with your subscription. 

	<img src="../accounts/_img/_shared/sign-in.png" alt="Enter your email address" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

0.	On the Microsoft account sign-in page, 
enter your email address for your Microsoft account. 
Then enter your password, and finish signing in.

	<img src="../accounts/_img/_shared/sign-in-msa2.png" alt="Enter password for your Microsoft account" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	If you don't have a Microsoft account, 
	you can create a Microsoft account at this time. 

0.	Enter a name for your account. The name you enter cannot contain spaces or special characters (such as / \ [ ] : | < > + = ; ? or &#42;), cannot end in a period or comma, must be less than 256 characters, and must be unique within the VSTS namespace. 

	To manage your code, choose Git or Team Foundation Version Control.

	<img src="../accounts/_img/sign-up-visual-studio-team-services/create-team-services-account.png" alt="Name your VSTS account, choose your version control" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	Choose Git for distributed source control and TFVC for centralized source control. To learn more, review [Git](../git/overview.md) 
	or [Team Foundation Version Control](../tfvc/overview.md).

0.	(Optional) Click **Change details** to change default assignments. Otherwise, click **Continue** to confirm to initiate your account creation.

	<img src="../accounts/_img/sign-up-visual-studio-team-services/check-account-location-standard.png" alt="Rename team project, change account location, or select another process" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	To change default assignments, use this guidance:

	- **Project name**: You can specify your team project name. The name you enter cannot contain spaces or special characters (such as / : \ ~ & % ; @ ' " ? < > | # $ &#42; } { , + = [ ], cannot begin with an underscore or begin or end with a period, and must be 64 characters or less.
   - **Organize work using**: The default work tracking process is set to **Agile**. If you want to work with Scrum or CMMI processes, then select those now.  You can't change the process after the team project is created. (To learn more, see [Choose process](../work/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md). 
   - **Host your projects in**: You can choose between [several locations for where you want your data hosted](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/privacy/vsts-location).
 
	<img src="_img/sign-up/change-details.png" alt="Choose details for your VSTS account" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

0.	By default, VSTS creates your first team project as "MyFirstProject". After VSTS creates your account and team project, 
you can invite others to join your project, add code, start planning and tracking using work items, or rename your team project. 

	<img src="../accounts/_img/_shared/team-project-created.png" alt="Add code or work items" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	Congratulations, you're now a VSTS account owner! 

	To sign in to your account at any time, go to ```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com```.
