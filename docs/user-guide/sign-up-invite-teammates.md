## Invite teammates (add users to your organization)

After you create an organization, add teammates so they can access projects and repositories.

Quick invite steps
1. Open your organization settings and choose **Organization settings** > **Users** (or **Manage users**).
2. Select **Invite users** and enter email addresses. Assign access levels and project roles as needed.
3. Optionally, add users to teams or groups to control permissions and project access.

For detailed steps, see:
- [Add users to your organization](../organizations/accounts/add-organization-users.md)
- [Add users or groups to a team or project](../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md)
