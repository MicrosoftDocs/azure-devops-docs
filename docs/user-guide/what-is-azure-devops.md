# What is Azure DevOps?

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-all-versions](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Azure DevOps provides developer services to support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Developers can work in the cloud using Azure DevOps Services or on-premises using Azure DevOps Server. Azure DevOps Server was formerly named Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS).

Azure DevOps provides integrated features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client. You can use one or more of the following services based on your business needs:

- **Azure Repos** provides Git repositories or Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) for source control of your code
- **Azure Pipelines** provides build and release services to support continuous integration and delivery of your apps
- **Azure Boards** delivers a suite of Agile tools to support planning and tracking work, code defects, and issues using Kanban and Scrum methods
- **Azure Test Plans** provides several tools to test your apps, including manual/exploratory testing and continuous testing
- **Azure Artifacts** allows teams to share Maven, npm, and NuGet packages from public and private sources and integrate package sharing into your CI/CD pipelines

You can also use collaboration tools such as:

- Customizable team dashboards with configurable widgets to share information, progress, and trends
- Built-in wikis for sharing information
- Configurable notifications

Azure DevOps supports adding extensions and integrating with other popular services, such as: Campfire, Slack, Trello, UserVoice, and more, and developing your own custom extensions.  

For information on the differences between the cloud versus on-premises platforms, see [Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server](about-azure-devops-services-tfs.md).

<a name="name-changes"></a>Microsoft renamed Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to Azure DevOps Services. For more information about this change, see [Introducing Azure DevOps](https://aka.ms/azurevsts).

Team Foundation Server became Azure DevOps Server 2019.

## Choose Azure DevOps Services

Choose Azure DevOps Services when you want:

- Quick set-up
- Maintenance-free operations
- Easy collaboration across domains
- Elastic scale
- Rock-solid security

To learn more about data protection in Azure DevOps Services, see [Data protection overview](../organizations/security/data-protection.md).

Azure DevOps Services also gives you access to cloud build and deployment servers, and application insights.

We've made it easy for you to start for free and try out our services. Sign up for free by creating an organization. Then, either upload your code to share or source control. Begin tracking your work using Scrum, Kanban, or a combination of methods.

You can use all the services included with Azure DevOps, or choose just what you need to complement your existing workflows.

- **[Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards/)**. Plan, track, and discuss work across your teams.
- **[Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/)**. Continuously build, test, and deploy to any platform and cloud.
- **[Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/)**. Get unlimited, cloud-hosted private Git repositories for your project.

## Choose Azure DevOps Server

Choose on-premises Azure DevOps Server when you need:

- Your data to stay within your network.
- Your work tracking customization requirements are met better with the on-premises XML process model over the inheritance process model. The on-premises model supports modification of XML definition files.

When you deploy Azure DevOps Server, you can also configure the following servers or integration points:

- **Build server** supports on-premises and cloud-hosted builds.
- **SQL Server and SQL Analysis Server** support SQL Server Reports and the ability to create Excel pivot charts based on the cube.

Start for free by downloading [Azure DevOps Server Express](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2041269&clcid=0x409). Then, either upload your code to share or source control. Or, begin tracking your work using Scrum, Kanban, or a combination of methods.

To learn more about managing Azure DevOps Server, see the [Administrative tasks quick reference](/azure/devops/server/admin/admin-quick-ref).

## Visual Studio Team Services is now Azure DevOps Services<a id="vsts" />

Many of the featured services in VSTS are now offered as standalone services in both Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019. You can get services separately or all together as Azure DevOps Services. If you're an Azure DevOps subscriber, you have access to all of the services already.

> | VSTS feature name    | Azure DevOps service name | Description |
> |----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
> | Build & release      | Azure Pipelines      | Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) that works with any language, platform, and cloud. |
> | Code                 | Azure Repos          | Unlimited cloud-hosted private Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repositories for your project. |
> | Work                 | Azure Boards         | Work tracking with Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting. |
> | Test                 | Azure Test Plans     | All-in-one planned and exploratory testing solution. |
> | Packages (extension) | Azure Artifacts      | Maven, npm, and NuGet package feeds from public and private sources. |

Both Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019 use the new navigation user interface, with a vertical sidebar to navigate to the main service areas: **Boards**, **Repos**, **Pipelines**, and more. To learn more, see [Web portal navigation in Azure DevOps](../project/navigation/index.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can disable select services from the user interface. For more information, see [Turn a service on or off](../organizations/settings/set-services.md).

You can still use `visualstudio.com` to access Azure DevOps Services. We've moved to the new `dev.azure.com` domain name as the primary URL for new organizations. That URL is `https://dev.azure.com/{your organization}/{your project}`. If you want to change your URL to be based on `dev.azure.com` as the primary, an organization administrator can do so from the organization settings page.

## Choose your content version

This content supports a platform/version selector. Toggle the Content version selector dropdown, located above the table of contents, to access the content that is specific to your version. The table of contents and content page refresh to show only that content specific to the selected version.
