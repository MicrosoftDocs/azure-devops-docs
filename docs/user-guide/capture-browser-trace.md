# Capture a browser trace for troubleshooting

If you're troubleshooting an issue with Azure DevOps and need to contact [Microsoft Support](provide-feedback.md), capture additional information such as a browser trace, step recording, and console output. This data provides important details about what is happening in Azure DevOps when the issue occurs.

A HAR (HTTP Archive) file tracks information between a web browser and a website. It contains detailed performance data about web pages, including resources loaded, time taken for each resource, and any errors encountered. Sharing a HAR file with Microsoft Support can help diagnose and resolve issues more effectively.

> [!WARNING]
> Browser traces often contain sensitive information and might include authentication tokens linked to your identity. Remove any passwords before sharing traces with others. Handle these HAR files with care to ensure the security and privacy of the contained information. Microsoft support uses these traces for troubleshooting purposes only.

## Generate HAR file and record browser activity

You can capture this information from Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome. Steps for each browser are shown as follows.

# [Microsoft Edge](#tab/microsoft-edge)

The following steps show how to use the developer tools in Microsoft Edge. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge DevTools](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium).

> [!NOTE]
> The screenshots in this article show the DevTools in Focus Mode with a vertical **Activity Bar**. Depending on your settings, your configuration might look different. For more information, see [Simplify DevTools using Focus Mode](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/experimental-features/focus-mode).

1. In your browser, select **F12** > **Open DevTools**.
2. Select :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **more actions**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/microsoft-edge-select-more-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows three dots highlighted for selection, more actions.":::

3. Select **Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/microsoft-edge-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows highlighted Settings selection.":::

4. Under **Preferences**, scroll to the **Network** section and enter a check in the box next to **Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/microsoft-edge-network-preferences.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows checkmark next to Microsoft Edge network preference, Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data.":::

5. Close the settings menu.
6. Ensure the **Network** tab is set to **Preserve log** and is capturing traffic.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/microsoft-edge-network-tab-check-preserve-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows check next to Preserve log in Network tab in Microsoft Edge.":::

7. Go to the step before where the issue occurs.
8. Record the steps you take in Azure DevOps using [Steps Recorder](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/record-steps-to-reproduce-a-problem-46582a9b-620f-2e36-00c9-04e25d784e47). Steps Recorder doesn't automatically start recording HAR traces in DevTools, so make sure to start the recording in DevTools, too.
9. When you're done recording, stop recording in Step Recorder. In DevTools, stop recording and long press **Export** so that it shows a menu. If you only do a short press, a sanitized version of the HAR gets exported, which is missing information needed for troubleshooting. 

10. Select **Export HAR (with sensitive data)**.	 

    :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/microsoft-edge-export-har-with-sensitive-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows highlighted selection Export HAR with sensitive data in Microsoft Edge.":::

11. (Optional) Uncheck the "Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data" box when you're done.

# [Google Chrome](#tab/google-chrome)

The following steps show how to use the developer tools in Google Chrome. For more information, see [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).

1. In your browser, select **F12**.
2. Select :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/gear-icon.png" border="false"::: **Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/google-chrome-gear.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a gear highlighted for selection, more actions.":::

3. Under Preferences, scroll to the Network section, and enter a check in the box next to **Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/google-chrome-network-preferences.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows checkmark next to Google Chrome network preference, Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data.":::

4. Close the settings menu.
5. Ensure the **Network** tab is set to **Preserve log** and is capturing traffic.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/google-chrome-network-tab-check-preserve-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows check next to Preserve log in Network tab in Google Chrome.":::

6. Go to the step before where the issue occurs.
7. Start recording the steps you take in Azure DevOps, using [Steps Recorder](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/record-steps-to-reproduce-a-problem-46582a9b-620f-2e36-00c9-04e25d784e47).
8. When you're done recording, long press the export button so that it shows a menu. If you only do a short press, a sanitized version of the HAR gets exported, which is missing information needed for troubleshooting.
9.  Select **Export HAR (with sensitive data)**.	 

    :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/google-chrome-export-har-with-sensitive-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows highlighted selection, Export HAR (with sensitive data), in Google Chrome.":::

10. (Optional) Uncheck the "Allow to generate HAR with sensitive data" box when you're done.
