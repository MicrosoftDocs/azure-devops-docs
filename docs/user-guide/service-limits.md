# Service and rate limits for Azure DevOps Services

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure DevOps Services, like many Software-as-a-Service solutions, uses multi-tenancy to reduce costs and to enhance scalability and performance. This leaves users vulnerable to performance issues and even outages when other users of their shared resources have spikes in their consumption. To combat these problems, Azure DevOps Services limits the resources individuals can consume and the number of requests they can make to certain commands. When these limits are exceeded, subsequent requests may be either delayed or blocked. 

This article specifies certain limits placed on the use and configuration of Azure DevOps services. For more information, see 
[Rate limits](../integrate/concepts/rate-limits.md) and [Work tracking, process, and project limits](../organizations/settings/work/object-limits.md). 
 

## Work items

- A long text field can contain 1M characters.
- You can't assign more than 100 tags to a work item.
- You can't add more than 1,000 links to a work item.
- You can't add more than 100 attachments to a work item.
- You can't add an attachment size larger than 60 MB to a work item.
- You can have up to 1,000 tasks on a task board
- You can have up to 10,000 work items on a backlog
- You are limited to 5,000 teams in a project
- You can't create more than 150,000 tag definitions per project


## Area and iteration paths

| Configuration object |  Limit | 
|--------|-------|
| Projects | 1000 per organization for Azure DevOps Services</br>No prescribed limit for on-premises</br>(See also [Work tracking, process, and project limits](../organizations/settings/work/object-limits.md#projects) | 
| Teams | 5,000 per organization | 
| Work item tags | 150,000 tag definitions per organization | 
| Area Paths | 10,000 per organization | 
| Area Path Depth | 14 | 
| Area Paths per team | 300 | 
| Iteration Paths | 10,000 per organization | 
| Iteration Path Depth | 14 | 
| Iteration Paths per team | 300 | 


## Queries

- The execution time limit for queries is 30 seconds. See [Optimization best practices](../integrate/concepts/integration-bestpractices.md#optimize-queries) to improve query performance.
- Query results are limited to 20,000
- Queries are limited in length to 32,000 characters

## Process customization

When customizing the work item types (WITs) defined in the Inheritance or Hosted XML process models, be aware of the limits placed on objects defined in [Work tracking, process, and project limits](../organizations/settings/work/object-limits.md).
 
## Dashboards

A limit is placed on 500 dashboards per project. 

## Wiki

Wikis defined for a project are limited to 1 GB per git repository. 

> [!TIP]    
> To derive the size of a wiki/git repository, download the repo to your local computer, unzip the file, and then open the **Properties** for the corresponding folder.
