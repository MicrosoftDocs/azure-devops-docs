# Quickstart: Plan and track your work

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

In this quickstart, you learn how to do the following tasks:
- add and view work items for your project from the web portal
- use different types of work items to track different types of work&mdash;such as:
   - user stories or product backlog items
   - tasks
   - bugs
   - issues
- describe the work to be done
- assign work
- track status
- coordinate efforts within your team

## Prerequisites

You can add work items after you connect to a project. If you don't have an organization or project yet, create one in [Azure DevOps](sign-up-invite-teammates.md).

## Add a work item

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. From your web browser, open the project for your organization. If you don't have a project, [create one now](sign-up-invite-teammates.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get invited now](sign-up-invite-teammates.md#invite-others).

	The web browser URL follows this pattern: ```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}/{yourproject}```  

	You can use this URL to quickly open the project. Replace {yourorganization} and {yourproject} with your specific organization and project name, and then remove the braces.

	If you don't see the project that you want, choose the ![Azure DevOps icon](../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps icon to [browse all projects and teams](../project/navigation/work-across-projects.md).  

	![Browse all projects](_img/plan-track-work/browse-all-projects-vert.png)

2.	Select **Azure Boards** > **Work Items**.

    >![Select Boards and Work Items to create a new work item](_img/plan-track-work/project-select-work-items-vert.png)

3. Choose **New Work Item** and select the work item type that you want. Here, we choose to create a **Feature**.

   >![Choose New Work Item and type](_img/plan-track-work/new-work-item-select-type-vert.png)

4. Enter a title, and then **Save** the work item. Before you can change the **State** from its initial default value, you must save it.  

	That's it!

1. From your web browser, open the project for your organization. If you don't have a project, [create one now](sign-up-invite-teammates.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get invited now](sign-up-invite-teammates.md#invite-others).

	The web browser URL follows this pattern: ```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}/{yourproject}```  

	You can use this URL to quickly open the project. Replace the {organization name} and {project name} with your specific organization and project name, and remove the braces. 

	If you don't see the team or project that you want, choose the ![Azure DevOps icon](../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps icon to [browse all projects and teams](../project/navigation/work-across-projects.md).  

2.	Select **Work** > **New Work Items** and choose the work item type that you want. Here, we choose to create a **User Story**. 

	<img src="../boards/backlogs/_img/add-work-items-choose-user-story.png" alt="Azure DevOps Services, TFS 2017, Work, Add a work item" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" /> 

	If you don't see the **Work** option, your screen size might be reduced. Select the ellipsis (...) (![ellipsis](../_shared/_img/ellipses-reduced-screen-size.png)), then choose **Work** > **New Work Items**, and then choose the work item type that you want.

	![Open Work when screen size is reduced](_img/plan-track-work/open-work-hub-reduced-screen-size.png) 

3. Enter a title, and then save the work item. Before you can change the **State** from its initial default value, you must save it.  

	<img src="../boards/backlogs/_img/add-new-work-item-vsts-user-story.png" alt="Agile process, User story work item form" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

	That's it!

Create as many work items as you need. Use the types that you need to track the work that you want to manage.  

>[!NOTE]  
>Depending on the process that was chosen when the project was created&mdash;[Scrum](../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), 
[Agile](../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), or [CMMI](../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md)&mdash;the types of work items that you can create differ. For example, backlog items might be called product backlog items (Scrum), user stories (Agile), or requirements (CMMI). All three types are similar: they describe the customer value to deliver and the work to perform.
>
> For an overview of all three processes, see [Choose a process](../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).

## View your created work items  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Go to your project and select **Azure Boards** > **Work Items**.

   ![In your project, select Work and Work Items](_img/plan-track-work/project-select-work-items-vert.png)

2. To view any work item in the list, select the title.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

1. Select **Work** > **Work Items** > **My activity**. This page lists all of the work items that you recently viewed, created, or modified.

	<img src="_img/plan-track-work/view-work-item-activity.png" alt="Work, Work Items page, Add a work item" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
