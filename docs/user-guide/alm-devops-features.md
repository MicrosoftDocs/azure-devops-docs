### Workflow




<table>
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td width="33%">


<p><b>What is workflow? </b></p>
<p>You use workflow to track the progress of work as it moves from new, active, to complete or closed. Each workflow consists of a set of states, the valid transitions between the states, and the reasons for transitioning the work item to the selected state.  </p>
![User story workflow](../work/work-items/guidance/_img/ALM_PT_Agile_WF_Bug.png)   

<br/>


<p><b>Default workflows</b></p>
<p>Each process [defines the workflow](../work/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md#main-distinctions) for each work item type to track progress from newly defined, to in progress, to completed or closed. </p>





</td>
<td width="33%">

<p><b>Kanban workflow</b></p>
<p>You can fully customize your Kanban board to map the workflow your team uses by [adding and renaming columns](../work/kanban/add-columns.md)</p>
![Add columns to map your workflow](_img/features/alm-feature-kanban-flow.png)  
<br/>

<p><b>Customize the workflow</b></p>
<p>For VSTS: [add custom workflow states to support your business tracking needs](../work/customize/process/customize-process-workflow.md).  For TFS: [Design your custom workflow](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms194981.aspx) by adding states, transitions, reasons, and optional actions.</p>

 <p><b>States  </b></p>
<p>States allow you to [track the status of work](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms194981.aspx). For  example, a bug moves from **Active**, **Resolved**, and **Closed** to correspond to when it's defined, fixed, and verified as fixed.</p>

<p><b>Transitions</b></p>
<p>Transitions specify the [valid progressions and regressions from state to state](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms194981.aspx) for a work item type.</p>

<p><b>Reasons</b></p>
<p>Each transition [specifies a default reason as well as optional reasons](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms194981.aspx) for tracking the change in state.  </p>



</td>
<td width="33%">

<p><b>Update fields during workflow changes (TFS)  </b></p>
<p>You can [define rules that change a field value](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms194981.aspx) whenever you change the state, perform a transition, or select a reason.   </p>

<p><b>Apply workflow conditional field rules (TFS)  </b></p>
<p>You can define rules that [change a field value based on the contents of other fields](../work/customize/reference/apply-rule-work-item-field.md) during workflow changes. </p>


<p><b>Restrict who can make changes during workflow transitions (TFS)  </b></p>
<p>Set a condition field rule that applies to a group to [restrict who can make changes to a workflow or a field](../work/customize/reference/apply-rule-work-item-field.md).  </p>


<p><b>Event-generated workflow changes or field assignments (TFS)</b></p>
<p>[Add an action](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms194990.aspx) to a custom workflow definition to automatically transition work items or specify a field value based on an internal TFS event or external event. </p>

<p><b>Visual workflow design tool (TFS)</b></p>
<p>You can change the workflow or view the workflow state diagram  by using the [Process Editor](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/898a828a-af00-42c6-bbb2-530dc7b8f2e1), a power tool for Visual Studio. </p>

<p><b>When to use Release Management?</b></p>
<p>Evaluate how Release Management can help you in [your development and deployment efforts](../build-release/overview.md).</p>


<p><b>Release definitions</b></p>
<p>Add a release definition by [choosing the build version, target release environments, and tasks](../build-release/apps/cd/deploy-webdeploy-webapps.md).</p>


<p><b>Release environments</b></p>
<p>[Define and clone release environments](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/environments.md), logical entities that represent where you want to deploy a release, such as a collection of servers, a cloud, multiple clouds, or an app store.</p>


<p><b>Artifacts</b></p>
<p>A release is fundamentally defined by [versioned artifacts that make up the release](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/artifacts.md). As you deploy the release to various environments, you deploy and validate the same artifacts on all environments. </p>


<p><b>Tasks</b></p>
<p>Automate release deployment by [defining the events that will trigger a release](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/triggers.md#release-triggers).</p>

<p><b>Agents and agent pools</b></p>
<p>Agent pools are the execution containers that specify the security context and runtime environment for the [agents that run when you deploy a release](../build-release/concepts/agents/agents.md).</p>

</td>
<td width="33%">
<p><b>Works for any app</b></p>
<p>Deploy [any type of application across multiple platforms](../build-release/overview.md) including Windows and Linux, whether on-premises or in the cloud.</p>

<p><b>Approval workflows</b></p>
<p>Streamline your application release workflow by [routing pre- and post-deployment approvals](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/approvals/index.md) to multiple approvers or teams.</p>

<p><b>Release notifications</b></p>
<p>Receive email messages as releases occur. Approvers receive notifications automatically when a release is waiting for approval. </p>

<p><b>Full traceability</b></p>
<p>Monitor the status of your release pipelines and track every deployment in each of the environments. Retain full audit history of all activities performed on a release with detailed release logs and approval tracking.</p>

<p><b>Release logs</b></p>
<p>View or download log files as zip files. Log files contain the status for each step or task of a release, for each of the environments in the release definition. Each completed release--succeeded, failed, or abandoned--[includes a live log file, details, and history for each step or task](../build-release/actions/define-multistage-release-process.md#monitor-and-track-deployments).</p>

<p><b>Triggers</b></p>
<p>Automate release deployment by [defining the events that will trigger a release](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/triggers.md#release-triggers).</p>

<p><b>Variables</b></p>
<p>Lookup the description for all [release system, global, and agent variables](../build-release/concepts/process/tasks.md).</p>

<p><b>Add release summary to dashboard (VSTS) </b></p>
<p>[Add a release summary chart](../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#release-definition-widget) to a team dashboard. </p>

<p><b>Extend and customize</b></p>
<p>[Create workflows tailored to your process](../build-release/concepts/definitions/release/index.md) by customizing our tasks, or extend with your own custom tasks.</p>
![Customize release definition process](_img/features/alm-feature-release-3.png)  
<br />

<p><b>Manage permissions</b></p>
<p>Grant or deny permissions to [manage release definitions, environments approvers, or release permissions](../build-release/concepts/policies/permissions.md#release-permissions). Set permissions for users, groups, or per release definition. </p>
