# Tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

In this article, learn about the tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 < azure-devops"

Our platform of software development tools began more than 20 years ago. We released Visual Basic and Visual Studio as an integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Studio supports many plug-ins that extend its functionality. In particular, the Team Explorer plug-in allows the Visual Studio client to connect to Azure DevOps to support source control, work tracking, build, and test operations.  

::: moniker-end

The available tools that communicate with Azure DevOps are included as follows:

- Desktop client developer tools
- Office integration tools
- Web-based tools
- Command-line tools
- Marketplace extensions
- REST APIs

## Marketplace extensions

Visual Studio and Azure DevOps provide a wealth of features and functionality. They also provide a means to extend and share that functionality. 

Extensions are simple add-ons that you can use to customize and extend your DevOps and work tracking experiences. They're written with standard technologies&mdash;HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can develop your own extensions by using your preferred dev tools. 

You build extensions by using our RESTful API library. Publish your extensions to the Azure DevOps Marketplace. You can privately maintain or share them with millions of developers who use Visual Studio and Azure DevOps.

To learn more, visit the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) and see [Overview of extensions](../extend/index.md).

## REST APIs  
 
The Azure DevOps APIs are based on REST, OAuth, JSON, and service hooks&mdash;all standard web technologies broadly supported in the industry.

REST APIs are provided to support building extensions to Azure DevOps. To learn more, see [REST API overview](/rest/api/vsts/).
