#Tools and clients that connect to VSTS and TFS

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Our platform of software development tools began over 20 years ago with the releases of Visual Basic and Visual Studio as an integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Studio supports a number of plug-ins which extend its functionality. In particular, the Team Explorer plug-in allows the Visual Studio client to connect to VSTS and TFS to support source control, work tracking, build, and test operations.  

The set of tools available to you that interface with VSTS and TFS include:

- Desktop client developer tools 
- Office integration tools 
- Web based tools
- Command-line tools 
- Marketplace extensions
- REST APIs

## Office integration tools 

When you install any edition of Visual Studio or [Team Foundation Server Standalone Office Integration 2015 (free)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691127), the Team Foundation plug-in installed to integrate work item tracking with select Office clients. The Team Foundation plug-in installs to your existing Office client. The plug-in supports Office 2007, Office 2010, or Office 2013 versions.

- **[Excel](../work/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md)**: Use Excel to add and bulk modify work items.  
- **[Project](../work/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md)**: Using Project you can plan projects, schedule tasks, assign resources, and track changes. You have access to features that TFS doesn't support, such as a project calendar, Gantt charts, and resource views.
- **[Project Professional](../work/tfs-ps-sync/synchronize-tfs-project-server.md)**: With Project Professional and the Team Foundation Server Extensions for Project Server you can manage projects that synchronize data that exists in both TFS and Project Server. Project managers and software development teams can use the tools that they prefer, work at the level of precision that supports their needs, and easily share information.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Support for integrating TFS with Project Server is deprecated for TFS 2017. However, synchronization support is provided by a third party. See  [Synchronize TFS with Project Server](../work/tfs-ps-sync/sync-ps-tfs.md) for details. 

### Task-specific clients

The following clients support specific tasks, such as managing testing efforts, providing feedback, or modifying work items.

- **[Microsoft Test Manager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj635157.aspx)**: Allows you to manage your test efforts, create and run manual tests, and create and track bugs that are found during test efforts. Test Manager installs with Visual Studio Test Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise. 
- **[Test & Feedback extension (previously called the Exploratory Testing extension)](../manual-test/stakeholder/provide-stakeholder-feedback.md)**: Provides a lightweight, plug-in to a web browser. Stakeholders can respond to feedback requests for user stories and features generated in VSTS or TFS. This extension is free to stakeholders. 
- **[Microsoft Feedback Client](../feedback/give-feedback.md)**: Your stakeholders can use **Microsoft Feedback Client** to record feedback for your application as video, audio, or type-written comments. This client installs with all versions of Visual Studio, or can be [installed from the free download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30660). All feedback is stored in the work item data store and requires [stakeholders to have required permissions](../feedback/give-permissions-feedback.md).  
 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Test Manager is deprecated for TFS 2017.  

## Browser-based web tools

### Web portal

The collaboration tools supported through the web portal are summarized under [Essential services](services.md). On VSTS, new features are deployed usually every three weeks, and for TFS, usually quarterly. For release notes, see [VSTS Features Timeline](/vsts/release-notes/index).
 
You can use these browsers to access the web portal (VSTS and TFS).

Version        | Edge        | Internet Explorer | Safari (Mac)   | Firefox     | Chrome
---------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------
VSTS  | most recent | 11 and later      | 9.1 and later  | most recent | most recent
TFS 15         | most recent | 11 and later      | 9.1 and later  | most recent | most recent
TFS 2015       | most recent | 9 and later       | 5 and later    | most recent | most recent
TFS 2013       |             | 9 and later       | 5 and later    | most recent | most recent

Edge, Firefox, and Chrome automatically update themselves, so VSTS and TFS support the most recent version. 

To learn more, see [Work in the web portal](work-web-portal.md).

### Browser-based extensions

The following extensions are available from the Visual Studio Marketplace and are built and maintained by the VSTS product team.

### Application monitoring tools

To monitor your applications you can use Application Insights for web apps or HockeyApp for mobile apps.  

#### Monitor web applications with Application Insights

Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for web developers. Use it to monitor your live web application. It will automatically detect performance anomalies. It includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app. It's designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability. It works for apps on a wide variety of platforms including .NET, Node.js and J2EE, hosted on-premises or in the cloud.  

With Application Insights you can:

- Gain actionable insights through application performance management and instant analytics
- Detect and diagnose exceptions and application performance issues

## Command-line tools

You can perform many code development and administrative tasks using command line tools.

- [Git commands](../git/command-prompt.md)
- [TFVC commands](../tfvc/use-team-foundation-version-control-commands.md)
- [TFSConfig](/tfs/server/ref/command-line/tfsconfig-cmd)
- [TFSDeleteProject](/tfs/server/ref/command-line/tfsdeleteproject-cmd)
- [TFSSecurity](/tfs/server/ref/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd)
- [TFSServiceControl](/tfs/server/ref/command-line/tfsservicecontrol-cmd)
- [witadmin (work item tracking)](../work/customize/reference/witadmin/witadmin-customize-and-manage-objects-for-tracking-work.md) 


## Marketplace extensions

While Visual Studio, VSTS, and TFS provide a wealth of features and functionality, they also provide a means to extend and share that functionality. 

Extensions are simple add-ons that you can use to customize and extend your DevOps and work tracking experiences. Written with standard technologies&mdash;HTML, JavaScript, CSS&mdash;you can develop your own extensions using your preferred dev tools. 

You build extensions using our RESTful API Library. You publish them to the Visual Studio Marketplace, where you can privately maintain them or share with millions of developers that use  Visual Studio, VSTS, and TFS.

To learn more, visit the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) and [Overview of extensions](../extend/index.md).

## REST APIs  
 
The VSTS and TFS APIs are based on REST, OAuth, Json and service hooks&mdash;all standard web technologies broadly supported in the industry.

REST APIs are provided to support building extensions to VSTS and TFS. To learn more, see [REST API overview](https://visualstudio.com/integrate/api/overview.md).
