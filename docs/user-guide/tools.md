# Which tools and clients connect to Azure DevOps Services and TFS?

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Learn about the tools and clients that can connect to Azure DevOps Services and TFS.

Our platform of software development tools began more than 20 years ago. We released Visual Basic and Visual Studio as an integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Studio supports many plug-ins that extend its functionality. In particular, the Team Explorer plug-in allows the Visual Studio client to connect to Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server (TFS) to support source control, work tracking, build, and test operations.  

The available tools that communicate with Azure DevOps Services and TFS are included as follows:

- Desktop client developer tools
- Office integration tools
- Web-based tools
- Command-line tools
- Marketplace extensions
- REST APIs

## Office integration tools

When you install any edition of Visual Studio or [Team Foundation Server Standalone Office Integration 2015 (free)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691127), the Team Foundation plug-in is installed to integrate work item tracking with select Office clients. The Team Foundation plug-in installs to your existing Office client. The plug-in supports Office 2007, Office 2010, or Office 2013 versions.

- [Excel](../boards/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md): Use Excel to add and bulk modify work items.  
- [Project](../boards/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md): By using Project, you can plan projects, schedule tasks, assign resources, and track changes. You have access to features that TFS doesn't support, such as a project calendar, Gantt charts, and resource views.
- [Project Professional](../reference/tfs-ps-sync/synchronize-tfs-project-server.md): With Project Professional and the Team Foundation Server Extensions for Project Server, you can manage projects that synchronize data that exists in both TFS and Project Server. Project managers and software development teams can use the tools that they prefer, work at the level of precision that supports their needs, and easily share information.
- [PowerPoint Storyboarding](../boards/backlogs/office/storyboard-your-ideas-using-powerpoint.md): Illustrate user stories and requirements by using PowerPoint. The Team Foundation plug-in installs to your existing PowerPoint client.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Support for integrating TFS with Project Server is deprecated for TFS 2017. However, synchronization support is provided by a Microsoft partner. See [Synchronize TFS with Project Server](../reference/tfs-ps-sync/sync-ps-tfs.md) for details.

### Task-specific clients

The following clients support specific tasks, such as managing testing efforts, providing feedback, or modifying work items:

- [Microsoft Test Manager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj635157.aspx): Manage your test efforts, create and run manual tests, and create and track bugs that are found during test efforts. Test Manager is installed with Visual Studio Test Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise. 
- [Test & Feedback extension (previously called the Exploratory Testing extension)](../test/provide-stakeholder-feedback.md): This extension provides a lightweight plug-in to a web browser. Stakeholders can respond to feedback requests for user stories and features generated in Azure DevOps Services or TFS. This extension is free to stakeholders. 
- [Microsoft Feedback Client](../project/feedback/give-feedback.md): Your stakeholders can use this client to record feedback for your application as video, audio, or type-written comments. This client is installed with all versions of Visual Studio, or it can be [installed from the free download](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=48142). All feedback is stored in the work item data store and requires [stakeholders to have permissions](../project/feedback/give-permissions-feedback.md).  
 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>Test Manager is deprecated for TFS 2017.  

## Browser-based web tools

### Web portal

The collaboration tools supported through the web portal are summarized under [Essential services](services.md). New features are usually deployed every three weeks for Azure DevOps Services, and quarterly for TFS. For release notes, see [Azure DevOps Services Features Timeline](/../release-notes/index).
 
You can use these browsers to access the web portal (Azure DevOps Services and TFS):

Version        | Edge        | Internet Explorer | Safari (Mac)   | Firefox     | Chrome
---------------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|-------------
Azure DevOps Services  | most recent | 11 and later      | 9.1 and later  | most recent | most recent
TFS 15         | most recent | 11 and later      | 9.1 and later  | most recent | most recent
TFS 2015       | most recent | 9 and later       | 5 and later    | most recent | most recent
TFS 2013       |             | 9 and later       | 5 and later    | most recent | most recent

Edge, Firefox, and Chrome automatically update themselves, so Azure DevOps Services and TFS support the most recent version.

## Marketplace extensions

Visual Studio, Azure DevOps Services, and TFS provide a wealth of features and functionality. They also provide a means to extend and share that functionality. 

Extensions are simple add-ons that you can use to customize and extend your DevOps and work tracking experiences. They're written with standard technologies&mdash;HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. You can develop your own extensions by using your preferred dev tools. 

You build extensions by using our RESTful API library. You publish them to the Azure DevOps Marketplace, where you can privately maintain them or share them with millions of developers who use  Visual Studio, Azure DevOps Services, and TFS.

To learn more, visit the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) and see [Overview of extensions](../extend/index.md).

## REST APIs  
 
The Azure DevOps Services and TFS APIs are based on REST, OAuth, JSON, and service hooks&mdash;all standard web technologies broadly supported in the industry.

REST APIs are provided to support building extensions to Azure DevOps Services and TFS. To learn more, see [REST API overview](/rest/api/vsts/).
