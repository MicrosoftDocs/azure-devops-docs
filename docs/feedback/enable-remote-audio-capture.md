# Enable remote audio capture

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

To record audio, you must have an audio recording device configured on your computer, or on a remote machine if you access Microsoft Feedback Client, Test Runner, or Exploratory Testing from a remote device.  
  
To record audio as part of a feedback or testing session on a remote machine that is running Microsoft Feedback Client, Test Runner, or Exploratory Testing window, you must configure audio redirection settings on the remote machine. You must also enable record from this computer when you connect to the remote machine. You can perform this procedure only if your local computer is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  We recommend that you open Microsoft Feedback Client on your local computer. Redirection will decrease audio quality. Microsoft Feedback Client does not require you to record audio as part of the feedback session.
