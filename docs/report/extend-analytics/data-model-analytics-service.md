# Data model for Analytics  


[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-azure-devops.md)]

Analytics data model for Azure DevOps consists of entity sets, whose members (entities) contains properties that can be filtered, aggregated, and summarized. Additionally, they contain [navigation properties](http://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/#relationship) that relate entities to one other, providing access to additional properties for selecting, filtering, and grouping.

## Entities  

> [!NOTE]  
>Entity sets are described in OData metadata, and vary by project. A complete list of entity sets, entity types, and properties can be discovered by requesting the OData metadata for your project: 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```OData
> https://analytics.dev.azure.com/{OrganizationName}/{ProjectName}/_odata/{version}/$metadata
> ``` 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```OData
> https://{servername}:{port}/tfs/{OrganizationName}/{ProjectName}/_odata/{version}/$metadata
> ```

::: moniker-end

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/api-versioning.md)]

The following EntitySets are supported with the indicated API versions. For the latest version information, see [OData API versioning](odata-api-version.md).

## Composite entities

Composite entities support specific scenarios. They are composed from simpler entities, often require more computing resources to generate, and may return larger result sets. To achieve the best performance and avoid unnecessary throttling, ensure that you query the correct entity for your scenario.

For example, WorkItemSnapshot combines WorkItemRevisions and Dates such that each date has one revision for each work item. This representation supports OData queries that focus on trend data for a filtered set of work items. However, you should not use this composite entity to query the current state of work items. Instead, you should use the WorkItems entity set to generate a more quick-running query.

Similarly, some entities may contain all historic values, while others may only contain current values. WorkItemRevision contains all work item history, which you should not use in scenarios where the current values are of interest.

## Relationships

To generate more complex query results, you can combine entities using relationships. You can employ relationships to expand, filter, or summarize data.

Some navigation properties result in a single entity, while others result in a collection of entities. The following diagram shows select entities and their navigation properties. For clarity, some composite entities and relationships have been omitted.

## Relationship keys

 Entity relationships are also represented as foreign keys so that external tools can join entities. These properties have the suffix "SK", and are either integer or GUID data types. Date properties have corresponding integer date key properties with the following format: YYYYMMDD.

## Entity Properties

The following table provides a partial list of the WorkItemRevision entity properties to illustrate some common details. The last three properties&mdash;CreatedDate, CreatedDateSK, CreatedOn&mdash;show that the same value is often expressed in multiple properties, each designed for different scenarios.

| Property | Type | Description|  
|--------|------------|------------|  
|WorkItemRevisionSK | Int32 | The Analytics unique key for the work item revision - used by external tools to join related entities.
|WorkItemId | Int32 | The Id for the work item.
|Revision | Int32 | The revision of the work item. 
|Title | String | The work item title. 
|WorkItemType | String | The work item type (e.g. Bug, Task, User Story).
|StoryPoints | Double | The points assigned to this work item - commonly aggregated as a sum.
| Tags | Navigation | Navigation property to a Tag entity collection. Commonly used in ```$expand``` statements to access the Name property for multiple work item tags.
|CreatedDate | DateTimeOffset | The date the work item was created, expressed in the [time zone defined for the organization](../../organizations/accounts/change-organization-location.md). Commonly used for filtering and for display.
|CreatedDateSK | Int32 | The date the work item was created, expressed as YYYYMMDD in the time zone defined for the organization. Used by external tools to join related entities.
|CreatedOn | Navigation | Navigation property to the Date entity for the date the work item was created, in the time zone defined for the organization. Commonly used to reference properties from the Date entity in ```groupby``` statements.

> [!NOTE]
>Changes to custom work item fields will affect the shape of your data model and will affect all work item revisions. For instance, if you add a new field, queries on pre-existing revision data will reflect the presence of the new field.
