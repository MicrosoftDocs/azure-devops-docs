# OData batch support


[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-azure-devops.md)]

Batch requests are part of the OData spec, and Analytics for Azure DevOps provides limited support, as a means to submit large requests. For more information about batch operations in OData see section [11.7 Batch Requests](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Toc453752313) of the OData spec.

## The Analytics $batch endpoint

The $batch endpoint is located at:

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```OData
 https://analytics.dev.azure.com/{OrganizationName}/{ProjectName}/_odata/{version}/$batch
``` 


> [!NOTE]
> The $batch endpoint is not available with a project scope, but the queries within a batch can contain project scoping.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```OData
https://{servername}:{port}/tfs/{OrganizationName}/{ProjectName}/_odata/{version}/$batch
```

> [!NOTE]
> The examples shown in this document are based on a Azure DevOps Services URL, you will need to substitute in your Azure DevOps Server URL.
> The $batch endpoint is not available with a project scope, but the queries within a batch can contain project scoping.

### Supported $batch operations

The OData spec allows for numerous operations per $batch request, however Analytics limits each $batch request to a single query. The Analytics $batch endpoint is also read-only, no change sets may be published to it.

### When to use $batch queries

Use $batch requests when you are in danger of exceeding the browser's limit on URL length. Many modern browsers have these limits and exceeding them can result in undesirable behavior. Using a $batch request allows long queries to be issued against Analytics as the OData query is delivered in a POST body. You may use $batch requests for all your queries, though GET requests are slightly faster.
