# OData batch support


[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Batch requests are part of the OData spec, and the Analytics service for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) provides limited support, as a means to submit large requests. For more information about batch operations in OData see section [11.7 Batch Requests](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata03/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata03-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Toc453752313) of the OData spec.

## The Analytics $batch endpoint
The $batch endpoint is located at ```https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/{version}/$batch```. Note that the $batch endpoint is not available with a project scope, but the queries within a batch can contain project scoping.

### Supported $batch operations
The OData spec allows for numerous operations per $batch request, however the Analytics service limits each $batch request to a single query. The Analytics $batch endpoint is also read-only, no change sets may be published to it.

### When to use $batch queries
Use $batch requests when you are in danger of exceeding the browser's limit on URL length. Many modern browsers have these limits and exceeding them can result in undesirable behavior. Using a $batch request allows long queries to be issued against the Analytics service as the OData query is delivered in a POST body. You may use $batch requests for all your queries, though GET requests are slightly faster.
