# Disable the data warehouse and cube

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-report-platform-version.md)]

Follow the steps below to disable the data warehouse and cube on your Azure DevOps Server instance.

<a id="prerequisites">  </a>
## Prerequisites 

In order to disable the data warehouse and cube, you must have an Azure DevOps Server instance already [set up](/azure/devops/server/install/get-started).

> [!NOTE]  
> Your Azure DevOps Server instance does not need to be provisioned with [SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/?view=tfs-2018) to disable the data warehouse and cube.

1. Launch the **Azure DevOps Server Adminstration Console** on your Azure DevOps Server instance.
2. Navigate to **Reporting**.
