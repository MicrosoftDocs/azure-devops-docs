# Current Work Item tables

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-report-platform-version.md)]


You can query for data about the current state of bugs, tasks, and other types of work items by using the FactCurrentWorkItem table and the associated dimension tables.  
  
 For information about the measures and dimensions that are associated with these tables in the SQL Server Analysis Services cube, see [Test cases and work items](perspective-test-analyze-report-work.md).
