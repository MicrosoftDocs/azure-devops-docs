# Build Details tables

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-report-platform-version.md)]

You can query for data about builds, such as the status and quality, by using FactBuildDetails and the associated dimension tables.  
  
 For information about the measures and dimensions that are associated with these tables in the SQL Server Analysis Services cube, see [Builds](perspective-build-analyze-report-build-details-coverage.md).  
  
 ![Tables for Builds](_img/teamproj_factbuilddetails.png "TeamProj_FactBuildDetails")

-   DimBuild  
  
-   DimBuildQuality  
  
-   DimBuildStatus  
  
-   DimDate  
  
-   DimPerson
