# SQL Server Reporting  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-report-platform-version.md)]

The SQL Server reporting solution is based on a [data warehouse and OLAP cube](components-data-warehouse.md) coupled with a SQL Server Reporting server to host reports.

::: moniker range="azdevserver-2019"
Azure DevOps Server 2019 supports both the SQL Server Reporting solution and the [Analytics Service](../analytics/what-is-analytics.md). To learn more about the future of reporting for the Azure DevOps Server, read [Reporting roadmap](../analytics/reporting-roadmap.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Integration with the data warehouse and SQL Server Reporting Services is only supported for on-premises Azure DevOps Server 2019 and Team Foundation Server (TFS). If you don't have a reporting site and want to add it, see [Add reports to a project](../admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/toc.json).  
> 
> For information on what is supported for Azure DevOps Services, see [Dashboards and reports overview](../dashboards/overview.md).
