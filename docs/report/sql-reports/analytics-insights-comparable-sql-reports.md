# Get Analytics insights comparable to those provided by SQL Reporting Services reports 


[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019-lt-azure-devops](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019-lt-azure-devops.md)]
  

You can get similar insights into your Azure DevOps processes made available through the legacy SQL Server Reporting Services reports using the Analytics service. This article provides guidance for migrating from each [SQL Server Reporting Services reports](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/sql-reports/reporting-services-reports) to using the Analytics service. 

 ## Prerequisites
 
To access data available from the Analytics service, you must meet the following criteria:  
 
- You must be a member of the projects from which you want to view data. If you haven't been added as a project member, [get added now](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). 
- Have the **View Analytics** permission set to **Allow**. See [Grant permissions  to access Analytics](../powerbi/analytics-security.md). Anyone with this permission, except those granted **Stakeholder** access, can view Analytics data.
- Have [enabled or installed Analytics](../dashboards/analytics-extension.md). You must be an account owner or a member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../../organizations/security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md) to enable the service. 
- The service for which data is collected must be enabled. For example, **Boards** must be enabled to view work tracking data. To re-enable it, see [Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md). 
- To use Power BI, have installed a recent version of Power BI Desktop. You can download this client application from the official [Power BI Desktop download page](/power-bi/desktop-what-is-desktop).

The following table summarizes Analytics reports and widgets that you can use to gain comparable insights to the build reports defined using the SQL Server Reporting services. 

> [!NOTE]
