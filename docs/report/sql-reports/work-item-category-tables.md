# Work Item Category tables

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-report-platform-version.md)]

You can query for categories of work items by using the FactWorkItemToCategory and DimWorkItemCategory tables. You can organize the results of other work item queries by category if you join these tables with the DimWorkItem by using `FactWorkItemToCategory.WorkItemTypeName = DimWorkItem.System_WorkItemType`.  
  
 For information about the measures and dimensions that are associated with these tables in the SQL Server Analysis Services cube, see [Test cases and work items](perspective-test-analyze-report-work.md).
