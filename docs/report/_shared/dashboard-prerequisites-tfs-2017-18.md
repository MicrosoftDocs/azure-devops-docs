## Prerequisites  
- You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet,[ create one](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project). 
- If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-users-team-project).
- Anyone with access to a project, including [stakeholders](/azure/devops/organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder), can view dashboards.
- To add, edit, or manage a team dashboard, you must have **Basic** access or greater and be a team admin, a project admin, or have [dashboard permissions](/azure/devops/report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions). In general, you need to be a team admin for the currently selected team to edit dashboards. Request your current team or project admin to add you as a [team admin](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/add-team-administrator).
