## Prerequisites  

* You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in an [on-premises TFS](/vsts/accounts/create-team-project). 
* If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/vsts/security/add-users-team-project).
* Anyone with access to the team project, including [stakeholders](/vsts/security/security/get-started-stakeholder), can view dashboards.
* To add a widget to a team dashboard, you must be a team admin, a project admin, or have  [dashboard permissions](/vsts/report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions). In general, you need to be a team admin for the currently selected team to edit dashboards. Request your current team or project admin to add you as a [team admin](/vsts/work/scale/add-team-administrator).
