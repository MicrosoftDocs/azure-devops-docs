> [!NOTE]  
>The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this article. These differences result from updates made to Azure DevOps or your on-premises TFS, [options that you or your admin have enabled](/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features), and which process was chosen when creating your project&mdash;[Agile](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process), [Scrum](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process), or [CMMI](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process). However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned. For an overview of changes in the navigation experience, see [Web portal navigation](/azure/devops/project/navigation/index#admin-context).
