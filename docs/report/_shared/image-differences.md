>[!NOTE]  
>The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this topic. These differences result from updates made to VSTS or your on-premises TFS, [options that you or your admin have enabled](/vsts/project/navigation/preview-features), and which process was chosen when creating your team project&mdash;[Agile](/vsts/work/work-items/guidance/agile-process), [Scrum](/vsts/work/work-items/guidance/scrum-process), or [CMMI](/vsts/work/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process). However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned. For an overview of changes in the navigation experience and working within the user and administration contexts, see [Navigation basics](/vsts/project/navigation/index#admin-context).
