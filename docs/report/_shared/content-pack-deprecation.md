<!-- 
>[!IMPORTANT]  
>The Power BI.com Azure DevOps Content Pack was deprecated on November 15, 2017. The Content Pack has been deprecated primarily due to the negative impact it has had on organizations, including throttling end users access. Existing Power BI.com datasets based on the Content Pack are unsupported and you cannot create new data sets, however existing data sets can continue to be refreshed.
>
>The [Analytics Marketplace extension](../analytics/analytics-extension.md) and the [Power BI Desktop connector](../powerbi/data-connector-connect.md) for Azure DevOps are intended to replace and improve on the capabilities of the Content Pack. While the Analytics Marketplace extension currently supports Work Item Tracking data, we will update it to support additional data sources including Tests, Build, Release and Version Control. In the interim, you can use [Azure DevOps REST APIs](/rest/api/vsts/index) as an alternative to the Content Pack to report on these additional data sources. -->
