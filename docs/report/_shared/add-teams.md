## Add other teams

If you work with several teams, and each team wants to work with their own backlog view, velocity chart, and forecast tool, you can [add teams](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/add-teams). Each team then gets access to their own set of Agile tools. Each Agile tool filters work items to only include those whose assigned area paths and iteration paths meet those [set for the team](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings).
