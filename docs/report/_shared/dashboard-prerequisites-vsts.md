## Prerequisites  

- You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, [create one](/vsts/organizations/accounts/set-up-vs). 
- If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/vsts/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users-from-user-hub).
- Anyone with access to a project, including [stakeholders](/vsts/organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder), can view dashboards.
- To add, edit, or manage a team dashboard, you must be a [team admin](/vsts/organizations/settings/add-team-administrator), a project admin, or have [dashboard permissions](/vsts/report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions). In general, you need to be a team member for the currently selected team to edit dashboards.
