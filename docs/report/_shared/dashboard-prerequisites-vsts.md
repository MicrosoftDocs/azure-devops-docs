## Prerequisites  

- You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [VSTS](/vsts/accounts/set-up-vs). 
- If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/vsts/accounts/add-account-users-assign-access-levels).
- Anyone with access to the team project, including [stakeholders](/vsts/security/get-started-stakeholder), can view dashboards.
- To add, edit, or manage a team dashboard, you must be a team admin, a project admin, or have [dashboard permissions](/vsts/report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions). In general, you need to be a team admin for the currently selected team to edit dashboards. Request your current team or project admin to add you as a [team admin](/vsts/work/scale/add-team-administrator).
