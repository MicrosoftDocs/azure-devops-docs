## Open Analytics to access views

After you install the Analytics Marketplace extension, a set of default Analytics views are created for each team project. Open a browser window, connect to your team project, click the **Analytics** hub, and then the **All** page. You can view, modify, and create a custom view from the **Analytics** hub.

If you don't see the team or team project you want, click the ![VSTS icon](/vsts/work/_img/icons/project-icon.png) icon to [browse all team projects and teams](/vsts/user-guide/account-home-pages).
If you don't see the **Analytics** hub, your screen size may be reduced. Click the three dots (![expand menu](/vsts/report/_img/icons/menu-expand-icon.png), then click **Analytics**, and then **Analytics views**.
