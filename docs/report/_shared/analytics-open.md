## Open Analytics to access views

After you install the [Analytics Marketplace extension](../analytics/analytics-extension.md), a set of default Analytics views are created for each team project. You can view, modify, and create a custom view from **Analytics**.

> [!NOTE]
> Your web portal uses either the **New navigation** or **Previous navigation** user interface. Choose the **New navigation** tab if the **New Navigation** feature is enabled. You'll see a vertical sidebar along with other navigational features when **New Navigation** has been enabled for the signed-in user or the organization. Choose **Previous navigation** when you see a top-level, blue-bar&mdash;indicating that **New navigation** isn't enabled. For more information, see [Web portal navigation](/azure/devops/project/navigation/index).
