## Prerequisites  

* You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one. See [Sign up for free](/azure/devops/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates). 
* If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users-from-user-hub). Anyone with access to the team project, except stakeholders, can view Analytics views.
* Have installed the [Analytics Marketplace extension](../analytics/analytics-extension.md). You must be an account owner or a member of the [Project Collection Administrator group](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions) to add extensions.
* **Boards** must be enabled. If disabled, **Analytics views** won't display. To re-enable it, see [Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md).
* Have the **View Analytics** permission set to **Allow**. See [Grant permissions  to access the Analytics Service](/azure/devops/report/analytics/analytics-security).
