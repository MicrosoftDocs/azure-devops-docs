## Prerequisites  

* You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one. See [Sign up for a free VSTS account](/vsts/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates). 
* If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/vsts/accounts/add-account-users-assign-access-levels). Anyone with access to the team project, except stakeholders, can view Analytics views.
* Have installed the [Analytics Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-analytics). You must be an account owner or a member of the [Project Collection Administrator group](/vsts/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions) to add extensions.
* Have the **View Analytics** permission set to Allow. See [Grant permissions  to access the Analytics Service](/vsts/report/analytics/analytics-security).
