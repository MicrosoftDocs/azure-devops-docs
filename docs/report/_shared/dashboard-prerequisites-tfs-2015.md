## Prerequisites  
- You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in an [on-premises TFS](/vsts/accounts/create-team-project). 
- If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/vsts/security/add-users-team-project).
- Anyone with access to the team project, including [stakeholders](/vsts/security/get-started-stakeholderd), can view dashboards.
- To add a widget to a team dashboard, you must be added to the [team administrator role for the team](/vsts/work/scale/add-team-administrator).
