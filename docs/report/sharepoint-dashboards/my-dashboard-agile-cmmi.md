# My Dashboard (Agile and CMMI)

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-sharepoint-version.md)]

You can monitor your tasks and quickly access work items that are assigned to you by using My Dashboard. You can use this dashboard to answer the following questions:  
  
-   What is the next set of tasks, bugs, or test cases that I should act on?  
  
-   What is the status of the team's most recent builds?  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
 See requirements listed in [Project portal dashboards](project-portal-dashboards.md).  
  
##  <a name="Data"></a> Data that appears in the dashboard  
 You can use My Dashboard to review and access your work items. To learn about the Web Parts that are displayed on My Dashboard, refer to the illustration and the table that follow. You can open the list of Tasks, Bugs, and Test Cases in either Team Web Access or Team Explorer by using one of the following team queries: My Tasks, My Bugs, or My Test Cases.

##  <a name="Activities"></a> Required work item tracking activities  
 For the reports that My Dashboard shows to be useful and accurate, the team must perform the following activities:  
  
-   Define tasks, bugs, and test cases, and assign each work item to the team member who is currently working to resolve or close it.  
  
-   Update the **State** of each work item the team fixes, verifies, and closes it.
