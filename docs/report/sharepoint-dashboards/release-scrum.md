# Release (Scrum) dashboard
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-sharepoint-version.md)]

The Release dashboard shows how much work remains in the release and how quickly your team is working through the product backlog. It displays the Release Burndown report, along with additional charts and quick access links.  
  
 ![Release burndown chart](_img/scrum_releaseburndonw.png "Scrum_ReleaseBurndonw")  
  
 To view the dashboard, choose **Go to project portal** from the **Documents** page in Team Explorer or the home page of the web portal.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
 See [Project portal dashboards](project-portal-dashboards.md).

|Web Part|Data displayed|  
|--------------|--------------------|  
|![Step 1](_img/procguid_1.png "ProcGuid_1")|Shows how much work remains at the start of each sprint in a release. This chart doesn't appear when the server that hosts Analysis Services for the team project is unavailable.<br /><br /> The source of the raw data is your product backlog. Each sprint that has been assigned to the team project or team appears along the horizontal axis. The vertical axis indicates the sum of all effort of all active backlog items at the start of each sprint. As the team updates the state of backlog items to Done, the effort remaining decreases. The amount of estimated effort on the vertical axis is in whatever unit that your scrum team has decided to use (for example, story points, size, or hours).<br /><br /> See also [Release Burndown](../sql-reports/release-burndown.md).|
