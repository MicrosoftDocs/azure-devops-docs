# What is Analytics?

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-azure-devops.md)]

Analytics provides the reporting platform for Azure DevOps and Azure DevOps Server. Use it to answer quantitative questions about the past or present state of your projects. This service provides a concise data model over Azure DevOps. Built for reporting, Analytics is optimized for fast read-access and server-based aggregations.

Analytics is enabled for all Azure DevOps Services projects and automatically populates itself with all available Azure DevOps data. Once populated, it updates itself as data changes occur. For more information, read [Data available in Analytics](./data-available-in-analytics.md) and [Performance and latency](performance-latency.md).

Once you've [enabled or installed Analytics](../dashboards/analytics-extension.md), the service populates itself with all available Azure DevOps data. Once populated, it updates itself as data changes occur. For more information, read [Data available in Analytics](./data-available-in-analytics.md) and [Performance and latency](performance-latency.md).

You can access Analytics through dashboard widgets, in-context reports, Power BI, and OData. In addition to the [work tracking widgets](../dashboards/analytics-widgets.md), you can [analyze test results](../../pipelines/test/test-analytics.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/powerbi/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/powerbi/breadcrumb/toc.json) via the test analytic charts for builds and releases. 

## Dashboard widgets

You can create [dashboards](../dashboards/dashboards.md) and [add widgets to them](../dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md). We provide several [widgets based on Analytics](../dashboards/analytics-widgets.md). These widgets take advantage of the power of Analytics. Widgets provide the easiest way to get insights from your data. 

For example, the Velocity widget shown in the following image provides insights into a team's historical performance over six iterations. 

![Analytics - Velocity Widget](_img/what-is-analytics/dashboard-showing-velocity.png)

Here, the Velocity widget shows that this team has a history of closing stories late. It also shows a discrepancy between planned and completed work across all the sprints displayed. The team can drill into the data to determine the root causes. After implementing new practices, the team can use the Velocity widget to track their effectiveness.

Check out [Add an Analytics widget to a dashboard](../dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md#add-analytics-widget) for a step-by-step guide to get started with the Velocity widget.

If you want to develop your own widget based on Analytics, see [Create an Analytics widget](../extend-analytics/example-analytics-widget.md).

## Power BI

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a suite of business analytics tools. Use it to do ad hoc analysis, produce beautiful reports, and publish for enterprise consumption.

The easiest way to pull Azure DevOps data into Power BI is to use the [Power BI Data Connector](data-connector-connect.md). The Azure DevOps Power BI data connector works with Analytics views. For more information, read [What are Analytics views](./what-are-analytics-views.md).

::: moniker-end

Also, you'll find additional ways to pull Azure DevOps data into Power BI as described in [Power BI integration overview](overview.md).

## OData
Analytics is fully accessible via OData. If you would like to prepare custom queries and tooling with our OData API, see [Extend on Analytics](../extend-analytics/index.md).

## Data available in Analytics

At this point, not all data is available via Analytics. For more information, read [Data available in Analytics](./data-available-in-analytics.md).

## Availability for Azure DevOps Server

Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions support Analytics. TFS 2018 and earlier versions do not support Analytics.

For TFS 2018 and earlier, you may use [Dashboards](../dashboards/dashboards.md) with a [variety of widgets](../dashboards/widget-catalog.md) that don't require Analytics. You may also use [SQL Server Reporting](../sql-reports/index.md).
