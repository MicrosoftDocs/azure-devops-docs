# What is Analytics?

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Analytics is the reporting platform for Azure DevOps, replacing the previous platform based on SQL Server Reporting Services. Built for reporting, Analytics is optimized for fast read-access and server-based aggregations. Use it to answer quantitative questions about the past or present state of your projects.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are looking for information about Azure Analysis Services, see 
> [Azure Analysis Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/analysis-services/).

Specifically, Analytics provides you with insights about your Azure DevOps projects through the following tools:

## Data available in Analytics

Analytics is generally available for Azure DevOps Service and Azure DevOps Server 2020 and later versions. It is in preview for Azure DevOps Server 2019. The service provides a concise data model over Azure DevOps. 

Data available via the Analytics service depends on your version and platform.   For specifics, read [Data available in Analytics](./data-available-in-analytics.md) and [Data model for Analytics](../extend-analytics/data-model-analytics-service.md).


::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Analytics is enabled for all Azure DevOps Services projects and automatically populates itself with all available Azure DevOps data. Once populated, it updates itself as data changes occur. For more information, read [Data available in Analytics](./data-available-in-analytics.md) and [Performance and latency](performance-latency.md).

Analytics is enabled for all projects on new project collections and automatically populates itself with all available Azure DevOps data. Once populated, it updates itself as data changes occur. For more information, read [Data available in Analytics](./data-available-in-analytics.md) and [Performance and latency](performance-latency.md).

Once you've [enabled or installed Analytics](../dashboards/analytics-extension.md), the service populates itself with all available Azure DevOps data. Once populated, it updates itself as data changes occur. For more information, read [Data available in Analytics](./data-available-in-analytics.md) and [Performance and latency](performance-latency.md).

## Dashboard widgets

You can create [dashboards](../dashboards/dashboards.md) and [add widgets to them](../dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md). We provide several [widgets based on Analytics](../dashboards/analytics-widgets.md). These widgets take advantage of the power of Analytics. Widgets provide the easiest way to get insights from your data. 

For example, the Velocity widget shown in the following image provides insights into a team's historical performance over six iterations. 

![Analytics - Velocity Widget](media/what-is-analytics/dashboard-showing-velocity.png)

Here, the Velocity widget shows that this team has a history of closing stories late. It also shows a discrepancy between planned and completed work across all the sprints displayed. The team can drill into the data to determine the root causes. After implementing new practices, the team can use the Velocity widget to track their effectiveness.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops"

Check out [Add an Analytics widget to a dashboard](../dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md#add-analytics-widget) for a step-by-step guide to get started with the Velocity widget.

If you want to develop your own widget based on Analytics, see [Create an Analytics widget](../extend-analytics/example-analytics-widget.md).

## In-context reports and roll-up columns 

Work tracking in-context reports are now based on Analytics data. These reports appear on the **Analytics** tab of the product and portfolio backlogs and Kanban boards. Also, there are some pipelines and test in-context reports. To learn more, see the following articles: 

- [Cumulative flow](../dashboards/cumulative-flow.md)
- [Team velocity](../dashboards/team-velocity.md)
- [View/configure sprint burndown](../dashboards/configure-sprint-burndown.md) 
- [Pipeline pass rate report](../../pipelines/reports/pipelinereport.md#pipeline-pass-rate-report)
- [Test failures report](../../pipelines/test/test-analytics.md#test-failures)

Also, you can add rollup columns to product and portfolio backlogs that provide progress bars, counts of work items, or sums of selected fields. For details, see [Display rollup progress or totals](../../boards/backlogs/display-rollup.md).

## Analytic views

Analytics views is a web portal feature that supports filtering work tracking data for status and trend reports. With Analytics views, you can use default or custom views to generate reports in Power BI. Power BI provides a data connector for Analytics views.  quick generation of , you can create and manage Analytics views. 

To learn more, see [What are Analytics views?](what-are-analytics-views.md).
 

## Metadata & OData queries

Analytics is fully accessible via OData. From a web browser, you can query the Analytics metadata or data using an OData query. To learn how, see [Query Analytics in Azure DevOps](../analytics/analytics-query-parts.md).
 
If you would like to prepare custom queries and tooling with our OData API, review [Sample reports and quick reference index](../extend-analytics/quick-ref.md).

## Data connectors and Power BI 

[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a suite of business analytics tools. The following data connectors have been implemented to support importing data into Power BI. 
- Analytics views 
- Odata query
- OData feed
 
With Power BI, you can perform impromptu analysis, produce beautiful reports, and publish dashboards for enterprise consumption.

To get started with Power BI and Azure DevOps Analytics:

- Read the [Power BI integration overview](overview.md)
- Check out the [Power BI Sample Reports](sample-odata-overview.md). They'll get you started quickly on the most popular reports.
 
 
## Support for custom fields and custom work item types

Custom fields and custom work item types are automatically added to the Analytics data model. Through OData queries, you can view the properties and enumerated lists added to the Analytics service based on process customization.
