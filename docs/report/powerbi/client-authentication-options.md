# Enter client credentials in Power BI or Excel 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

When connecting from Power BI or Excel to Analytics using the OData feed, choose Azure Active Directory (**Azure AD**) for the most secure option. The next secure option is the use of Personal Access Tokens (**PATs**).

When connecting from Power BI or Excel to Analytics using the OData feed, choose Windows credentials as the most secure option. The next secure option is the use of Personal Access Tokens (**PATs**).

::: moniker-end

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/analytics-preview.md)]

Why should you use a Personal Access Token over an Alternate Access Credential?

For these three reasons:

- As part of good password management, these tokens automatically expire so you don't have to remember to change your password.
- Since PATs are a generated password, you won't use a common password as part of your AAC, which means a more limited surface area for attack.
- If you need to provide a diagnostic trace and forget to replace the value, you can revoke the credential. Doing so maintains secure access to Azure DevOps.

## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) 

Azure Active Directory is also known as "Organizational Credential" in Power BI Desktop. You can use it in  [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) through OAuth selection when configuring data refresh.

1. When connecting with Power BI Desktop, you'll be prompted to enter your credentials for the data source. Select Organizational account as shown here:

	![Organizational account prompt](media/power-bi-organizational.png) 

2. Choose <strong>Sign in</strong> and enter your Azure AD credentials. After that, you're done.

To change an existing URL to use Azure AD instead of a PAT or AAC, see [Change authentication credentials](#update-credentials) later in this article.

## Windows authentication

You can use Windows authentication in [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) through OAuth selection when configuring data refresh.

1. When connecting with Power BI Desktop, you'll be prompted to enter your credentials for the data source. Select Windows as shown here:

	![Windows authentication prompt](media/power-bi-windowsauth.png)

2. Enter your Windows credentials and choose <strong>Connect</strong>.

To change an existing URL to use Windows instead of a PAT, see [Change authentication credentials](#update-credentials) later in this article.

## Create a Personal Access Token  

1. Sign in to Azure DevOps Services, open your user profile menu, and select **Security**.  

	![User Profile, My Security menu option](../../media/open-security.png)  

1. Enter the required information: 
   - Add a description  
   - Set the expiration period  
   - Select the organization 
   - Choose Selected scopes
   - Check the **Analytics (read)**
	
     And, then choose **Create Token**.  

     > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
     > ![Create personal access token](media/client-authentication/personal-access-tokens-scoped-analytics-s139.png)  

2. Copy the token that displays. If you navigate away from the page, you can't retrieve it later.  

	![Copy Personal Access Token dialog](media/client-authentication/copy-personal-access-token.png)  

3. If you need to revoke a token, navigate to this page and choose the **Revoke** link. That token will immediately be denied access to Azure DevOps Services.
	
	These tokens are your identity. When used, the token is acting as you. Keep your tokens secret and treat them like your password. To help keep your token more secure, consider using credential managers. If you use credential managers, you won't have to enter your credentials every time you push.  

## Enter credentials within a client

Both Power BI and Excel work using Power Query when accessing OData. The authentication mechanism, including the various
authentication screens, are identical. This walkthrough is done using Power BI Desktop. It also applies to Excel.

1. Open <strong>Power BI Desktop</strong>.  

2. Choose <strong>Get Data</strong>.  

3. Select <strong>OData Feed</strong> (or <strong>More>Other>OData Feed</strong>).  

4. Enter the URL for the OData endpoint and choose <strong>OK</strong>.

	::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops"

    :::image type="content" source="media/authentication-6-onprem.png" alt-text="OData Feed URL":::

	::: moniker-end

5. In the authentication dialog, choose <strong>Basic</strong>, enter your credentials, and then choose <strong>Connect</strong>:  
   - If you're using an AAC, enter your username and password  
   - If you're using a PAT, enter a text string, such as "test" or "user" for the username and enter the token in the password field.

## Change authentication credentials

If you receive an access denied message, you may need to change your authentication credentials. Power Query caches your credential information so you only have to enter it once. However, Personal Access Tokens expire and you may need to update or change your authentication information. 

### Update credentials in Power BI Desktop

1. Open **Power BI Desktop**.  

2. Select **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Data Source Settings**. Select the correct URL to the OData Feed and select **Edit**.  

	::: moniker range="azure-devops"

	::: moniker-end

	::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops"

    :::image type="content" source="media/authentication-8-onprem.png" alt-text="Data source settings":::

	::: moniker-end

3. In the next **Data Source Settings** dialog, select the Edit button under the Credentials setting.   

	::: moniker range="azure-devops"

4. Edit the credentials as noted above, select **Save**, then **Done**, then **Close**. 

### Update credentials in Excel 

1. Open **Excel** and select the **Data** tab.  

2. Select **New Query** > **Data Source Settings...**

    :::image type="content" source="media/authentication-9-onprem.png" alt-text="Data source settings, next dialog.":::

	::: moniker-end

5. Edit the credentials as noted above, select **Save**, then **Done**, then **Close**.


## Publish to Power BI

After you've created a model and loaded it with data, you can [publish it to Power BI](publish-power-bi-desktop-to-power-bi.md). When using Azure AD or Windows, make sure to select
the **oAuth2** option.
