# Requirements tracking rollup sample report

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

This report builds on the [Requirements tracking report](sample-stories-overview.md) report and does a one level roll-up to provide aggregated metrics. For example, if you are tracking requirements with User Stories, you can have a one-level roll up (up to Features) with the queries provided in this section.

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]

An example is shown in the following image. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Stories Overview Rollup Report](media/odatapowerbi-storiesoverview-rollup.png)

> [!NOTE] 
> Requirement tracking is supported only for test cases linked through a [**Requirement-based test suite**](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md#backlog). The association between a requirement work item&mdash;User Story ([Agile](../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md)), Product Backlog Item ([Scrum](../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md)), Requirement ([CMMI](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md)), or Issue ([Basic](../../boards/get-started/plan-track-work.md))&mdash;and manual test execution is only formed when the test case is linked via a **Requirement-based test suite**.

## Sample queries

### Query area and iteration paths

In order to scope your report to a particular Area and Iteration path, you can query them as described in [Query your work tracking data using OData Analytics](../extend-analytics/wit-analytics.md#query-a-single-entity-set) and use AreaSK and IterationSK values of interest to supply to the other queries provided in the sections provided later in this article.

### Query for percentage of hours completion for requirements

> [!NOTE]   
> Change the `WorkItemType` based on the process you are using. The Scrum template supports **Feature** and the Basic template supports **Epic** as the roll up work item type, respectively.

## Power BI transforms

The transforms applied to Power BI queries are already added in query snippets.


## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The following example assumes that no one renamed any columns. 

To create the report, perform the following steps:

1. From the **Modeling** tab, choose **Manage Relationships** and link the three query results by WorkItemId column. 
1. Create a Power BI visualization **Table**.
1. Add the columns you are interested in from the three Power BI queries.
1. Select **Sum** as aggregation for additive columns like **Passed tests** etc.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI select Sum as aggregation](/azure/devops/report/powerbi/media/powerbi-sum-aggregation.png)

Here, **Authentication scenarios** is a parent feature of two User Stories.
