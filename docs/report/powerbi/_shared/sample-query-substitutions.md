Each query contains the following strings that you must substitute with your values. Do not include brackets {} with your substitution. For example if your organization name is "Fabrikam", replace {organization} with **Fabrikam**, not {Fabrikam}. 

- {organization} - Your organization name 
- {project} - Your team project name, or omit "/{project}" entirely, for a cross-project query
