# Data available from Analytics

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

The data available to you from Analytics depends on the Azure DevOps platform and version you're using and the Analytics version you query.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops-2022"

> [!NOTE]   
> For Azure DevOps Server, you can use Analytics in place of SQL Server Reporting Services or along side it. However, if you plan to use the Inheritance process model to customize work tracking, you can only use Analytics for reporting, the project collection must not be configured to support reporting. To learn more about the Inheritance process model, see [About process customization and inherited processes](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md).
