# Data available from the Analytics Service

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-azure-devops.md)]

The Analytics Service provides the reporting platform for Azure DevOps. The Analytics Service is generally available for Azure DevOps Service and in preview for Azure DevOps Server 2019. 


::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"

> [!NOTE]   
> For Azure DevOps Server 2019, you can use the Analytics Service in place of SQL Server Reporting Services or along side it. However, if you plan to use the Inheritance process model to customize work tracking, you can only use the Analytics Service for reporting, the project collection must not be configured to support reporting. To learn more about the Inheritance process model, see [About process customization and inherited processes](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model).

As more data types come online, we will update this page. Look for announcements on the [Microsoft DevOps Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/tag/reporting/).
