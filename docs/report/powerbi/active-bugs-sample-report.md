# Create an active bugs report in Power BI based on a custom Analytics view

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

In this article, we'll show you how to create a custom Analytics view for active bugs and then generate a Power BI report based on that view. You'll learn how to filter the Analytics view, create a trend chart, as well as a card showing the current count of active bugs. 

 Using Power BI connected to [Analytics views](../analytics/what-are-analytics-views.md), you can create reports on your work items. Reports can show your current work data and also historical revisions of the work items.  

Follow these steps to create a report in Power BI desktop that shows a **daily active trend of  bugs** based on a custom **Analytics view**:


1. From the web portal for VSTS   
	a. Open Analytics hub  
	b. Create a custom Analytics view for your data   
2. From the Power BI Desktop  
	a. Get the dataset defined by the Analytics view   
	b. Create a trend report  
	c. Apply filters to your trend report  
	d. Create a card and apply the Is Current=True filter to show current count

## Prerequisites  

In order to create a Power BI report that references an Analytics view, you must meet the following criteria:  

* You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one. See [Sign up for a free VSTS account](/vsts/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates). 
* If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](/vsts/accounts/add-account-users-assign-access-levels). Anyone with access to the team project, except stakeholders, can view Analytics views.
* Have installed the [Analytics Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-analytics). You must be an account owner or a member of the [Project Collection Administrator group](/vsts/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions) to add extensions.
* Have the **View Analytics** permission set to Allow. See [Grant permissions  to access the Analytics Service](/vsts/report/analytics/analytics-security).
- Have installed *Power BI Desktop* *February 2018 Update* or later version. You can download this client application from the official [Power BI Desktop download page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop).
- Have tracked bugs for some period of time on which to generate a trend report.

## Create a view to only include Active bugs

From the **Analytics** hub, choose ![plus icon](../_img/icons/blue-plus.png) **New View** to create a custom view. Fill out the forms provided in each tab as shown in the steps below. 

Choose **Continue** to move to the next tab in the panel. If you need to revisit a tab, simply click the tab title. 

### 1. Name your view and set to Private  

0. Give your view a name, such as Active bugs. Select **Private view** to save it under **My Views**. Otherwise, you can select **Shared view** to save it under **Shared Views**.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![General](_img/active-bugs-report/active-bugs-general.png)

	Choose **Continue** to move to the next tab. 

0. From the **Work items** tab, select the Project and Team that contain the data you want to report on.  
 
	Here we choose the FabrikamFiber team project and the Fiber Suite App team.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Filter by team](_img/active-bugs-report/active-bugs-team.png)

	To add additional projects or teams, click ![Add row icon](../_img/icons/add_row_icon.png) to add a new row and then select the team project and team. 

0. Under **Backlogs and work items**, click ![Add row icon](../_img/icons/add_row_icon.png) to add a new row, and then select **Bug** from the list of work items types.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Filter by "bug"](_img/active-bugs-report/wi-type-picker-bugs.png)

0. Under **Field criteria**, choose the **State** field set to **Active**.   

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    >![filter active bugs](_img/active-bugs-report/active-bugs-field-criteria.png)

	Choose **Continue** to move to the next tab. 

0. In the next tab, **Fields**, we'll keep the most common fields selection. This selection will also include any custom fields that have been added to your team project.  
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Fields](_img/active-bugs-report/fields-common.png)

	Choose **Continue** to move to the next tab. 

0. In the **History** tab, select **Rolling period in days** and enter **60** days. Keep the **Granularity** set to **Daily**. These selections will generate 60 snapshot rows of data for each active bug. Each day will include all the details of that work item as it was at the end of that day. 
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![60 days of history with Daily granularity](_img/active-bugs-report/active-bugs-history.png)

	To learn more about these defining trend data options, see [Create an Analytics view, Select trend data options](../analytics/analytics-views-create.md#select-trend-data).

	Choose **Continue** to move to the next tab. 

0. On the last tab, **Verification**, click **Verify view**. The system will verify your view by running a test query against the dataset it defines and validate all your filter criteria. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Verify the view](_img/active-bugs-report/active-bugs-verify.png)
    
    > [!NOTE]   
	> Verification time will vary based on the amount of data defined in your view. Verify your view to make sure all the definitions are correct.  

	Once your view successfully verifies, choose **Save**. You can then start using it in Power BI. Verification also returns an estimate of the number of rows in the dataset and the time it will take to load in Power BI.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![successful verification](_img/active-bugs-report/active-bugs-verify-success.png)

	If your view fails to verify successfully, you'll get an error explaining the issue and pointing to a possible fix. Try changing the options you selected in the **Work Items** and **History** tabs to include less data, and then verify the view again. 

## Open Power BI desktop and load your view 

0. Open Power BI Desktop.  
 
0. Choose (1) **Get Data**, choose (2) **Online Services**, then (3) **Visual Studio Team Services (Beta)**, and then click (4) **Connect**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Connect to VSTS data](_img/create-report/get-data-2.png)

0. Enter your account name, the same VSTS account you used to create the Active Bugs view,  and the same team project for which you defined the Active Bugs view. 

	![VSTS account and project name](_img/create-report/specify-account.png) 

0. Expand the **Private Views** folder, choose the **Active Bugs** view you saved in the previous section, and then click **Load**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Active bugs load in Power BI ](_img/active-bugs-report/choose-view.png)

	Need help connecting? See [Connect to VSTS with Power BI Data Connector](data-connector-connect.md).

## Create a daily bug trend report 

0. In your report, (1) select the Line chart visual, (2) enter `work item id` in the search field, and then (3) check the box for **Work Item Id**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select work item field](_img/create-report/select-line-chart-work-id.png)

	This will change your chart to a single dot.  

	> [!TIP]    
	> To change the chart size, choose the **View** tab, **Page View**, and then select the **Adjust Size** option as shown. You can then resize the chart to your desired dimensions.  
	> 
	> ![Adjust chart size](_img/active-bugs-report/adjust-view-size.png)  
     
0.	Click the context menu icon next to the **Work Item Id** field and change it from **Count** to **Count (Distinct)**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Select work item field](_img/active-bugs-report/choose-count-distinct.png)

0. Next, (1) select the **Date** field in the fields list as your axis. To see a daily trend, (2) click the context menu icon next to the field and change it from **Date Hierarchy** to **Date**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select Date, and change date hierarchy to date](_img/active-bugs-report/select-date.png)

   To view trends over time, you want to use **Date** and not **Date Hierarchy**. The **Date Hierarchy** in Power BI rolls ups everything into a simple number for the period. The day level in the hierarchy rolls all days to a number between 1-31. For example, April 3 and May 3 both roll up into number 3. This is not the same as counting items per actual date.

	> [!TIP]    
	> If you need to modify your Analytics view, you can do so and then return to your Power BI report and refresh the data. Simply click the **Refresh** option as shown.  
	> 
	> ![Refresh report data](_img/active-bugs-report/refresh-report-updated-view.png)

## Filter your trend by Priority

0. To group your bugs by `Priority`, search for the field in the list (a). Drag the Priority field into the `Legend` of your trend chart (b)

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Group by priority](_img/active-bugs-report/filter-priority-legend.png)

0. The chart now shows a daily distinct count of bugs, grouped by Priority.

0. To just show only Priority 0 and 1 bugs, click the context menu icon next to the **Priority** field to set the filters.  
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Filter top priority bugs](_img/active-bugs-report/filter-priority-1-and-2.png)

	The trend chart is now grouped and filtered by high priority bugs.

## Create a card for latest bug count

0. Add a new page by clicking the plus sign (+) at the bottom of the page. 

0. Select the card visual, add the **Work Item Id** field, add the **Work Item Type** field, and click the context menu icon next to the field and change it from **Count** to **Count (Distinct)**.

	The card now shows the number of active bugs times the number of days they existed within the selected time period.  For this example, that number is 1066. 
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Distinct count card, interim step](_img/active-bugs-report/card-active-bugs.png)
    
0. To get the latest count, add **Is Current** as a page level filter, and select the True checkbox. The **Is Current** field is added automatically to all datasets, marking the rows that contain the latest revision of the work items.
    
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Latest active bug count](_img/active-bugs-report/iscurrent.png)
   
	The value on this card should match the count on the last day of the trend chart, which you can obtain by returning to Page 1 and hovering over the last day as shown.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Check of latest active bug count against trend report](_img/active-bugs-report/check-of-is-current.png)

## Save your report, optionally share with others 

0. Choose **File > Save As** to save your report to your local workspace. 

0. To publish your report to Power BI, choose the **Publish** tab. For additional information, see [Collaborate in your Power BI app workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-collaborate-power-bi-workspace).

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Latest active bug count](_img/active-bugs-report/publish-powerbi.png)
