# Create an Analytics view in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

You can create a custom Analytics view to define the filtered set of data and other criteria to support your Power BI reporting needs. A custom view provides you with greater flexibility over filter criteria and the fields that get loaded into a Power BI report.

[!INCLUDE [analytics views warning](includes/analytics-views-warning.md)]

You can create custom views in the web portal for Azure DevOps. Then load the view using the [Power BI Data Connector](data-connector-connect.md). Like work item queries, you can create views only for your use, or share them with others on your team.

[!INCLUDE [disabled board note](../includes/boards-disabled.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-simple](../includes/analytics-prerequisites-simple.md)]

[!INCLUDE [open analytics to access views](../includes/analytics-open.md)]

## Browse your views

From the **All** page as shown in the following image, you can access all Analytics views defined for the project. **My Views** are views that only you can use or edit. **Shared Views** are views that are shared across the project. Anyone on your team can connect and use shared views in Power BI.

:::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/directory-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Analytics views page where you can see shared view." lightbox="media/editable-views/directory-actions.png":::

[!INCLUDE [differences per process](../includes/analytics-image-differences.md)]

To make a view into a favorite, hover over the view and choose the star icon: :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/icon-favorite-star.png":::. Your favorite views appear on the **Favorites** page.

## Create a custom view

To open a dialog to create a custom view, select :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/blue-plus.png"::: **New view**. Complete the forms provided in each tab to fully define the filter criteria for shaping the data you want to view in Power BI.

Complete the following steps to create a custom view.

1. [Name the view and choose a sharing option](#name-the-view-and-choose-a-sharing-option)
1. [Specify work item filters](#specify-wi-filters)
1. [Select the view's fields](#select-fields)
1. [Choose the amount of historical data contained within the view](#select-trend-data)
1. [Verify and save the view](#verify-and-save)

> [!NOTE]
> The board fields aren't available to add as filters or selection to view at this time. These fields include **Board Column**, **Board Column Done**, and **Board Lane**. A feature request is defined to add them, [Analytics view - Add Board Column to list of available Fields in Views](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/idea/467446/analytics-view-add-board-column-to-list-of-availab-1.html).

<a id="name-the-view-and-choose-a-sharing-option"></a>

### Name the view and choose a sharing option

Enter a name for the view and provide a description. To allow others to view and use the Analytics view, choose the **Shared** option. With shared views, you can set permissions as to who can view, edit, and delete the view as described in [Manage Analytics views](analytics-views-manage.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/general.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the New View General tab where you can specify the Shared View option." lightbox="media/editable-views/general.png":::

<a id="specify-wi-filters"></a>

### Specify work item filters

Specify filters to reduce the number of results returned by your view. In the work items section, you can add different filters on work item fields to scope your data. For a description of each available field, see [Metadata reference for Azure Boards Analytics](../analytics/entity-reference-boards.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/work-items-default.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the New View Work items tab where you can specify Work items filters." lightbox="media/editable-views/work-items-default.png":::

> [!TIP]
> Scope your data to generate reports that quickly refresh. For large datasets, refreshing non-filtered views can fail. To narrow your results, add the right set of filters. The more filters you add, the faster the view loads and refreshes in Power BI.

- **Add Teams or Area Path filters**

  By default, a view includes all the teams defined in the current project. You can specifically select teams in the current project or add other projects defined in the organization to the filter.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > We recommend a limit of 500 projects per Analytics view. If you need more than 500 projects, you can create additional Analytics views and distribute the projects between the views.

  You can change the selected teams for the current project or add other projects to the filter. You can also change from filtering on teams to area paths. Here's a view filtered by two Fabrikam area paths.

  :::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/area-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams or area paths dialog.":::

- **Add filters for backlogs and work items types**

  Scope the data to specific Work item types in your project. You can specify a backlog to filter by work item types associated with a specific backlog level or add individual specific work item types. Work items of the selected types are included in the view.

  :::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/wi-type-picker.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the backlogs and work items dropdown menu.":::

- **Add filters by field criteria**

  In addition to all previous filter criteria, you can add filters based on different work item fields. Specify these fields in the same way you do for fields you add to a work item query. As shown in the following example, you can filter to show only high Priority bugs with the specific "Hotfix" tag.

  :::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/field-criteria.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Backlogs and work items dialog where you can filter by Bugs, Priority, and Tags.":::

  For details about working with tags, see [Add work item tags to categorize and filter lists and boards](../../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > It's important to understand how filters apply to historical data. For more information, see [Historical data representation in Analytics](analytics-historical-filtering.md).

<a id="select-fields"></a>

### Select the fields that appear in the report

In the next tab, **Fields**, you can add and remove fields that you use in your report. Choose :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/blue-plus.png"::: **Add** to add a field. To start with a fresh list, choose **Remove All**.

:::image type="content" source="media/analytics-views/fields-customize-no-common.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the New View Fields tab where you can choose fields." lightbox="media/analytics-views/fields-customize-no-common.png":::

You can add any custom fields that you add through an inherited process.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't add fields with a data type of Plain Text (long text) or HTML (rich-text). These fields aren't available from Analytics for the purposes of reporting.

<a id="select-trend-data"></a>

### Select trend data options

In the next tab, **History**, choose the options that determine how much history data is available from the view.

In this example, if you have 10 work items and choose a rolling period of 14 days with a weekly granularity, your view contains 30 rows. If you refresh on Saturday, then you have a row on the last two Saturdays for each work item and a row for the most recent data on Saturday.

:::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/history-example.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the History tab, where you can select history and granularity options." lightbox="media/editable-views/history-example.png":::

#### History

For a snapshot of the current status, choose **Current only**. For trend charts, choose one of the other options as indicated.

|  Option  | Description |
|------|---------|
| **Current only** | Choose this option when you want a snapshot of work item status. Generates a single row per work item matching the work item's latest values in the Analytics data store. |
| **Rolling period** | Choose this option and enter the number of days previous to the current day to include in the dataset. The sliding window changes each time you refresh your report. |
| **Date range** | Choose this option and select a specific start and end date to include in the dataset, or select  **to present** to specify a rolling window with no fixed end date. When you select **to present**, the end date corresponds to the day the reports is refreshed. If you unselect it, the end date is always the date selected on the end date field. |
| **All history** | Choose this option to include the complete history for all work items you selected in your filter criteria. If you have a significant history, specify a **Weekly** or **Monthly** granularity.|

**Exclude work items that were completed before the start date** - Analytics stores all work item history, including any revisions for a closed work item. As a result, in an Analytics view, if you select a rolling period of 14 days, your view includes the current revision for all work items that were closed before this period.

To Exclude work items that were completed before a specific date, select the corresponding box under any of the options for history. It greatly reduces the amount of data loaded into Power BI and helps advanced calculations, like [time in state](create-timeinstate-report.md). For the **Rolling period** and **Date range**, the date to exclude work items gets set by the start of the period. For **Current only** and **All history**, you need to provide that date. For example, the following image excludes all work times that were completed before August 24, 2024.

:::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/history-exclude.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the History tab where you can exclude work items for a rolling period of 14 days." lightbox="media/editable-views/history-exclude.png":::

#### Granularity

You can choose to get a snapshot of every work item for each day, week, or month. Each row represents the item based on the most recent revision for the defined interval.

|  Option  | Description |
|------|---------|
| **Daily** | Generates a row per work item showing the latest data for each day. |
| **Weekly** | Generates a row per work item showing the data per week taken on the day that represents the week. The value defaults to Saturday. |
| **Monthly** | Generates a row per work item showing the data for the last day of each month. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Preview rows is a calculated value based on history and granularity and might not match with Power BI.
> - It is important to understand how filters are applied to historical data. For more information, see [Historical data representation in Analytics](analytics-historical-filtering.md).

### Verify and save the view

The last step verifies your view by running a test query against the view and validating the filter criteria. Verification time can vary according to the amount of data defined in your view. For example, a view that includes all work item types and specifies **All history** takes more time to verify than a view that includes only bugs and specifies a rolling period of 30 days.

> [!TIP]  
> Verifying your view is an important step. When verification ends successfully, your view is more likely to load correctly in Power BI. If verification takes too long, you can adjust the view. Add filters or narrow your history and verify your view again.

After your view successfully verifies, save it. You can then start using it in Power BI.

If a view fails to verify successfully, you get an error explaining the issue and pointing to a possible fix. Try changing the definitions and verify the view again. When the view verifies successfully, you get an estimate of the row count included in your view.

:::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/verify-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the successful verification message, which includes an estimate of your row count." lightbox="media/editable-views/verify-success.png":::

For example, if you try to filter by a field that is no longer defined for the project, you get an error. You can remove that field from the filters in the [Work Items filters](#specify-wi-filters) tab and verify again.

For more information about resolving errors, see [Resolve errors associated with an Analytics view](troubleshooting-views.md).

## Review a view's filter criteria

In **Analytics views**, choose any view from the **Favorites** or **All** page to see a summary of the view's definitions and filters. Choose **Edit** to edit a view.

:::image type="content" source="media/editable-views/summary-panel.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the summary panel of the view's definitions and filters.":::
