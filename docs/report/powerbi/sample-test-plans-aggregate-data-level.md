# Manual test suites aggregated view sample report

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)] 

Some scenarios have a hierarchical organization of test suites as per organization departments or modules as shown below. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Test Plan structure for aggregated view](media/odatapowerbi-aggregatedatlevel-plan.png)

As shown in the above image, there are level 3 test suites with same names under different level 2 test suites. In that case, an aggregation at a particular test suite level may be required. This article explains how to do it for all level 3 test suites in a test plan.

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]

For a sample test suite hierarchy in a test plan like below, you can configure this report.

> ![Sample - Test Suites Aggregated View - Report](media/odatapowerbi-aggregatedatlevel.png)

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-required-reading.md)]

[!INCLUDE [temp](./includes/prerequisites-power-bi-2020.md)]

For the report to generate useful data, the team must carry out the following activities to manage test plans:

- Define test plans, test suites, and test cases. Specify their state. For a Test Suite to run, it must be in the In Progress state. For a Test Case to run, it must be in the Ready state. For details, see [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md) and [Create manual test cases](../../test/create-test-cases.md). 
- Run manual tests and verify the results. Mark the results of each validation step in the test case as passed or failed. For details, see [Run manual tests](../../test/run-manual-tests.md).

	> [!NOTE]  
	> Testers must mark a test step with a status if it is a validation test step. The overall result for a test reflects the status of all the test steps that were marked. Therefore, the test will have a status of failed if any test step is marked as failed or not marked.

### Substitution strings

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-query-substitutions-3.md)]

### Query breakdown

The following table describes each part of the query.


:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Query part**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Description**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle}' and TestSuite/IdLevel3 ne null))`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Return data for only selected test plan. Also return the data for level 3 test suites onwards. You can add multiple plans with a clause like `filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle1}' or TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle2}' and TestSuite/IdLevel3 ne null))`. You can also apply any other filters related to test suites, test configurations here.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/groupby((TestSuite/TitleLevel3),`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   The test suites to group by. If you're interested in getting report for all distinct test suites lying at level 3 of test suite hierarchy, you can specify this query part. You can change the level number from 1-14. If you wish to separate test suites with same name, you can use  `/groupby((TestSuite/TitleLevel3, TestSuite/IdLevel3),` to sure that even if you have two test suites with same name, they'll be shown as two different entries as they would have two different IDs.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/aggregate($count as TotalCount,`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Aggregate data across the filtered test points with having count as `TotalCount`.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `cast(LastResultOutcome eq 'Passed', Edm.Int32) with sum as Passed,`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   While aggregating, type-cast test points having latest execution outcome 'Passed' to 1 and sum them up as '`Passed`' metric.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/compute(Executed mul 100 div TotalCount as ExecPct`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Provide a computed metric ExecPct that is equal to (Executed test points / Total count * 100).
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Power BI transforms

In Power BI, do the following steps.  

When finished, you may choose to rename columns. 

1. Expand `TestSuite`
    - Choose the expand button.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	    > ![Power BI Expand Test Suite](media/powerbi-expand-testsuite.png)

    - Select the fields to flatten.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	    > ![Power BI select fields to flatten](media/powerbi-test-suite-flatten.png)

    - The table now contains entity field of `TestSuite.IdLevel3` and `TestSuite.TitleLevel3`.

        > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	    > ![Power BI expanded test suite](media/powerbi-expanded-testsuite.png)

1. Right-click a column header and select **Rename...**

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Columns](media/powerbi-rename-columns.png)

1. Change the type of count columns to **Whole Number** and percentage fields to **Decimal Number**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Power BI Change Column Type](media/powerbi-change-column-type.png)

1. You also may want to rename the query from the default **Query1**, to something more meaningful. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Query](media/powerbi-rename-query.png)

1. Once done, choose **Close & Apply** to save the query and return to Power BI.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Close & Apply](media/powerbi-close-apply.png)


## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The example below assumes that no one renamed any columns. 

To create the report, do the following steps:

1. Create a Power BI visualization **Table**.
1. Add the columns **TestSuite.TitleLevel3, NotRunCount, RunCount, PassedCount, TotalCount**.
1. Select **Sum** as aggregation for **Count**.
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI select Sum as aggregation](media/powerbi-sum-aggregation.png)

Your report should look similar to the following image.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Test Suites Aggregated View - Report](media/odatapowerbi-aggregatedatlevel.png)
