# Pipeline duration sample report 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

This article shows you how to get pipeline duration, or the time taken to run a pipeline. This report is similar to the duration summary metric in the 'Pipeline duration' chart of the [Pipeline duration report](../../pipelines/reports/pipelinereport.md#pipeline-duration-report). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]

An example of the pipeline duration report is shown in the following image.

## Power BI transforms

### Change column type

The query doesn't return all the columns in the format in which you can directly consume them in Power BI reports.

1. Change the type of columns **Duration50thPercentileInSeconds, Duration80thPercentileInSeconds** and **Duration95thPercentileInSeconds** to **Decimal Number**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI + OData - change column type](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/duration-changecolumntype1.png)


### Rename fields and query 

When finished, you may choose to rename columns. 

1. Right-click a column header and select **Rename...**

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Columns](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/duration-renamerightclick.png)
  
1. You also may want to rename the query from the default **Query1**, to something more meaningful. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Query](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/renamequery.png)
  
1. Once done, choose **Close & Apply** to save the query and return to Power BI.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Close & Apply](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/closeandapply.png)
  
  
## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The example below assumes that no one renamed any columns. 
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Pipelines Duration - Fields](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/duration-fields.png)

For a simple report, do the following steps:

1. Select Power BI Visualization **Clustered Column chart**.

1. Add the field "Duration50thPercentileInSeconds" to **Fields**.

1. Add the field "Duration80thPercentileInSeconds" to **Fields**.

1. Add the field "Duration95thPercentileInSeconds" to **Fields**.


Your report should appear similar to the following image.   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Pipelines Duration - Report](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/duration-report.png)


## More queries

You can use the following other queries to create different but similar reports using the same steps defined previously in this article.


### Use Pipeline ID, rather than Pipeline Name

You can change your Pipeline name. To ensure that the Power BI reports don't break when the pipeline name is changed, use pipeline ID rather than pipeline name. You can obtain the pipeline ID  from the URL of the pipeline runs page.

`https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_build?definitionId= **{pipelineid}**`

### Filter by branch

You may want to view the duration of a pipeline for a particular **branch** only. To create the report, carry out the following extra steps along with those steps defined previously in this article.

- Expand Branch into Branch.BranchName.  
- Add the field **Branch.BranchName** to **Axis**.

                &"Pipeline/PipelineName eq '{pipelinename}' "

            &"/groupby( "
                &"(Duration50thPercentileInSeconds, Duration80thPercentileInSeconds,Duration95thPercentileInSeconds, Branch/BranchName)) "

### Duration for all project pipelines

You may want to view the duration for all the pipelines of the project in a single report. To create the report, follow the below extra steps along with what is defined previously in this article.

- Expand Pipeline into  Pipeline.PipelineName.
- Add the field **PIpeline.PipelineName** to **Axis**.

Refer [Outcome summary for all pipelines](sample-pipelines-allpipelines.md) sample report that has detailed similar steps as required here.
