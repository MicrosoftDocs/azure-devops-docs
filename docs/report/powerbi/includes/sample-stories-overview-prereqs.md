## Prerequisites

For the report to generate useful data, you need to have performed the following tasks: 

- You have define requirement work items and assigned them to the area and iteration paths of interest. For information about how to define area and iteration paths, see [Define area paths](../../../organizations/settings/set-area-paths.md) and [Define iteration paths](../../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md).
- To get the percentage of hours completion, you need to fill in the [Complete Work](../../../boards/queries/query-numeric.md#completed-work) and [Remaining Work](../../../boards/queries/query-numeric.md#remaining-work) fields of tasks or bugs linked to requirements with the **Child** link type. 
- To get the execution status of test cases, you will have created *requirement-based test suites* in Test Plans corresponding to those requirements. Inline tests you add through the Kanban board satisfy this prerequisite, however requirements that you link to tests don't. To learn more, see [Create test plans and test suites](../../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).
- To get the status of bugs, you will have created and linked bugs to requirements with the **Child** link type.
