## Manage permissions for a shared view

All members of the Contributors group for your project can use **Shared** views in Power BI. For shared views that you create, you can manage the permissions of users and groups to create, delete, or view a specific shared view.

1. To change the permissions for a shared view, open **Analytics views**, and choose **All**. For details, see [Create an Analytics view](../analytics-views-create.md). 

1. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="/azure/devops/report/media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon and then select **Security**.

2. Change the permissions so that the team member or group can't edit or delete the view.

3. Add a user or group who you want to grant permissions to or restrict access.
