> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Analytics views only support Azure Boards data (work items)**. Analytics views don't support other data types, such as pipelines. Views provide a flat list of work items and don't support work item hierarchies. At this point, there are no plans to update the connector to support other types of data. For information on other approaches, see [About Power BI integration](../overview.md).
