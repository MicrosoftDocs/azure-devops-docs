If it is disabled, **Analytics views** won't be displayed. To re-enable a service, see [Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off](../../../organizations/settings/set-services.md)
- To use **Analytics views**, [enable the Analytics Views preview feature](../../../project/navigation/preview-features.md) either for individual users or for the organization. 
- Also, you must have your ***View Analytics**  permission set to *Allow*. For more information, see [Grant permissions to access the Analytics service](../analytics-security.md).
- To use Power BI for Azure DevOps or to exercise an OData query for Analytics, you must must have your **View Analytics** permission set to *Allow*. By default, all Contributors with Basic access are granted access. To edit shared **Analytics views**, you must have your **Edit shared Analytics views** permission set to *Allow*. For more information, see [Grant permissions to access the Analytics service](../analytics-security.md).
