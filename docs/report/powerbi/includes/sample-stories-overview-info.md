## Questions the report answers

Requirements tracking reports are useful for answering the following types of questions.

**Work progress**
- *Does the amount of work that remains for each requirement correspond to your expectations?*
- *Are top-ranked requirements being implemented first?*
- *How many tests are defined for each requirement? How many tests are passing?*
- *What requirements are being implemented that have no test cases defined for them?*

**Quality progress**
- *How many test cases have run for each requirement, and how many have passed?*
- *How many active bugs does each requirement have?*
- *Are bugs being found for requirements that are being tested?*
- *Are bugs being resolved or are they remaining active?*

**Risk assessment**
- *Which requirements are at risk?*
- *Which requirements aren't sufficiently stable for release?*
- *Which requirements can we ship today?*
