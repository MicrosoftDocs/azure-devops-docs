# Manual test execution trend sample report

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)] 

This article shows you how to get the execution state of one or more Test Plans in Power BI. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]
 
The report generated is similar to following image and the Outcome trend chart of the [Progress report](../../test/progress-report.md).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Execution Trend - Report](media/odatapowerbi-executiontrend.png)

The report displays a trend chart that summarizes the number and outcome states of Test Plans executed over a specified period of time.  

- **Passed**: Number of test cases passing.  
- **Failed**: Number of test cases failing.  
- **NotApplicable**: Number of test cases 
- **Blocked**:  Number of test cases blocked from running.  
- **NotExecuted**: Number of test cases defined but not executed.  

## Questions the report answers

This report helps you track the team's progress with respect to planned testing of your product or service by answering the following questions:

- *How much testing is complete?*
- *What is the current status of tests passing, failing, or being blocked?*
- *How many tests are passing and what does the trend indicate about software quality?*
- *How many tests are failing?*
- *How many tests are blocked and what does the trend indicate?*

A healthy test execution trend report shows a steady progress in test plans running and passing. Ideally, the report shows a relatively flat number of test cases for a given plan. As the development cycle progresses, the number of passing test cases should increase, and the numbers of test cases in other states should go down.

[!INCLUDE [temp](./includes/prerequisites-power-bi-2020.md)]

For the report to generate useful data, the team must carry out the following activities to manage test plans:

- Define test plans, test suites, and test cases. Specify their state. For a Test Suite to run, it must be in the In Progress state. For a Test Case to run, it must be in the Ready state. For details, see [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md) and [Create manual test cases](../../test/create-test-cases.md). 
- Run manual tests and verify the results. Mark the results of each validation step in the test case as passed or failed. For details, see [Run manual tests](../../test/run-manual-tests.md).

	> [!NOTE]  
	> Testers must mark a test step with a status if it is a validation test step. The overall result for a test reflects the status of all the test steps that were marked. Therefore, the test will have a status of failed if any test step is marked as failed or not marked.   


## Sample queries

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-powerbi-query.md)]

```
let 
    Source = OData.Feed ("https://analytics.dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_odata/v3.0-preview/TestPointHistorySnapshot?" 
        &"$apply=filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle}') and (DateSK ge {startDate} and DateSK le {endDate}))" 
        &"/groupby("

### Substitution strings


Each query contains the following strings that you must replace with your values. Don't include brackets {} with your substitution. For example if your organization name is "Fabrikam", replace `{organization}` with **Fabrikam**, not `{Fabrikam}`. 

- `{organization}` - Your organization name 
- `{project}` - Your team project name, or omit "/{project}" entirely, for a cross-project query
- `{testPlanTitle}` - Title of your test plan. Example: `Fabrikam test plan`.
- `{startDate}` and `{endDate}` - Date range of interest. You can enter the dates in YYYYMMDD format. For example, `20190822` for 22 August 2019.


### Query breakdown

The following table describes each part of the query.

---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      **Query part**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      **Description**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle}'))`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Return data for only selected test plan. You can add multiple plans with a clause like `filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle1}'` or `TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle2}'))`. You can also apply any other filters related to test suites, test configurations here.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `and (DateSK ge {startDate} and DateSK le {endDate})`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Date range of interest. You can enter the dates in **YYYYMMDD** format. 
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `/groupby((DateSK)`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Group the data into bins of same date. It produces one set of values per day in given date range.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `/aggregate($count as TotalCount,`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      Aggregate data across the filtered test points with having count as `TotalCount`. 
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `cast(LastResultOutcome eq 'Passed', Edm.Int32) with sum as Passed,`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      While aggregating, type-cast test points having latest execution outcome 'Passed' to 1 and sum them up as `Passed` metric.

## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The example below assumes that no one renamed any columns. 


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Execution Trend - Fields](media/odatapowerbi-executiontrend-fields.png)

To create the report, do the following steps:

1. Create a Power BI visualization **Stacked Area Chart**.
1. Drag and drop **DateSK** in **Axis**.
1. Drag and drop **Passed**, **Failed**, **Blocked**, **NotApplicable** and **NotExecuted** in **Values**.

Your report should look similar to the following image.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Execution Trend - Report](media/odatapowerbi-executiontrend.png)
