# Publish a Power BI Desktop file to PowerBI.com 

**VSTS**  

Once you've [created a Power BI Desktop file](access-analytics-power-bi.md) and the associated datasets, measures and charts, you can share those with others by creating a dashboard on PowerBI.com. This process walks you through how to do that. 

1. Verify that the [Analytics View](../analytics/what-are-analytics-views.md) is shared with all users who might have [access to edit it](../analytics/analytics-views-create.md).

0. Open the **Power BI Desktop** file with your data.  

0. Click **Publish** on the **Home** tab.

0. You will be prompted to Sign in, if you don't already have a Power BI account you will need to create one. Click **Sign in**.

	See [Client Authentication Options](../analytics/client-authentication-options.md) for more information on acquiring credentials.  
>[!IMPORTANT]  
>If you are using a Personal Access Token, remember that the token expires on a set interval. When it expires you'll need to [update the credentials](../analytics/client-authentication-options.md#update-credentials). Otherwise the report, while still displaying data, won't update with the latest data.

0. Click **Sign in**.  

At this point, the data will update on your scheduled basis using the credentials entered.
