# Requirements tracking sample report

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-azure-devops.md)]

This article provides instructions on how to track the quality of work items that belong to the Requirements category. This includes work items such as User Stories (Agile), Product Backlog Items (Scrum) and Requirements (CMMI). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]

An example is shown in the following image. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Stories Overview Report](media/odatapowerbi-storiesoverview.png) 
 

> [!NOTE] 
> Requirement tracking is supported only for test cases linked through a [**Requirement-based test suite**](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md#backlog). The association between a requirement work item&mdash;User Story ([Agile](../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md)), Product Backlog Item ([Scrum](../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md)), Requirement ([CMMI](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md)), or Issue ([Basic](../../boards/get-started/plan-track-work.md)) and manual test execution is only formed when the test case is linked via a **Requirement-based test suite**.

## Sample queries

### Query area and iteration paths

In order to scope your report to a particular Area and Iteration path, you can query them as described in [Query your work tracking data using OData Analytics](../extend-analytics/wit-analytics.md#query-a-single-entity-set) and use AreaSK and IterationSK values of interest to supply to the other queries provided in the sections provided later in this article.

### Query for percentage of hours completion for requirements

> [!NOTE]   
> The following query works for the Agile process since it defines `Remaining Work` and `Completed Work` fields in work items.

## Power BI transforms

The transforms applied to Power BI queries are already added in query snippets.


## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The following example assumes that no one renamed any columns. 

To create the report, perform the following steps:

1. From the **Modeling** tab, choose **Manage Relationships** and link the three query results by WorkItemId column. 
1. Create a Power BI visualization **Table**.
1. Add the columns you are interested in from the three Power BI queries.
1. Select **Sum** as aggregation for additive columns like **Passed tests** etc.
    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI select Sum as aggregation](/azure/devops/report/powerbi/media/powerbi-sum-aggregation.png)

Your report should look similar to the following image.
