# Pipeline outcome summary sample report 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)] 

This article shows you how to get the number of runs for different pipeline outcomes (Succeeded / Failed / Canceled / Partially Succeeded). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]

An example is shown in the following image.

## Power BI transforms

### Change column type

1. Change the type of column TotalCount to **Whole Number**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
    > ![Power BI + OData - change column type](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/outcomesummary-changecolumntype.png)

### Rename fields and query, then Close & Apply

When finished, you may choose to rename columns. 

1. Right-click a column header and select **Rename...**

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Columns](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/outcomesummary-renamerightclick.png)

1. You also may want to rename the query from the default **Query1**, to something more meaningful. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Rename Query](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/renamequery.png)

1. Once done, choose **Close & Apply** to save the query and return to Power BI.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
	> ![Power BI Close & Apply](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/closeandapply.png)
  
  
## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The example below assumes that no one renamed any columns. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Pipelines Outcome Summary - Fields](media/odatapowerbi-pipelines/outcomesummary-fields.png)

For a simple report, do the following steps:

1. Select Power BI Visualization **Donut Chart**. 
1. Add the field "SucceededCount" to **Values**.
    - Right-click "SucceededCount" field and ensure **Sum** is selected.
1. Add the field "FailedCount" to **Values**.
	  - Right-click "FailedCount" field and ensure **Sum** is selected.
1. Add the field "CanceledCount" to **Values**.
	  - Right-click "CanceledCount" field and ensure **Sum** is selected.
1. Add the field "PartiallySucceededCount " to **Values**.
    - Right-click "PartiallySucceededCount " field and ensure **Sum** is selected.
    
Your report should look like this.

## More queries

You can use the following other queries to create different but similar reports using the same steps defined previously in this article.

### Use Pipeline ID, rather than Pipeline Name

You can change your Pipeline name. To ensure that the Power BI reports don't break when a pipeline name is changed, use the pipeline ID rather than its name. You can obtain the pipeline ID  from the URL of the pipeline runs page.

`https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_build?definitionId= **{pipelineid}**`

### Filter by branch

You may want to view the outcome summary of a pipeline for a particular **branch**. To create the report, carry out the following extra steps along with what is defined previously in this article.

- Expand Branch into Branch.BranchName
- Select Power BI Visualization **Slicer** and add the field Branch.BranchName to the slicer's **Field**
- Select the pipeline from the slicer for which you need to see the outcome summary
