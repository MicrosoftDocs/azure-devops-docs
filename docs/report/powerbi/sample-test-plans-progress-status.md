# Progress status sample report 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)] 

This article shows you how to get the execution state of one or more Test Plans in Power BI. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/preview-note.md)]

The report generated is similar to following image and the Summary chart of the [Track test status - Progress report](../../test/track-test-status.md).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Overall Execution State - Report](media/odatapowerbi-overallexecution.png)

This report displays two donut charts that summarize Test Plans executed and not executed, and the status of executed Test Plans.  

- **Executed vs Not executed** 
	- **Executed**: The percentage of test plans defined which have run.  
	- **NotExecuted**: The percentage of test plans defined which haven't run.    
- **Split by outcome** 
	- **Blocked**:  Percentage of test cases that are currently blocked from running.  
	- **Failed**: Percentage of test cases that failed.  
	- **NotApplicable**: Percentage of test cases that didn't run.  
	- **Passed**: Percentage of test cases that passed.  
 

## Questions the report answers

The overall execution state report helps you track the team's progress with respect to planned testing of your product or service by answering the following questions:

- *How much testing is complete?*
- *What is the current status of tests passing, failing, or being blocked?*

[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/sample-required-reading.md)]

[!INCLUDE [temp](./includes/prerequisites-power-bi-2020.md)]

For the report to generate useful data, the team must carry out the following activities to manage test plans:

- Define test plans, test suites, and test cases. Specify their state. For a Test Suite to run, it must be in the In Progress state. For a Test Case to run, it must be in the Ready state. For details, see [Create manual test cases](../../test/create-test-cases.md). 
- Run manual tests and verify the results. Mark the results of each validation step in the test case as passed or failed. For details, see [Run manual tests](../../test/run-manual-tests.md).

	> [!NOTE]  
	> Testers must mark a test step with a status if it is a validation test step. The overall result for a test reflects the status of all the test steps that were marked. Therefore, the test will have a status of failed if any test step is marked as failed or not marked.

### Query breakdown

The following table describes each part of the query.


:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Query part**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Description**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle}')) `
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Return data for only selected test plan. You can add multiple plans with a clause like `filter((TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle1}' or TestSuite/TestPlanTitle eq '{testPlanTitle2}'))`. You can also apply any other filters related to test suites, test configurations here.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/aggregate($count as TotalCount,`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Aggregate data across the filtered test points with having count as `TotalCount`.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `cast(LastResultOutcome eq 'Passed', Edm.Int32) with sum as Passed`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   While aggregating, type-cast test points having latest execution outcome 'Passed' to 1 and sum them up as '`Passed`' metric.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/compute(Executed mul 100 div TotalCount as ExecPct`.
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Provide a computed metric `ExecPct` that is equal to (Executed test points / Total count * 100).

## Create the report

Power BI shows you the fields you can report on. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The example below assumes that no one renamed any columns. 


> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Overall Execution - Fields](media/odatapowerbi-overallexecution-fields.png)

To create the report, do the following steps:

1. To create donut chart of Executed v/s Not executed:
    - Create a Power BI visualization **Donut chart**.
    - Drag and drop **Executed** and **NotExecuted** in **Values**.
2. To create donut chart of split by outcome
    - Create a Power BI visualization **Donut chart**.
    - Drag and drop outcome values like **Passed**, **Failed**, **Blocked**, **NotApplicable**, and so on, into **Values**.

Your report should appear similar to the following image. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sample - Overall Execution State - Report](media/odatapowerbi-overallexecution.png)
