# Power BI Integration

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-azure-devops.md)]  

With Azure DevOps, you can create [dashboards](../dashboards/dashboards.md) and [add widgets to them](../dashboards/add-widget-to-dashboard.md). Azure DevOps also provides several reports in the product itself. Both dashboards and in-line reports offer easy access to [Azure DevOps Analytics](what-is-analytics.md) to enable data-driven decisions. However, we acknowledge that customers often need more than what is provided in the product. 

With Power BI, you can pull data from [Azure DevOps Analytics](what-is-analytics.md), generate reports, and customize them to meet your needs. To learn more, read our [Power BI Integration Overview](overview.md)
