# Metadata reference for Azure Boards Analytics 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

The Analytics service collects all work tracking activity defined and updated through Azure Boards.  Analytics stores as properties all work tracking fields, except for HTML/rich-text and History fields. Custom properties for custom fields are automatically added to  Analytics. 

This article describes the majority of properties that you can use to generate an Analytics report for work tracking. You use a combination of properties to filter a query, aggregate data, or build a report. You can run these queries directly in your browser. To learn more, see [Query your work tracking data using OData Analytics](../extend-analytics/wit-analytics.md). If you're new to work tracking and Azure Boards, we recommend you review the following articles: 
- [What is Azure Boards?](../../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md)
- [Track user stories, issues, bugs, and other work items in Azure Boards](../../boards/work-items/about-work-items.md)   


[!INCLUDE [note-analytics-early-draft](../includes/note-analytics-data-model.md)]

## Overview of entity sets

When querying Analytics for work tracking data, use one of the following entity types or entity sets. 
- Query `WorkItems` to generate status and rollup reports 
- Query `WorkItemSnapshot` to generate trend, burndown, and burnup reports 

Use other entity types, such as `Area`, `Iteration`, `Project`, `Team`, or other entities to filter data or select properties to report on. For a summary of example reports, see [Sample reports and quick reference index](../extend-analytics/quick-ref.md).
 
> [!NOTE]  
> To generate status and trend reports on test-specific work item types, query the `WorkItems` and `WorkItemSnapshot` entity types and filter based on the work item type. For information on test runs, test results, or other test data, query the `TestRuns`, `TestPoints`, `TestResultsDaily`, `TestSuite` or `TestPointHistorySnapshot` entity types. To learn more, see [Test metadata reference for Azure DevOps](entity-reference-test-plans.md).

|EntityType  | EntitySet  | Description |

### About snapshots 

There are two work tracking snapshot entity sets: `WorkItemSnapshot` and `WorkItemBoardSnapshot`.

A snapshot provides a record of the values defined for a work item each day. The record is written to the Analytics service once a day at the same time each day. You use snapshots when you want to generate a trend report.  By default, all the snapshot tables are modeled as daily snapshot fact tables. If you query for a time range it will get a value for each day. Long time ranges result in a large number of records. If you don't need such high precision, you can use weekly or even monthly snapshots.

To learn more, see [OData query guidelines, Do use weekly or monthly snapshots for trend queries that span a long time period](../extend-analytics/odata-query-guidelines.md#-do-use-weekly-or-monthly-snapshots-for-trend-queries-that-span-a-long-time-period). 


### About work item revisions

 Each time you update a work item, the system creates a new revision and records this action in the `System.RevisedDate` field, which makes it useful for specifying a history filter. The revised date is represented by `RevisedDate` (DateTime) and `RevisedDateSK` (Int32) properties. For best performance, use the latter date surrogate key. It represents the date when a revision was created or it has null for active or incomplete revisions. If you want all the dates since the `{startDate}` inclusive, add the following filter to your query.

`RevisedDateSK eq null or RevisedDateSK gt {startDateSK}`  

You use the `WorkItemRevisions` entity set to load all the revisions for a given work item. The query returns all historic work item revisions, including the current revision, for the work items you filter on. It doesn't include deleted work items.

## Shared properties across several entity types 

The properties you can select in an **Analytics view** correspond to regular work tracking fields and select Analytics properties, such as **Cycle Time Days** and **Lead Time Days**. These properties, most of which are listed and described in the following table, are defined for the following entity types, unless otherwise specified. 

- `WorkItem`  
- `WorkItemRevision`  
- `WorkItemSnapshot`  
- `WorkItemBoardSnapshot`  
 
> [!NOTE]  
> The Analytics service doesn't store any data for long text fields assigned the HTML or rich text data type. This includes **Description** and **History** fields. Analytics doesn't store link or attached file counts either. For a complete list of fields that are defined in the default process templates, see [Work item field index](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md). For descriptions of each data type, see [Query fields, operators, and macros](../../boards/queries/query-operators-variables.md).  
> Not all properties associated with Scrum and CMMI process-specific fields are included in the following table. For a list of these fields, see [Field descriptions for default and work item fields used in process templates, Fields used to track CMMI work items](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md#fields-used-to-track-cmmi-work-items).

Many properties are date-based or user-based. These properties are associated with the **CalendarDate** and **User** entity sets described in [Calendar date, Project, and User metadata reference](entity-reference-general.md).

## About data types and data models 
 

## Customizing a process

You can add fields, work item types, and change the menu selection of a pick list. The Analytics service automatically picks up changes made and updates the metadata for the data model. 

To perform any of the following tasks, see the relevant article. 

- To change the menu selection, see [Add and manage fields  (Inherited process)]() or [Add or modify a field, customize a picklist] (On-premises XML process).
 
- Note about how some fields are defined in one process, but can be added to other work item types in other processes. 
 
> [!NOTE]
> Changes to custom work item fields will affect the shape of your data model and will affect all work item revisions. For instance, if you add a new field, queries on pre-existing revision data will reflect the presence of the new field.
