[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)] 

The entity types and entity sets listed in the following table can be used to filter and build reports based on Analytics data.

> |EntityType|  EntitySet | Description |  
> |----------------------|-------------|-------------|  
> |[**CalendarDate**](#calendar-date-properties)|  **Dates** | The dates used to filter and group other entities using relationships.  |  
> |[**Project**](#project-properties)|  **Projects** |Projects defined for an organization (cloud) or project collection (on-premises). |  
> |[**User**](#user-properties)|  **Users** |User information that is used to expand or filter various work item properties, for example **Assigned To**, **Created By**. |

## Calendar date properties 

The following properties are valid for the **CalendarDate** entity type. The surrogate key associated with **CalendarDate** is `DateSK`. You can specify calendar date properties to filter and structure reports.  


|**Display name** | **Name**           | **Data type** | **Description** | 
|-----------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
|  | `IsLastDayOfPeriod` | Enumerated | Use to filter data to determine if a day finishes in different periods such as days, weeks, months, or years.  Valid values are listed below for [Period](#period-enumerated-type-members).|
|**Date**         | `Date` | DateTime | A specific calendar date.  | 
|**Day Name**     | `DayName` | String | The name of a day, such as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on.   |
|**Day Short Name** | `DayShortName` | String | The short name assigned to a day, such as Mon, Tue, Wed, and so on.  | 
|**Day Of Week**  | `DayOfWeek` | Int32 | The number associated with the day within a week.  | 
|**Day Of Month** | `DayOfMonth` | Int32 | The number associated with the day within a month.  |  
|**Day Of Year**  | `DayOfYear` | Int32 | The number associated with the day of a year.   |  
|**Week Starting Date** | `WeekStartingDate` | DateTime | The date associated with the start of a week.    |  
|**Week Ending Date**   | `WeekEndingDate` | DateTime | The date associated with the end of a week.     |  
|**Month**        | `Month` | String | The abbreviated name of a month and year, for example, Jan 2022, Feb 2022, Mar 2022, and so on. |  
|**Month Name**   | `MonthName` | String | The name of a month, such as January, February, March, and so on.  |  
|**Month Short Name** | `MonthShortName` | String | The abbreviated name of a month, such as Jan, Feb, Mar, and so on.    |  
|**Month Of Year** | `MonthOfYear` | Int32 | The number assigned to a month. For example 1, 2, and 3 corresponding to January, February, and March.  |  
|**YearMonth**    | `YearMonth` | Int32 | A number corresponding to the concatenated year and month. For example, 202201, 202202, and 202203 corresponds to January, February, and March of 2022.    |  
|**Year**  | `Year` | Int32 | The year, such as 2019, 2020, 2021 and so on.  |  

By default, all the snapshot tables are modeled as *daily snapshot fact* tables. If you query for a time range it will get a value for each day. Long time ranges result in a large number of records. If you don't need such high precision, you can use weekly or even monthly snapshots. 

When you aggregate data for a snapshot entity, you should include the `DateSK` or a `DateValue` column in a `groupby` clause as described in the [OData query guidelines](../extend-analytics/odata-query-guidelines.md#restrict-aggregate-snapshot). For example reports that specify a date filter, see the following articles: 
 
- [Query trend data](../extend-analytics/querying-for-trend-data.md)
- [Query your work tracking data using OData Analytics](../extend-analytics/wit-analytics.md)
- [Calculate time-in-state for an existing Analytics view](../powerbi/create-timeinstate-report.md) 
- [Bug trends sample report](../powerbi/sample-boards-bugtrend.md)
- [Lead time and Cycle time sample report](../powerbi/sample-boards-leadcycletime.md)
- [Pipeline pass rate trend sample report](../powerbi/sample-pipelines-pass-rate-trend.md)
- [Pipeline task duration trend sample report](../powerbi/sample-pipelines-task-duration-trend.md)

### Period enumerated type members 

The following members are defined for the `Period` enumerated type that you can use with other filter expressions to remove days that don't finish a given week or month.  Reference one of these members to specify a weekly or monthly period for trend queries that span a long time period. The `Period` enumerated type has a single attribute, `IsFlags`, which is set to `True`.
