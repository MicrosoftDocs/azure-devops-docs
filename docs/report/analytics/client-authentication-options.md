# Enter client credentials in Power BI or Excel when connecting to the Analytics Service 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

In general, the order of authentication options should be the following (in order from most secure to least secure): Azure Active Directory (**AAD**) then Personal Access Tokens (**PAT**s).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/analytics-preview.md)]

## Azure Active Directory (AAD) 

"Azure Active Directory" is also known as "Organizational Credential" in Power BI Desktop. You can use it in  [PowerBI.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) through ÄúOAuth2Äù selection when configuring data refresh.

When connecting with Power BI Desktop you will be prompted to enter your credentials for the data source. Click Organizational account as shown here:

Click the Sign in button and you will be prompted to enter your AAD credentials. After that, you're done.

To change an existing URL to use AAD instead of a PAT or AAC, see [Change authentication credentials](#update-credentials) later in this topic.

### Publish to PowerBI.com

After you have created the model and loaded it with data you can [publish it to Power BI](../powerbi/publish-power-bi-desktop-to-power-bi.md). When using AAD, make sure to select
the **oAuth2** option. 

## Create a Personal Access Token  

 Why use a Personal Access Token over an Alternate Access Credential? For these three reasons:

- As part of good password management, these tokens automatically expire so you don't have to remember to change your password
- Since PATs are a generated password, you won't use a common password as part of your AAC, which means a more limited surface area for attack  
- If you need to provide a diagnostic trace and forget to replace the value, you can simply revoke the credential thereby maintaining secure access to VSTS.


0. Log in to VSTS, open your user account menu, and select  **Security**.  

	<img src="../../_shared/_img/open-security.png" alt="User Profile, My Security menu option" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" /> 

0. From the Personal access tokens page, click **Add**:  

	<img src="../../_shared/_img/security-personal-access-tokens.png" alt="Personal Access Tokens, Added" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

0. Enter the required information: 
	- Add a description  
	- Set the expiration period  
	- Select the account 
	- Choose Selected scopes
	- Check the **Analytics (read)**
	
	And, then click **Create Token**.

0. Copy the token that displays. If you navigate away from the page, you won't be able to retrieve it later.  

	<img src="_img/client-authentication/copy-personal-access-token.png" alt="PAT created" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

0. If you need to revoke a token, simply navigate to this page and click the **Revoke** link. That token will immediately be denied access to VSTS.
	
	These tokens are your identity. When used, the token is acting as you. Keep your tokens secret and treat them like your password. To help keep your token more secure, consider using credential managers so that you don't have to enter your credentials every time you push.  

## Enter credentials within a client

Both Power BI and Excel work using Power Query when accessing OData, therefore the authentication mechanism, including the various
authentication screens are identical. This walkthrough is done using Power BI Desktop, however it also applies to Excel.

1. Open **Power BI Desktop**.  

2. Click **Get Data**.  

3. Click **OData Feed** (or More > Other > OData Feed).  

4. Enter the URL for the OData endpoint and click **OK**.  

	<img src="_img/authentication-6.png" alt="OData Feed URL" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

5. In the authentication dialog, click Basic, enter your credentials, and then click **Connect**:  
	- If you are using an AAC, enter your username and password  
	- If you are using a PAT, enter a text string, such as "test" or "user" for the username and enter the token in the password field.

## Change authentication credentials

If you receive an access denied message, you may need to change your authentication credentials. Power Query caches your credential information so you only have to enter it once. However, Personal Access Tokens expire and you may need to update or change your authentication information. 

### Update credentials in Power BI Desktop

1. Open **Power BI Desktop**.  

2. Click **File** > **Options and Settings** > **Data Source Settings**. Select the correct URL to the OData Feed and click **Edit**.  

	<img src="_img/authentication-8.png" alt="Data source settings" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />   

3. In the next **Data Source Settings** dialog, click the Edit button under the Credentials setting.   

	<img src="_img/authentication-9.png" alt="Data source settings, 2nd dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

5. Edit the credentials as noted above, click **Save**, then **Done**, then **Close**. 

### Update credentials in Excel 

1. Open **Excel** and click the **Data** tab.  

2. Click **New Query** > **Data Source Settings...**

	<img src="_img/client-auth-excel-open-data-source-settings.png" alt="Excel, Open Data source settings" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

3. Select the correct URL to the OData Feed and click **Edit**.  

	<img src="_img/authentication-8.png" alt="Excel, Data source settings" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

5. In the next **Data Source Settings** dialog, click the Edit button under the Credentials setting. 
 
	<img src="_img/authentication-9.png" alt="Data source settings, 2nd dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

6. Edit the credentials as noted above, click **Save**, then **Done**, then **Close**.
