## Manage permissions for a shared view

All members of the Contributors group for your team project can use **Shared** views in Power BI. For shared views that you create, you can manage the permissions of users and groups to create, delete, or view a specific shared view.

1. To change the permissions for a shared view, click the ![](/vsts/report/_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon and choose the **Security** option.

1. Change the permissions so that the team member or group can't edit or delete the view.

1. Add a user or group who you want to grant permissions to or restrict access.
