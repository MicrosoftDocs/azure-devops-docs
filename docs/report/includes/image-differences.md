> [!NOTE]  
>The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this article. These differences result from updates made to Azure DevOps, [options that you or your admin have enabled](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md), and which process was chosen when creating your project&mdash;[Agile](../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md). However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned. For an overview of changes in the navigation experience, see [Web portal navigation](../../project/navigation/index.md#admin-context).
