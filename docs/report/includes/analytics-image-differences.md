> [!NOTE]  
> The labels you see for the list of default Analytics views will differ depending on the process that was chosen when creating your team project&mdash;[Basic](../../boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards.md), [Agile](../../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../../boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md). However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned.
