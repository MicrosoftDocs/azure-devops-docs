## Open Analytics to access views

Default Analytics views are defined for each project. You can view, modify, and create a custom view from **Analytics**. 

If you don't see the project you want, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../powerbi/media/azure_devops.png" border="false"::: Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects](../../project/navigation/work-across-projects.md).  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

From your web portal, expand **Overview** and choose **Analytics views**.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
If you don't see **Analytics**, check that it's enabled for the project collection and that you have permissions to view Analytics. See the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for this article.
