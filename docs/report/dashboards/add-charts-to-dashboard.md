## In-context work tracking reports 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can add each of the in-context Analytics reports to a dashboard. 

1. Simply open the report, choose the ![ ](_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon and select **Copy to Dashboard**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Analytics in-context report, Copy to dashboard](_img/add-charts/add-analytics-chart.png)  

	To open a report, see [Cumulate Flow Diagram](cumulative-flow.md#view-the-cfd-in-context-report), [Velocity](team-velocity.md#view-the-velocity-in-context-report), or [Sprint burndown](configure-sprint-burndown.md#view-context-report).

1. Choose the dashboard and choose **OK**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Analytics in-context report, Copy to dashboard](_img/add-charts/select-a-dashboard-dialogue.png)  

1. (Optional) Open the dashboard and choose the ![ ](_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon for the widget to configure the size or change other report properties. 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 < azure-devops"

There are a number of in-context reports that you can access from the web portal, but can't add to a dashboard. However, you may find a comparable widget listed in the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) that tracks the same or similar data which you can add to the dashboard. These include: 

- [Add Markdown to a dashboard](add-markdown-to-dashboard.md)
- [Team velocity](../guidance/team-velocity.md)
- [View/configure sprint burndown](configure-sprint-burndown.md), see [Sprint burndown widget](widget-catalog.md#sprint-burndown-widget)
- [Cumulative flow](../guidance/cumulative-flow.md), see [CFD widget](widget-catalog.md#cfd-widget)

<a id="build-history"></a>

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"

## Add a build history chart

Each time a build is run, it logs information about the build, including the run time, errors and warnings, and whether it successfully completed or failed.   

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also add this chart to a team dashboard from the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md#build-history-widget).  

1. Select your [team context](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/toc.json) and then open **Pipelines>Builds** to add a build history chart to a team dashboard. (Requires TFS 2015.1 or later version).  

	![Add a build summary chart to a dashboard](_img/add-chart-build-summary.png)  

	If you aren't a team administrator, [get added as one](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md). The Add to dashboard menu selection is disabled when you don't have permissions to add it to the dashboards of the selected team context.  

2. Build summary charts look like this:  

	![Add a test plan chart to a dashboard](_img/add-a-dashboard-build-summary.png)  

	Hover over a bar to view build information and run time. Choose a bar to go to the build summary page.   

::: moniker-end

<a id="release-summary"></a> 
::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"  
 
## Add a release summary chart  

Each time a release is deployed, it logs information about the release to each of its environments. You can add a release tile to your team dashboard to monitor release progress and gain quick access to each release. 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also add this chart to a team dashboard from the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md#release-definition-widget).  

1. Open **Pipelines>Releases** to add a release definition chart to a team dashboard.   
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Add a Release pipeline chart to a dashboard, new nav](_img/add-charts/add-release-pipeline-to-dashboard-new-nav.png)   

2. Release pipeline charts show the success (green), in progress (blue), cancellation (red), or non-deployment (grey) to an environment for the current and last four releases:  

	![Release pipeline tile](_img/add-cd-release-definition-tile.png)

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"
<a id="test-result">  </a>  

## Add a manual test status or result chart  

As you create and run tests, you can track your status by defining [lightweight charts of test plans and test results](../../test/track-test-status.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also add a [Chart for test plans widget](widget-catalog.md#chart-test-plan-widget) to a dashboard. 

1. Select your [team context](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/toc.json), make sure you're a [team admin](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md).  

1. Open **Test>Test Plans** and then **Charts** and select the dashboard to add the test chart to.  

	![Add a test plan chart to a dashboard](_img/add-a-chart-test-plan.png)  
   ::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
<a id="test-quality"></a>  

## Add a test quality trend chart   

You can add trends to the dashboard of the failures and duration of those [tests that were run as part of a build](../../pipelines/ecosystems/dotnet-core.md#run-your-tests).
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"
> [!NOTE]  
> You can also add a [test result trend chart widget](widget-catalog.md#test-results-widget) to a dashboard. 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2017"  
Requires TFS 2017.2 or later version.  
::: moniker-end  


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"  

1. Select your [team context](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/toc.json), make sure you're a [team admin](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md).  

2. Open a build summary for a build pipeline to which you've added tests, open the Tests page, and choose the bar chart for either Test failures or Test duration.    

	![Add a test plan chart to a dashboard](_img/add-chart-test-quality.png)  

3. Open the ![ ](_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions menu and choose the dashboard to add the chart to.  

	![Open Actions menu and select dashboard](_img/add-chart-test-failures.png)  

	Learn more about [reviewing automated test results after a build](../../pipelines/test/review-continuous-test-results-after-build.md).  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"
<a id="work-item-query"></a>

## Add a work item query or chart  

You add work item queries and charts to a dashboard from the Queries page. Queries and charts must be associated with queries under the Shared queries folder.  

> [!NOTE]  
> You can also add a [work item query chart widget](widget-catalog.md#build-history-widget) to a team dashboard.  

1. First, make sure you have selected your team context. Only those dashboards created for a team appear in the context menu for each query or chart. [Switch team context](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/toc.json) as needed.  

2. If you aren't a team administrator, [get added as one](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can add and customize team dashboards.  

3. If you haven't yet created the dashboard, [do that now](dashboards.md).  

4. From the charts Actions menu, choose the team dashboard.  

	![Chart context menu, add to a dashboard](_img/pin-chart-to-a-dashboard.png)  

	You can only add charts associated with shared queries. Charts associated with queries under My Queries folder won't display the add to dashboard option.

## Add a markdown file to a dashboard  

Open the Markdown file defined in your repository and make sure you are in your team context. 

Choose **Add to dashboard**, and then choose the team dashboard to add the markdown file to. As you update the Markdown file, changes will automatically appear on the dashboard upon refresh. See [Dashboards](dashboards.md) for more info.
