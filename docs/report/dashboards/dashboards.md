Share progress and status with your team using configurable team dashboards. Dashboards provide easy-to-read, easy access, real-time information. At a glance, you can make informed decisions without having to drill down into other parts of your project. 
::: moniker-end

 
When a project is first created, a default team and default team dashboard is created labeled *Overview*. You can customize this dashboard by adding widgets. Each widget provides access to one or more features or functions. To learn more about each widget, see [Widget catalog](widget-catalog.md). 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

## Project and team dashboards

When you add a dashboard, you can choose to make it a project dashboard or one specific to a team. Use project dashboards to display information or status about the project or when you want to control who can edit the dashboard. Use team dashboards to focus information specific to a team. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Project dashboards are owned by the person that created the dashboard. The owner can set permissions as to who can edit the dashboard. Team dashboards are owned by team administrators and can be edited by any member of the team. All dashboards can be viewed by members of the project. All widgets available to team dashboards are available for project dashboards. For team-specific widgets, if you aren't able to select a team through the widget, then the team defaults to the default project team.

## Open Dashboards 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

All dashboards are associated with either a team or a project. From the **Overview>Dashboards** page, you can browse all dashboards and see which team they belong to, or if they are project dashboard.  
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"  

All dashboards are associated with a team. From the **Overview>Dashboards** page, you can browse all dashboards and see which team they belong to.  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

Open a web browser, connect to your project, and select **Overview>Dashboards**. The dashboard directory page opens. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Dashboards Directory, new navigation](media/dashboards/open-dashboards-vert.png)

It lists dashboards in the following order: 
- Your last visited dashboard
- Your favorited dashboards
- All dashboards of teams that you belong to
- All dashboards defined for the project in alphabetical order. 

Select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/filter-icon.png" border="false"::: filter icon to filter the list by keyword or team. Keywords apply to dashboard titles, descriptions, and team names.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Filter the dashboard directory](media/dashboards/filter-directory.png)   

If you need to switch to a different project, select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/project-icon.png" border="false"::: Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).  

::: moniker-end  


::: moniker range="tfs-2018"  
Open a web browser, connect to your project, and select **Dashboards**. 

![Dashboards directory, previous navigation](media/dashboards-go-to.png) 

If you need to switch to a different project, select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/project-icon.png" border="false"::: Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

## Select a dashboard 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Select a dashboard from the directory list, or from the selector. To return to the dashboard directory, select the **Browse all dashboards** option. 
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Dashboards, Browse all dashboards option](media/dashboards/browse-all-dashboards.png)

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Dashboards, Favorite a dashboard](media/dashboards/favorite-dashboard.png)  

	Favoriting a dashboard will cause it to appear under **My Favorites dashboards** list on the dashboards directory. Also, it will appear towards the top in the **Dashboards** selector and in your [personal Favorites list](../../project/navigation/set-favorites.md). 

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

## Add a dashboard 

Add a new dashboard as needed to support your team's needs. You can also edit and rename any existing dashboards associated with your team.


> [!NOTE]

![Add and name a dashboard](media/dashboards-new-ts.png) 

If you don't see :::image type="icon" source="../../boards/media/icons/green_plus_icon.png" border="false"::: **Edit** icon, then you're not a team admin for the currently selected team, or you don't have permissions to add and edit dashboards. Either [switch the context to your team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/dashboards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/dashboards/toc.json), or request you be added as a [team admin](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/dashboards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/dashboards/toc.json).

## Move or delete a widget 

Just as you have to be a team admin, a project admin, or have the necessary permissions to add items to a dashboard, you must have the [necessary permissions](#permissions) to remove items.  

> [!TIP]   
> When you're in dashboard edit mode, you can remove, rearrange, and configure widgets, as well as add new widgets. Once you leave edit mode, the widget tiles remain locked, reducing the chances of accidentally moving a widget.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
Select :::image type="icon" source="media/icons/edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Edit** to modify your dashboard. 

You can now add widgets or drag tiles to reorder their sequence on the dashboard. 

To remove a widget, select ![actions icon](../../media/icons/actions-icon.png) **More actions** and select **Delete** .  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Delete a widget from a dashboard](media/dashboards/delete-widget.png) 

When you're finished with your changes, select **Done Editing** to exit dashboard edit mode.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"  
Select ![Edit dashboard icon](media/edit-dashboard-icon.png) to modify your dashboard. You can then drag tiles to reorder their sequence on the dashboard. 

You can now add widgets or drag tiles to reorder their sequence on the dashboard. 

To remove a widget, select the widget's ![Trash icon](media/dashboard-trash-icon.png) or ![Delete icon](media/dashboard-delete-icon.png) delete icons. 

When you're finished with your changes, select ![Exit edit-dashboard-mode icon](media/exit-edit-dashboard-mode-icon.png) to exit dashboard editing.

::: moniker-end
