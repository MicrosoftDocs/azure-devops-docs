# Add and manage dashboards

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1**


Share progress and status with your team using configurable team dashboards. Dashboards provide easy-to-read, easy access, real-time information. At a glance, you can make informed decisions without having to drill down into other parts of your team project site. 

The Overview page provides access to a default team dashboard which you can customize by adding, removing, or rearranging the tiles. Each tile corresponds to a widget that provides access to one or more features or functions.   


::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]   
> Multiple team dashboards and the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) are available from TFS 2015.1 or later versions. For TFS 2015 and earlier versions, you don't have access to multiple team dashboards. Instead, your home page serves as a [single team dashboard](team-dashboard.md). For information on SharePoint dashboards, see [Project portal dashboards](../sharepoint-dashboards/project-portal-dashboards.md).

## Connect to the web portal for your team project 

Open a browser window and choose the **Dashboards** hub. 

![Open the Dashboards hub](_img/dashboards-go-to.png) 

<!---The URL follows this pattern: 
- VSTS: ```https://{account name}.visualstudio.com/{project name}/_backlogs```  
- Team Foundation Server (on-premises): ```http://{server}:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/{project name}/_backlogs```  
-->
If you don't see the team or team project you want, click the ![project icon](../../work/_img/icons/project-icon.png) project icon to [browse all team projects and teams](../../user-guide/account-home-pages.md).    
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"

## Select a dashboard to view 

All dashboards are associated with a team.

# [New Dashboards Experience](#tab/new-query-exp) 

::: moniker range="vsts"

To enable the New Dashboard experience, see [Enable preview features](../../collaborate/preview-features.md).  

1. From the **Dashboards** hub, open the selector and choose  the **Browse all dashboards** option. 
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Dashboards hub, Browse all dashboards option](_img/dashboards/browse-all-dashboards.png)  

2. The **Mine** page shows your favorited dashboards, and all dashboards of teams that you belong to. The **All** page (shown below) lists all dashboards defined for the team project in alphabetical order. You can filter the list by team or by keyword.   
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Dashboards hub, Browse all dashboards option](_img/dashboards/all-dashboards-list.png)  

	> [!TIP]
	> You can change the sort order of the list by clicking the column label. However, you can't change the column size of the displayed columns. 
	 
3. To favorite a dashboard, hover over the dashboard and choose the ![star icon](../../_img/icons/icon-favorite-star.png).  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Dashboards hub, Browse all dashboards option](_img/dashboards/favorite-dashboard.png)  

	Favoriting a dashboard will cause it to appear on your Favorites page, and appear towards the top in the Dashboards selection menu.

	> ![Create a dashboard dialog](_img/dashboards/create-dashboard-bug-status.png)  

	Choose **Save**. 

3.  The widget catalog opens. You can add one or more widgets to the dashboard. You can then configure and resize each widget as needed. 

4.	You can move the widgets around the dashboard to place them where you want them. 

5.  When you're done making changes, choose **Done Editing**.

## Try this next 

As you can see, you can use team dashboards to provide guidance and keep your team in sync, providing visibility across your org about status, trends, and progress.

> [Add a widget to a dashboard](add-widget-to-dashboard.md)

See these additional resources to help you support your team:  
- [Review the widget catalog](widget-catalog.md)
- [Review Marketplace widgets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=widget&target=VSTS&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance)


### Extensibility 

Using the REST API service, you can [create a dashboard widget](../../extend/develop/add-dashboard-widget.md). To learn more about the REST APIs for dashboards and widgets, see [Dashboards (API)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts/dashboard/dashboards).  

::: moniker-end

<!---  
Only dashboard owners can change the configuration of their dashboards.  

To add a widget, click ![add a widget icon](_img/add-widget-icon.png). The [Widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) provides descriptions of each available widget.   
To add an item, see [add items to the dashboard](#pin-items). 

You can reorder dashboard widgets through drag-and-drop. And remove widgets or items.

Click ![add icon](../../Work/_img/icons/green_plus_icon.png) to [add another dashboard.  

 Or add items to this dashboard and re-sequence tiles. Each tile provides team members quick access to the progress of their builds, work item status and trends, Git repositories or version control folders.

## Add items to a dashboard 

You add an item to the team dashboard from the code, work, and build pages.  

1.  If you aren't a team administrator, [get added as one](#add-team-admin).  

2.	Add a work item query from its context menu.</p>

	![Add a query to a dashboard](_img/vso-pin-query-from-context-menu.png)

	To add a source control folder or a build definition, open the corresponding page and access the pin feature in the same way.    

3.	To add a chart, go to the query's Charts page and add it to your selected dashboard or the team homepage.  

	![Chart context menu, add to a dashboard](_img/pin-chart-to-a-dashboard.png)  

4.	Drag tiles or widgets to reorder their sequence on the dashboard.    

	Using Internet Explorer 10 or Internet Explorer 11, you can also tab to a tile and press Shift+L or Shift+R to move the selected tile to the left or to the right.

5.	Choose a tile, widget, or link to open it. 



<a id="pin-items">  </a> 
### Add an item or a chart to your dashboard 

You add an item to a dashboard from the code, work, and build pages. 

First, make sure you have the team context selected from the Queries page to which you want to add a query or chart. 

For example, select the context menu of a query that you want to add to the dashboard. This is the same as adding a query tile widget. 

![Add a shared query to a team dashboard](_img/add-to-dashboard-shared-query.png)  

And, you can add a chart to a team dashboard in a similar way.  

<img src="_img/add-to-dashboard-shared-query-chart.png" alt="Add a chart to a team dashboard" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  


<a id="edit-dashboard"></a>
## Add widgets to your dashboard

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b>Dashboard edit mode controls shown appear from VSTS or TFS 2015.2 or later version. Some functionality differs when you connect to an application server running TFS 2015.1 or later version.   

### Add a widget  

Click ![Edit dashboard icon](_img/edit-dashboard-icon.png) to modify a dashboard. Click ![add a widget icon](_img/add-widget-icon.png) to add a widget to the dashboard.
  
> [!NOTE]  
> **Feature availability:**  From VSTS and TFS 2017 and later versions, you can drag and drop a widget from the catalog onto the dashboard. 

The [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) describes all the available widgets, many of which are scoped to the selected team context.  

 

### Configure a widget  
After you add the widget, you may need to configure it. For example, to configure the Query tile widget, click the ![Configure widget icon](_img/icons/configure-icon.png) or the ![Actions icon](_img/icons/actions-icon.png) to open the configuration dialog.

![Query tile unconfigured widget](_img/widget-query-tile-unconfigured.png)

And then select the query and specify any rules you want. (For TFS 2015.1 and later versions, you can only specify the green and red flag limits.)  

#### Configuration dialog for query tile  

<img src="_img/dashboards-query-tile-config-ts.png" alt="Query tile configuration dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
