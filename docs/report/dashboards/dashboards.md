# Add, rename, and delete dashboards in Azure DevOps

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)] 

Share progress and status with your team using configurable team dashboards. Dashboards provide easy-to-read, easy access, real-time information. At a glance, you can make informed decisions without having to drill down into other parts of your project. 

The Overview page provides access to a default team dashboard which you can customize by adding, removing, or rearranging the tiles. Each tile corresponds to a widget that provides access to one or more features or functions.   


::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]   
> Multiple team dashboards and the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) are available from TFS 2015.1 or later versions. For TFS 2015 and earlier versions, you don't have access to multiple team dashboards. Instead, your home page serves as a [single team dashboard](team-dashboard.md). For information on SharePoint dashboards, see [Project portal dashboards](../sharepoint-dashboards/project-portal-dashboards.md).

## Connect to your project 

All dashboards are associated with a team.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

Open a web browser, connect to your project, and choose **Overview>Dashboards**. The dashboard directory page opens. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Dashboards Directory, new navigation](_img/dashboards/open-dashboards-vert.png)

It lists dashboards in the following order: 
- Your last visited dashboard
- Your favorited dashboards
- All dashboards of teams that you belong to
- All dashboards defined for the project in alphabetical order. 

Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/filter-icon.png) filter icon to filter the list by keyword or team. Keywords apply to dashboard titles, descriptions, and team names.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Filter the dashboard directory](_img/dashboards/filter-directory.png)   

If you need to switch to a different project, choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).  

::: moniker-end  


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"  
Open a web browser, connect to your project, and choose **Dashboards**. 

![Dashboards directory, previous navigation](_img/dashboards-go-to.png) 

If you need to switch to a different project, choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).  

::: moniker-end



<a id="choose-dashboard" />

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
## Select a dashboard 

1. Choose a dashboard from the directory list, or from the selector. To return to the dashboard directory, choose the **Browse all dashboards** option. 
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Dashboards, Browse all dashboards option](_img/dashboards/browse-all-dashboards.png)  
	 
1. To favorite a dashboard, hover over the dashboard and choose the ![star icon](../../_img/icons/icon-favorite-star.png).  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Dashboards, Favorite a dashboard](_img/dashboards/favorite-dashboard.png)  

	Favoriting a dashboard will cause it to appear under **My Favorites dashboards** list on the dashboards directory. Also, it will appear towards the top in the **Dashboards** selector and in your [personal Favorites list](../../project/navigation/set-favorites.md). . 

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015  <= tfs-2018"  

## Select a dashboard 

1. Select the team whose dashboards you want to view. To switch your team focus, see [Switch project, repo or team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md#switch-team-context).

2. From **Dashboards**, choose the name of the dashboard to view it. 

	For example, here we choose to view the Work in Progress dashboard. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Dashboards, Choose a team dashboard](_img/dashboards/choose-dashboard.png)  

::: moniker-end  


## Add a dashboard 

Add a new dashboard as needed to support your team's needs. You can also edit and rename any existing dashboards associated with your team.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. From the Dashboards directory, choose **New Dashboard**. Or, when viewing a dashboard, open the selector and choose the ![plus icon](_img/icons/blue-plus-icon.png) **New Dashboard** option. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open the create a dashboard dialog](_img/dashboards/open-new-dashboard-dialog.png)  

	If you don't see the ![plus icon](_img/icons/blue-plus-icon.png) **New Dashboard** option, then you're not a team admin for the currently selected team, or you don't have permissions to add and edit dashboards. Either [switch the context to your team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/toc.json), or request you be added as a [team admin](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/toc.json). 

2. Enter the name of the dashboard and other information you want to capture. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create a dashboard dialog](_img/dashboards/create-dashboard-bug-status.png)  

	Choose **Save**. 

3.  The widget catalog opens. You can add one or more widgets to the dashboard. You can then configure and resize each widget as needed. 

4.	You can move the widgets around the dashboard to place them where you want them. 

5.  When you're done making changes, choose **Done Editing**. 
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015  <= tfs-2018"  
From **Dashboards**, choose the ![plus icon](../../boards/_img/icons/green_plus_icon.png) and enter a dashboard name. 

![Add and name a dashboard](_img/dashboards-new-ts.png) 

If you don't see the ![plus icon](../../boards/_img/icons/green_plus_icon.png), then you're not a team admin for the currently selected team, or you don't have permissions to add and edit dashboards. Either [switch the context to your team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/dashboards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/dashboards/toc.json), or request you be added as a [team admin](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md?toc=/azure/devops/report/dashboards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/report/breadcrumb/dashboards/toc.json). 

With the dashboard selected, you can add [widgets and charts to the dashboard](add-widget-to-dashboard.md). Or, you can [add charts to a team dashboard from the Work, Build, or Test pages](add-charts-to-dashboard.md).

## Move or delete a widget 

> [!NOTE]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015  <= tfs-2018"

> [!TIP]   
> When you're in dashboard edit mode, you can remove, rearrange, and configure widgets, as well as add new widgets. Once you leave edit mode, the widget tiles remain locked, reducing the chances of accidentally moving a widget.
