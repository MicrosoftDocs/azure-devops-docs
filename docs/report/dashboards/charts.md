# Track progress with status and trend query-based charts

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You can quickly view the status of work in progress by charting the results of a [flat-list query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md#define-a-flat-list-query). Queries support different chart views, such as pie, column, pivot, or trend. Charts support viewing a count of work items or a sum of values for select numeric fields, such as Story Points, Effort, or Remaining Work. Group work by State, Assigned To, or other custom or system defined field.

In this article you learn how to perform the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Construct a flat-list query to support your chart
> - Create and share your query-based chart
> - Create a status pie, column, bar, or pivot chart
> - Create a trend chart
> - Add a chart to a dashboard

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to configure work tracking query charts. To add existing query charts to dashboards, see [Add charts to a dashboard](add-charts-to-dashboard.md). For information on configuring a **Chart for Work Items** widget, see [Configure a chart for work items widget](configure-chart-work-items-widget.md).

### Create a flat-list query  

When creating a query to support your chart, follow these guidelines.

- Always select the **Flat list of work items** query type. Other query types aren't supported for charting. For more information, see [Define a flat-list query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md#flat-list).
- Add those fields to either a query clause or the column options that you want to use within your chart. You can group charts by any field except date-time, free-form text, and tag fields. For example:

  - To group by status, include the **State** field.
  - To group by work assignments, include the **Assigned To** field.
  - To group by sprints or iterations, include the **Iteration Path**.
  - To group by team, include the **Node Name** field that displays the leaf node of the Area Path.
  - To group by a custom field, include it.  

- To sum a numeric column, include the corresponding field in your query clause or column options. For more examples of charts created from numeric fields, see [Query by numeric fields](../../boards/queries/query-numeric.md).
- If you plan to add your query to a dashboard, [save your query as a Shared query](../../boards/queries/organize-queries.md).
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2022"
- You can't group charts by the following field data types:

  - ID
  - Date-time, such as Created Date, Changed Date
  - Plain text, such as Title
  - Rich-text, such as Description, Repro Steps
  - Tags

> [!NOTE]
> You can't group a query-based chart by tags, however, you can group a **Chart for Work Items** widget by tags that you add to a dashboard as described in [Configure a chart for work items widget](configure-chart-work-items-widget.md).  

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"
- You can't group charts by the following field data types:

  - ID
  - Date-time, such as **Created Date**, **Changed Date**
  - Plain text, such as **Title**
  - Rich-text, such as **Description**, **Repro Steps**
  - Tags (You can filter a query using tags, but you can't use tags to configure your chart)
::: moniker-end

#### Display of areas and iterations

When you select **Area Path** or **Iteration Path**, only the leaf node appears in the chart. The leaf node is the last node of the full path. For example, `Phone` is the leaf node of `FabrikamFiber/Fabrikam Website/Phone`. If your query contains a mixed level of leaf nodes, your chart might not reflect expected results.  

Select the **Node Name** field, the area path leaf node, to see if that improves your results.

Charts display in browsers that support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Supported browsers include Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 9 and later versions, Chrome, Firefox and Safari on Mac. Charts aren't optimized for mobile or touch displays.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"
> [!NOTE]
> Internet Explorer is no longer supported for Azure DevOps Services or for Azure DevOps Server 2020.1.

::: moniker-end

#### Sort by Value or Label

Most charts allow you to choose how you want to sort the data. You can sort by **Value** or **Label** and select **Ascending** or **Descending**.

- **Value**: Sorts data by the numeric value
- **Label**: Sorts by the label selected for grouping the data

#### Limited display of series

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 
When a chart contains more than 8 or 12 items within the data series, values in the 9 or 13-plus items are consolidated into a set labeled *(other)*. However, if you increase the chart size through the configurable widget on a dashboard you can increase the series limit.  

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/other-12-series.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Other category groups data beyond 12 set series.":::  

::: moniker-end

## Chart availability

- All team members can view charts saved under **Shared Queries**, except members with **Stakeholder** access. You can add those charts to dashboards.
- Only you can view queries under your **My Queries** folder.
- You can copy and email the URL of any chart page to share it with a project member.
- To create similar charts for tests, see [Track test status](../../test/track-test-status.md).

## Create a query-based chart  

1. From **Queries**, open the chart editor for a flat-list query. To create charts, belong to the Contributors group.

   ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
   :::image type="content" source="media/charts/new-chart-new-qe.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Charts tab with the New chart button.":::
   ::: moniker-end  

   If you have **Stakeholder** access, the **Charts** and **New Chart** links don't appear.

1. Select the chart type and field for grouping values. When you use pie, bar, and column charts, select a single field to view a count of work items.  
   ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

   :::image type="content" source="media/charts/config-pie-chart-priority-qe.png" alt-text="Screenshot of pie chart configure dialog.":::  
   ::: moniker-end  

   If you don't see the field you want in the **Group by** dropdown list, [add the field as a column to the query and save the query](../../boards/backlogs/set-column-options.md). Also, the **Aggregation** options depend on the fields used in the query or the fields selected from the **Column Options**.  

   If you receive an error message when you close the chart editor, you need to request Basic access. For more information, see [Change access levels](../../organizations/security/change-access-levels.md).

1. To sort the results, select **Value** or **Label** as the sort option and then **Ascending** or **Descending**.  

   ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  
   To change a color, select a color from the Series set of color pickers.

   :::image type="content" source="media/charts/color-series-picker.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Charts dialog, color series picker.":::  
   ::: moniker-end  

Charts automatically update when you edit the query or refresh the query results.  

<a id="pie-chart"></a> 

## Add a Pie chart

Use a pie chart to show group percentages with six or fewer categories. Good examples of pie charts are:

- Active Bugs Status, group by State
- User Story Status, group by State
- User Story Progress, group by Completed, In Progress, or Cut

For example, the following query filters User Stories based on the State for Cut, In Progress, and Completed since the start of the year.

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/pie-chart-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Query Editor, filter User Stories by State.":::

The pie chart configuration is as shown in the following image.

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/pie-chart-configured.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Configure chart dialog, Pie chart.":::

The combined query and chart configuration yield the following pie chart.

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/pie-chart-user-stories-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Charts, pie chart example.":::  

## Add a Stacked bar chart

A stacked bar chart lets you track progress against two field values. Node Name displays the last leaf within an area path. Use this approach when you want to show data across teams and each node corresponds to a team.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/config-stacked-bar-chart-team-qe.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Configure chart dialog, Stacked bar chart.":::
::: moniker-end  

## Add a Pivot table  

The Pivot table displays a table of configurable rows and columns, with columns showing a count of work items or sum of a numeric field. Choose a Pivot table when you want to compare across areas the work being performed.

The following image shows an example of work item types and their current state.  

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/configure-pivot-item-state.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Configure Chart dialog, Pivot table.":::

## Add a Trend chart

Trend charts let you view progress over time. You can select a rolling period ranging from the last week to the last year.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/config-2-week-trend-chart-bugs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Configure chart dialog, two week trend chart.":::
::: moniker-end  

Trend data is extracted from the work tracking data store. Like most data stores, the schema of the relational database is designed and optimized for the online transactional processing of data. As the tool or plug-in performs an activity, it writes the latest information to the operational store. Data in the operational store is constantly changing and being updated. All data is current.

## Add a Burndown chart

Burndown charts are useful for determining how quickly work is progressing based on a numeric field value, such as Story Points, Effort, or Remaining Work, or on a count of work items.

To create a burndown chart, add the numeric field you want to your query. To view a burndown chart of tasks, select the **Sum** operator for **Remaining Work**.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/config-remaining-work-trend-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Configure chart dialog, Remaining work for past four weeks.":::

In addition to query-based burndown charts, you can [Configure a burndown or burnup widget](configure-burndown-burnup-widgets.md).

::: moniker-end  

## Add chart to a dashboard

Add a chart to a dashboard is through the addition of a **Chart for Work Items** widget. You can add the chart to a dashboard as shown in the following procedure, or by adding the **Chart for Work Items** widget directly. For more information, see [Configure a chart for work items widget](configure-chart-work-items-widget.md).

> [!TIP]
> All query charts are limited in size. You can resize and configure charts that you add to a dashboard by opening the **Chart for Work Items** widget used to display them.

- Select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon for the chart you want to add, and select **Add to dashboard**.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/add-chart-to-dashboard-qe.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Chart context menu, Add to dashboard option.":::

Only queries that are saved to a **Shared Queries** folder have the **Add to dashboard** menu option.

In the dialog that opens, select the dashboard to add the chart to.

:::image type="content" source="media/charts/select-dashboard-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Select a dashboard dialog.":::  
::: moniker-end

To add other types of charts, such as test results and build summary charts, see [Add widgets and chart to a dashboard](add-widget-to-dashboard.md).

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

## Query-based charts versus Excel-generated PivotCharts

Query-based charts generate data from the work item tracking data store. The charts display the most recent data. [Excel PivotCharts](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/create-status-and-trend-excel-reports) access data published to the Analysis Services cube, which is refreshed every two hours by default. Excel charts require that your project's project collection is configured with SQL Server Reporting Services and Analysis Services.
