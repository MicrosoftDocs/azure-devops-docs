As a member of the Project Administrators group, you can set the default dashboard permissions for all teams. As a team or project administrator, you can set individual dashboard permissions for team members. The permissions only affect the team members to which the dashboards belongs.

To learn more about adding and viewing dashboards, see [Add, rename, and delete dashboards](dashboards.md).   

> [!TIP]    
> If a user reports that they can't create or edit a team dashboard, and you've set the permissions to allow them to do so, check that they have been added as a member of the team. This includes adding them as a team member to the default project team. For details, see [Add users to a project or specific team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).

## Set default dashboard permissions for a project

By default, all team members have permissions to edit dashboards defined for the team. All other valid users of the project have view only permissions, except for members of the Project Administrators group. You can change the default permissions a project from the Project settings.

## Set individual dashboard permissions for team members

By default, all team members have permissions to edit dashboards defined for the team. All other valid users of the project have view only permissions, except for administrators. You can change the view, edit, and manage permissions for all team dashboards for members of your team. 

1. To change the permissions for a specific dashboard, open the dashboard and then choose the ![configure icon](_img/icons/configure-icon.png) wrench icon for the dashboard.

	For example, here we open the Manage Dashboards dialog for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team's Test dashboard. 

	![Open Manage dashboards dialog](_img/dashboards-configure-ts.png) 

2. Choose the **Permissions** tab and check those checkboxes to grant or restrict permissions to your team members to edit and manage team dashboards. The default settings, as shown in the illustration, provide all team members permissions to edit and manage dashboards.  

	> [!NOTE]   
	> The dashboard security dialog doesn't support granting permissions to other users or groups.  

	::: moniker range="tfs-2018"  
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Manage dashboards - permissions dialog, Azure DevOps and TFS 2018](_img/dashboards-permissions.png)   
	::: moniker-end  
	::: moniker range="tfs-2017"  
	Requires TFS 2017.1 or later version.   

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Manage dashboards - permissions dialog, 2017.1](_img/dashboards-permissions-tfs.png) 
	::: moniker-end

3. Choose **Save** to save your changes and dismiss the Settings dialog.
