Dashboards are viewable by all members of the Project Valid Users group. Permissions to edit, delete, or manage dashboards can be configured for both team and project dashboards.

As a member of the Project Administrators group, you can set the default dashboard permissions for all teams. As a team or project administrator, you have the flexibility to set individual dashboard permissions for team members. This enables you to tailor permissions based on the specific needs and roles of each team member. These permissions only impact the team members and their respective team dashboards, allowing for granular control over who can edit, delete, or manage dashboards.

By configuring these permissions, you ensure that only authorized users can make changes to dashboards, maintaining the integrity and organization of your project data.

For more information about adding and viewing dashboards, see [Add, rename, and delete dashboards](dashboards.md).   

> [!TIP]
> If a user reports that they can't create or edit a team dashboard despite having the necessary permissions, ensure they are added as a member of the team. This includes adding them as a member of the default project team. For more information, see [Add users to a project or specific team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).

## Set default team dashboard permissions

By default, all team members have permissions to create and edit dashboards for their teams. All members of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators group and team administrators can set the default dashboard permissions for a team.

1. Select **Project settings** > **Dashboards**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of Web portal, Project Settings, open Dashboards, Azure DevOps Server 2019.](media/set-permissions/project-setting-permissions.png)

2. Move the toggle to enable or disable those permissions you want to grant or restrict. 
   
   The system automatically saves your changes.

## Set individual team dashboard permissions 

> [!NOTE]
> The dashboard permissions dialog currently doesn't support granting permissions to other users or groups. You can only modify the default settings for the team.
