# Configure and monitor sprint burndown 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]


::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

Throughout your sprint, you can monitor the sprint burndown report to determine if your team is on track to complete its [sprint plan](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md). There are two sprint accessible burndown charts: the in-context Burndown Trend report viewable from a team sprint backlog and the Sprint Burndown widget you can add to a dashboard. 

Both the report and the widget derive data from [Analytics](../powerbi/what-is-analytics.md). They support monitoring burndown based on a count of work items or a sum of Story Points/Size/Effort, Remaining Work, or other numeric field. 

You can add either the report or widget to a dashboard. Also, you can monitor progress using the [Analytics-based burndown or burnup widgets](configure-burndown-burnup-widgets.md). They provide more configuration options.

Throughout your sprint, you can monitor the sprint burndown report to determine if your team is on track to complete its [sprint plan](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md). The in-context sprint burndown report supports tracking burndown based on Remaining Work assigned to sprint tasks. If you don't track tasks or Remaining Work, then you can use the [Analytics-based burndown and burnup widgets](configure-burndown-burnup-widgets.md). They provide more configuration options.

## The in-context Burndown Trend report

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

The Burndown Trend report is based on either a count of tasks or remaining work estimates, or other numeric fields that you define and update throughout the sprint cycle. For details, see [Sprint planning](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md). To open this report, jump to the section [Open a Sprint backlog](#open-chart).   

A healthy sprint burndown report looks something like the image shown below. Typically, there will be a stair-case burndown as individual team members may only update their work items once a week or every few days. 
The **Total Scope** line indicates the number of work items added after the sprint starts. The **Ideal Trend** line is calculated based on the number of work items, days in the sprint, and number of working days.  

The blue area indicates the number of work items active or in progress each day of the sprint. As shown in this example, one work item is still active at the end of the sprint.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/note-working-days-off.md)]

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Select another team](media/burndown/analytics-burndown-stories-count-past-s159.png) 

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Total Scope** line reflects the number of work items added to the sprint. If the team's default iteration is the **\@CurrentIteration**, then new work items are added to the current iteration. The scope decreases as the Iteration Path is modified to another sprint, or work items are completed.  

::: moniker-end
 

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2020"

The in-context sprint burndown report is based on the tasks and Remaining Work estimates you define and update throughout the sprint cycle. For details, see [Sprint planning](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) and [taskboard](../../boards/sprints/task-board.md). To open the sprint burndown chart, jump to the section [Open sprint burndown chart](#open-chart).   

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   
   A healthy sprint burndown chart will look something like this. The <em>Ideal Trend</em> line connects the two points: 

   - **(1)** Team&#39;s total capacity at the start of the sprint.  
   - **(2)** 0 Remaining Work at the end of the sprint.
   
   The slope represents the rate at which the team needs to burn down work to finish the sprint on time. 

   The actual graph, the blue area, represents the total amount of planned sprint work and how it changes throughout the course of the sprint. The blue area corresponds to the sum of all Remaining Work set for all sprint tasks, and possibly bugs, that have the current sprint as their iteration path.

## The Sprint Burndown widget

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

In the widget catalog, you'll find two versions of the Sprint Burndown widget:  the Analytics-based **Sprint Burndown** and **Sprint Burndown (Legacy)** which is built from the work tracking data store.  

### Sprint Burndown widget

The Analytics-based Sprint Burndown widget provides an easy way to monitor progress for a team by showing work remaining for a given sprint. Work remaining is the vertical axis and time is the horizontal axis. You can define remaining work based on Stories or Tasks, and by counting the work items or summing a field. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sprint Burndown Widget - Sprint Burndown Example](media/sprint-burndown/sprint-burndown-widget.png)

The charts provide useful metrics to help you answer the question: *Are we on track to complete this set of work by the end a sprint?*
* Percentage work complete
* Number of work items not estimated (if using a field other than Remaining Work)
* Average burndown
* Total scope increase

### Sprint Burndown (Legacy) widget

The **Sprint Burndown (Legacy)** widget adds a chart based on Remaining Work defined for tasks in a team's current sprint. Select this version when you don't have access to Analytics. Configuration options include team selection, and widget size. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Sprint Burndown Legacy Widget - Sprint Burndown Example](media/burndown/sprint-burndown-legacy-devops.png)

If your dashboard already has a legacy version available, you can easily upgrade the widget by editing the widget's configuration, and checking **Try the new version now**. You can always go back to the legacy version by unchecking the box.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2020"

The **Sprint Burndown** widget adds a chart based on Remaining Work defined for tasks in the team's current sprint. There are no configuration options for this widget.

::: moniker-end

## Prerequisites  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/analytics-widgets-prerequisites.md)]

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019"

- You must be a member of a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md). 
- If you haven't been added as a project member, [get added now](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).  
- To add a widget to a team dashboard, you need to be a member of the team. You must have **Basic** access or greater, have [dashboard permissions](./dashboard-permissions.md), or be a [team admin](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md) or project admin.

::: moniker-end

## Team activities to track tasks and Remaining Work  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

To monitor sprint burndown, your team must [schedule sprints](../../boards/sprints/define-sprints.md) and [assign work to those sprints](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md).

If you want to monitor sprint burndown based on tasks and Remaining Work, your team must carry out these extra actions.  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"
To monitor sprint burndown, your team must [schedule sprints](../../boards/sprints/define-sprints.md) and [assign work to those sprints](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md). For sprint burndown charts to show meaningful data, your team must carry out these extra actions.  
::: moniker-end

### Required activities: 

*   [Define and estimate tasks](../../boards/sprints/add-tasks.md#define-tasks) for each product backlog item you're working on in the sprint. If you work from your team's backlog and taskboard, the items you create will automatically be assigned to the current sprint (Iteration) and to your team's default Area Path.  
*   [Update Remaining Work for each sprint task](../../boards/sprints/task-board.md#update-tasks) as work progresses.  

### Recommended activities:

*   Define tasks that take a day or less to complete to lessen the effect of poor estimates.  
*   Don't divide tasks into subtasks. If you divide a task into subtasks, specify hours only for the subtasks. These hours are rolled up as summary values for the parent task.   
*   Update Remaining Work daily or several times within a week to support monitoring and achieve a smoother burndown chart.  
*   At the end of the sprint, update the task status of completed tasks and determine how to handle incomplete tasks.  


<a id="empty-chart">  </a>

### Empty sprint burndown chart 

If your sprint burndown chart appears empty, check these points:
- Have you assigned tasks to the sprint associated with the chart?
- Have you assigned Remaining Work to the tasks assigned to the sprint? 
- Are the parent work items of the tasks assigned to the same sprint? If not, the tasks may appear in another sprint associated with the parent item. 

<a id="open-chart">  </a>

## Open a Sprint backlog

You view the in-context sprint burndown report from a team's Sprint backlog.

## View the in-context Burndown Trend report   

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

1. To open the Sprint burndown report, select **Analytics**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open Analytics](media/burndown/open-analytics.png)

1. Use the interactive controls to select from the following options:  

   1. The **Start Date** and **End Date** of the sprint. These dates will default to the team's current iteration sprint dates.   

   1. The **Backlogs/Work Items** to burn down on, either the product backlog&mdash;Stories, Issues, Product Backlog Items, or Requirements&mdash;or Tasks backlog to use. Your selection impacts the options available for the **Burndown on** menu.  

   1. The **Burndown on** field to use to calculate burndown, either a Count of Work Items or a sum of a field, such as Story Points, Effort, or Size.  

   1. Check or uncheck **Show non-working days**. Non-working days appear as gray bars in the background when enabled. Default non-working days are set for a team and for a team's sprint through the capacity page. See [Set working days](../../organizations/settings/set-working-days.md) and [Set sprint capacity](../../boards/sprints/set-capacity.md).  

      Select **Reset** to reset the controls to the default options. By default, the dates are set to the selected sprint. Changes to the start and end dates don't change any sprint date definitions. 

1. If you don't track Remaining Work in tasks, you can view burndown based on a count of work items/tasks. Hover over any point on the chart to show a summary of the data for a specific day.

### [Sum of Remaining Work](#tab/remaining-work)

When you choose to view the **Tasks backlog** and **Sum of Remaining Work**, the blue area shows the sum of Remaining Work per day for those tasks that are still active or in progress. As the Remaining Work is updated, the chart indicates the rate of burndown. The **Scope** trend line indicates the addition of Remaining Work after the start of the sprint. The **Ideal** trend line indicates the ideal burndown rate for the sprint. **Capacity** lines are only shown when the team has configured capacity.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Burndown trend based on Remaining Work](media/burndown/analytics-burndown-remaining-work-s159.png)

### [Count of Work Items](#tab/work-items)

When you choose to view the **Count of Work Items**, the blue area shows the count of work items&mdash;could be stories/backlog items/requirements or tasks depending on the backlog selected&mdash;which are still active or in progress. The **Scope** trend line indicates when new work items are added after the start of the sprint. The **Ideal** trend line indicates the ideal burndown rate for the sprint. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Burndown trend based on Count of Work Items](media/burndown/analytics-burndown-count-of-work-items-s159.png)


### [Sum of Story Points](#tab/story-points)

When you choose to view the **Stories backlog** and **Sum of Story Points**, the blue area shows the sum of Story Points for all User Stories that are still active or in progress. The **Scope** trend line indicates when Story Points are added after the start of the sprint. The **Ideal** trend line indicates the ideal burndown rate for the sprint.   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Burndown trend based on Story Points](media/burndown/analytics-burndown-story-points.png)

* * *

> [!NOTE]  
> The options for the sum fields depend on the numeric fields defined for task and requirement category work item types. The most common fields used to show the burndown trend are: 
> - Count of work items  
> - Sum of [Story Points, Effort, or Size](../../boards/queries/query-numeric.md#fields) 
> - Sum of [Remaining Work](../../boards/queries/query-numeric.md#fields). 

The selections you make are only set for you, and persist across sessions until you change them.

Teams may find it useful to review these reports periodically during their sprint retrospectives. It may spark useful discussions and lead to setting one or more sprint goals, such as: 
*   How does our projected velocity match up to our actual velocity? 
*   How can we more accurately determine how much we can accomplish in a sprint? 
*   How can we complete work at a more regular pace throughout the sprint?

In addition to the sprint burndown chart, teams can review the [velocity](team-velocity.md) at which they work sprint over sprint. The velocity chart tracks how many backlog items your team works on in a sprint. You can use your team velocity as input into the [forecast](../../boards/sprints/forecast.md) tool to help plan your sprints.
