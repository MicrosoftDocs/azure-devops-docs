# Widget catalog 
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)] 

Widgets display information and charts on dashboards. Many of them are configurable and display information available from one or more data stores or charts maintained within the system. 

To add a widget to a dashboard or copy a widget from one dashboard to another, see [Add a widget to a dashboard](add-widget-to-dashboard.md).    

The following widgets are organized under the service they support. Widgets that derive their data from the [Analytics service](../powerbi/what-is-analytics.md) are annotated with **Analytics**.  <!--- Team-scoped widgets display data based on the selected team context. User-focused widgets display information based on the logged-in user. -->

From the configuration dialog, select the build or release whose test results you'd like to monitor. There are multiple chart options to choose from (Line, Column & Stacked Column) based on your preference. Optionally you can map the trend of test duration on the existing chart by adding a secondary line chart. 

The widget provides the basic trend of the test results. To get deeper insights and higher configurability view [Test Analytics](../../pipelines/test/test-analytics.md)

<!--- QUESTION - Is this available on 2019? --> 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Test results trend widget](_img/widget-test-results-trend-advanced.png)

<!---
> [!NOTE]   
> **Feature availability:** The Test Results Trend (Advanced) widget is only available for an Azure DevOps Services organization that has the [Analytics Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-analytics) installed. 
-->

The Test Results Trend (Advanced) widget provides near real-time visibility into test data for multiple builds and releases. The widget shows a trend of your test results for selected pipelines. You can use it to track the daily count of test, pass rate, and test duration. Tracking test quality over time and improving test collateral is key to maintaining a healthy DevOps pipeline.

The widget supports tracking advanced metrics for one or more build pipelines or release pipelines. The widget also allows filtering of test results by outcome, stacking metrics, and more. 

To learn more, see [Configure the Test Results Trend (Advanced) widget](./configure-test-results-trend.md).

> [!NOTE]

### Team room  

![Team room widget](_img/widget-team-room.png)

Provides status and access to [team rooms](../../notifications/collaborate-in-a-team-room.md). Available for TFS 2015.1 through TFS 2017.2 versions.  
  
Team rooms support increased team productivity by providing a space to discuss work in progress, ask questions, share status, and clarify issues that arise. Team administrators can create additional team rooms.  

> [!NOTE]  
> Team Rooms have been deprecated as described in [Deprecation of Team Rooms](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/01/04/deprecation-of-the-team-rooms-in-team-services-and-tfs/) blog post. Several good solutions are available that integrate well with TFS that support notifications and chat, such as [Microsoft Teams](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsts.vss-services-teams) and [Slack](../../service-hooks/services/slack.md).

## Marketplace widgets

You may find additional widgets of interest from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=webpage%20widget&target=VSTS&sortBy=Relevance).  

If your organization owner or project collection administrator disables a marketplace widget, you'll see the following image: 

<img src="_img/widget-catalog-disabled-widget.png" alt="Disabled widget extension notification" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />   

To regain access to it, request your admin to reinstate or reinstall the widget. 

## Extensibility 

Using the REST API service, you can [create a dashboard widget](../../extend/develop/add-dashboard-widget.md). To learn more about the REST APIs for dashboards and widgets, see [Dashboards (API)](/rest/api/azure/devops/dashboard/dashboards).
