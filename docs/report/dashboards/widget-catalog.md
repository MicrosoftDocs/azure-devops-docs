# Out Of Box widget catalog

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Widgets display information and charts on dashboards. Many widgets are configurable or are scoped to a team or to the logged in user account. Many display information available from one or more data stores or charts maintained within the system. You add a widget to a dashboard or copy a widget from one dashboard to another. For more information, see [Add a widget to a dashboard](add-widget-to-dashboard.md).

For example, you can add the **Build History** widget from the dashboard's **Add Widget** dialog.

:::image type="content" source="media/widget-build-history-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Build History Widget which includes an icon and description.":::

This article provides a quick reference of all out of box (OOB) widgets that you can add to your dashboard. In addition to these widgets, you might find more widgets in the [Marketplace](#marketplace) or create your own.

## Supported OOB widgets

Widgets listed in the following table are provided out-of-box. They're organized under the service they support:

- **Analytics**: Widget derives data from [Analytics data](../powerbi/what-is-analytics.md)  
- **Build**: Widget derives data for a selected build pipeline  
- **Project**: Widget where you can select the project and team when configuring the widget
- **Release**: Widget derives data for a selected release pipeline  
- **Team**: Widget is scoped to a single team  
- **Teams**: Widget is scoped to one or more teams
- **User**: Widget is scoped to the logged in user account

## Azure Test Plans widgets

Add test tracking widgets to your dashboards to show status, progress, or trends of your testing efforts. In addition to the widgets listed here, you can add test tracking charts to your dashboard. For more information, see [Track test status](../../test/track-test-status.md).

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      ### Chart for Test Plans  
      :::image type="icon" source="media/widget-chart-test-plans.png":::
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
      <br/>
      <a id="chart-test-plan-widget"></a> 
      A configurable widget that lets you track the progress of test case authoring or status of test execution for tests in a test plan. Get started by selecting a test plan and a test suite. Then select test case chart for test authoring progress or test results for test execution progress. Finally, select the chart type and the pivots.

      For more information, see [Track your test results](../../test/track-test-status.md).
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      ### Test Results Trend
      :::image type="icon" source="media/widget-test-results-trend.png":::
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
      <br/>
      <a id="test-trend-results"></a> <a id="test-results-widget"></a>
      A configurable tile that displays the trend of test results for the selected build or release pipeline. The widget helps you visualize the test trends over a period of time. The widget surfaces patterns about test failures, test duration, and others.

      From the configuration dialog, select the build or release whose test results to monitor. There are multiple chart options to choose from, such as Line, Column, and Stacked Column, based on your preference.

      The Test Results Trend (Advanced) widget provides near real-time visibility into test data for multiple builds and releases. The widget shows a trend of your test results for selected pipelines. You can use it to track the daily count of test, pass rate, and test duration. Tracking test quality over time and improving test collateral is key to maintaining a healthy DevOps pipeline.  
      The widget supports tracking advanced metrics for one or more build pipelines or release pipelines. The widget also allows filtering of test results by outcome, stacking metrics, and more.

      For more information, see [Configure the Test Results Trend (Advanced) widget](./configure-test-results-trend.md).
