##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team room  

![Team room widget](_img/widget-team-room.png)

Provides status and access to [team rooms](../../collaborate/collaborate-in-a-team-room.md). Available for TFS 2015.1 through TFS 2017.2 versions.  
  
Team rooms support increased team productivity by providing a space to discuss work in progress, ask questions, share status, and clarify issues that arise. Team administrators can create additional team rooms.  

> [!NOTE]  
> **Feature availability:** Team Rooms have been deprecated as described in this blog post, [Deprecation of the Team Rooms in VSTS and TFS](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/01/04/deprecation-of-the-team-rooms-in-team-services-and-tfs/). Several good solutions are available that integrate well with TFS that support notifications and chat, such as [Microsoft Teams](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vsts.vss-services-teams) and [Slack](../../service-hooks/services/slack.md).

## Related notes

These represent the basic widgets. Look forward to more widgets becoming available in the coming months. 

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketplace widgets

You may find additional widgets of interest from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=webpage%20widget&target=VSTS&sortBy=Relevance).  

If your account or project collection administrator disables a marketplace widget, you'll see the following image: 

<img src="_img/widget-catalog-disabled-widget.png" alt="Disabled widget extension notification" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />   

To regain access to it, request your admin to reinstate or reinstall the widget. 

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensibility 

Using the REST API service, you can [create a dashboard widget](../../extend/develop/add-dashboard-widget.md). To learn more about the REST APIs for dashboards and widgets, see [Dashboards (API)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts/dashboard/dashboards).
