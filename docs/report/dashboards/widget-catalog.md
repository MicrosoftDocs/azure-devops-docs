# Out Of Box widget catalog 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 


Widgets display information and charts on dashboards. Many widgets are configurable or are scoped to a team or to the logged in user account. Many display information available from one or more data stores or charts maintained within the system. You add a widget to a dashboard or copy a widget from one dashboard to another. To learn how, see [Add a widget to a dashboard](add-widget-to-dashboard.md). 

For example, you can add the **Build History** widget from the dashboard's **Add widget** dialog. 

![Build history widget](media/widget-build-history-chart.png)   

This article provides a quick reference of all out of box (OOB) widgets that you can add to your dashboard. In addition to the OOB widgets, you may find more widgets in the [Marketplace](#marketplace) or create your own.

## Supported OOB widgets

Widgets listed in the following table are provided out-of-box. They're organized under the service they support. Widgets are annotated as follows: 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
- **Analytics**: Widget derives data from [Analytics data](../powerbi/what-is-analytics.md)  
- **Build**: Widget derives data for a selected build pipeline  
- **Project**: indicates you can select the project and team when configuring the widget
- **Release**: Widget derives data for a selected release pipeline  
- **Team**: Widget is scoped to a single team  
- **Teams**: Widget is scoped to one or more teams
- **User**: Widget is scoped to the logged in user account
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
- **Build**: Widget derives data for a selected build pipeline  
- **Release**: Widget derives data for a selected release pipeline

      <a id="deployment-status-widget"></a> 
      Configurable widget that shows a combined view of the deployment status and test pass rate across multiple environments for a recent set of builds. You configure the widget by specifying a build pipeline, branch, and linked release pipelines.  
      To view the test summary across multiple environments in a release, the widget provides a matrix view of each environment and corresponding test pass rate.   
      
      You can choose any cell to see a more [detailed view](../../pipelines/test/review-continuous-test-results-after-build.md) for the selected environment.

      Configurable widget that you can use to track quality continuously from a build or release pipeline. The widget shows the mapping between a requirement and latest test results executed against that requirement. It provides insights into requirements traceability. For example, requirements not meeting the quality, requirements not tested, and so on.

      <a id="chart-test-plan-widget"></a> 
      Adds a configurable widget that lets you track the progress of test case authoring or status of test execution for tests in a test plan. Get started by selecting a test plan and a test suite. Then select test case chart for test authoring progress or test results for test execution progress. Finally, select the chart type and the pivots.

      <a id="test-trend-results"></a> <a id="test-results-widget"></a>
      Adds a configurable tile that displays the trend of test results for the selected build or release pipeline. The widget helps you visualize the test trends over a period of time, thereby surfacing patterns about test failures, test duration etc.    
      
      From the configuration dialog, select the build or release whose test results you'd like to monitor. There are multiple chart options to choose from (Line, Column & Stacked Column) based on your preference. Optionally you can map the trend of test duration on the existing chart by adding a secondary line chart.

      <a id="test-trend-results-advanced"></a>
      The Test Results Trend (Advanced) widget provides near real-time visibility into test data for multiple builds and releases. The widget shows a trend of your test results for selected pipelines. You can use it to track the daily count of test, pass rate, and test duration. Tracking test quality over time and improving test collateral is key to maintaining a healthy DevOps pipeline.  
      The widget supports tracking advanced metrics for one or more build pipelines or release pipelines. The widget also allows filtering of test results by outcome, stacking metrics, and more.     
      
      To learn more, see [Configure the Test Results Trend (Advanced) widget](./configure-test-results-trend.md).
