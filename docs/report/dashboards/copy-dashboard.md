# Copy a dashboard 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2022](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2022.md)] 

You can create a new dashboard by copying the widgets from an existing one and adjusting them for a different team or project. This way, you donâ€™t have to start from scratch when you want to make a similar dashboard. To copy a dashboard, you begin with the source dashboard and then select the destination team and the destination project. The copied dashboard has the same widgets as the source dashboard, but you can configure them according to the team you chose.

To create a dashboard for a team or project, see [Add, rename, and delete dashboards](dashboards.md). To add a team or project, see [Add a team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md) or [Create a project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).

2. Enter a **Name** and **Description** for the new dashboard. Make sure you specify a unique name for the dashboard. To copy the dashboard as a team dashboard, select **Team Dashboard** and then select the **Project** and the **Team**. To copy the dashboard as a project dashboard, select **Project Dashboard** and then the **Project**. 

	Here we choose to copy the Fabrikam Fiber project - Fabrikam Team Bug Activity dashboard to the Design Agile project, Design Agile team dashboard. 


	:::image type="content" source="media/copy-dashboard/new-dashboard-dialog.png" alt-text="New dashboard dialog, copy dashboard for a different team.":::

	Check the **Select folder to copy dashboard queries** checkbox to choose the folder into which dashboard queries get copied. Make sure to select a folder where you have permissions to contribute queries. When you copy dashboards to a different project, this checkbox is automatically selected and requires you to select a folder in the project. 
  
3. Select **Create**.

	The page updates to reflect the new dashboard. The widgets and layout appear the same as the copied dashboard.  

	In the background, a folder with the name of the new dashboard gets created in **Shared Queries**. All the queries for the new dashboard get copied to that folder. Query names remain the same. Widgets with a team configuration get updated with the new team. Widgets with a team configuration that are copied from a team dashboard to a project dashboard retain the original configuration.

4. (Optional) Open each query and widget in the new dashboard, as needed, to verify or modify the name and configuration. Dashboard widget changes automatically update.
