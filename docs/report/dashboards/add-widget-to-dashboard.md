# Add widgets to a dashboard

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1**

Widgets smartly format data to provide access to easily consumable data. You add widgets to your team dashboards to gain visibility into the status and trends occurring as you develop your software project. 

Each widget provides access to a chart, user-configurable information, or a set of links that open a feature or function. 

You can add one or more charts or widgets to your dashboard. You add several widgets at a time simply by selecting each one. See [Manage dashboards](dashboards.md#manage) to determine the permissions you need to add and remove widgets from a dashboard.

## Connect to the web portal for your team project 

To add a widget to a dashboard, you connect to your team project using a [supported web browser](/tfs/server/compatibility#supported-browsers).  If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [VSTS](../../accounts/create-account-msa-or-work-student.md)<!--- or set one up in an [on-premises TFS](../../accounts/create-team-project.md)-->.

Open a browser window and click the **Dashboards** hub. If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../../work/scale/multiple-teams.md#add-team-members).

![Open the Dashboards hub](_img/dashboards-go-to.png) 

If you don't see the team or team project you want, click the ![project icon](../../work/_img/icons/project-icon.png) project icon to [browse all team projects and teams](../../user-guide/account-home-pages.md).  

    
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"

## Select a dashboard to modify 

All dashboards are associated with a team. You need to be a team administrator, project administrator, or a team member with permissions to modify a dashboard. 

::: moniker-end

# [New Dashboards Experience](#tab/new-query-exp) 

::: moniker range="vsts"

To enable the New Dashboard experience, see [Enable preview features](../../collaborate/preview-features.md).  

1. From the **Dashboards** hub, open the selector and choose  the **Browse all dashboards** option. 
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Dashboards hub, Browse all dashboards option](_img/dashboards/browse-all-dashboards.png)  

2. The **All** page lists all dashboards defined for the team project in alphabetical order. You can filter the list by team or by keyword.   
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Dashboards hub, Browse all dashboards option](_img/dashboards/all-dashboards-list.png)  
   
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"
The New Dashboard experience is only available from VSTS at this time. 

::: moniker-end


# [Old Dashboards Experience](#tab/old-query-exp)

::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"

1. Select the team whose dashboards you want to view. To switch your team focus, see [Switch team project or team focus](../../settings/switch-team-context.md).

2. Click the **Dashboards** hub.

3. Click the name of the dashboard to modify it. 

	For example, here we choose to view the Work in Progress dashboard.

## Add a widget to a dashboard  


<!---
Widget images may vary depending on which platform you access. This topic shows images that appear in VSTS. However, the widget title and functionality described in this topic are valid for both VSTS and TFS. For example, dashboard edit mode controls shown below are valid for VSTS and TFS 2015.2 and later version. Some functionality differs when you connect to TFS 2015.1 or earlier versions.  
-->

 
# [New Dashboards Experience](#tab/new-query-exp) 

::: moniker range="vsts"

To enable the New Dashboard experience, see [Enable preview features](../../collaborate/preview-features.md).  

To add widgets to the dashboard, click ![Edit dashboard icon](_img/icons/edit-icon.png). 

The widget catalog will automatically open.  Add all the widgets that you want and drag their tiles into the sequence you want. 

When you're finished with your additions, click  **Done Editing** to exit dashboard editing. This will dismiss the widget catalog. You can then [configure the widgets](#configure) as needed.

> [!TIP]   
> When you're in dashboard edit mode, you can remove, rearrange, and configure widgets, as well as add new widgets. Once you leave edit mode, the widget tiles remain locked, reducing the chances of accidentally moving a widget.

To remove a widget, click the ![actions icon](../../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon and select the **Delete** option from the menu.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Delete a widget from a dashboard](_img/dashboards/delete-widget.png) 



::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"

The [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) describes all the available widgets, many of which are scoped to the selected team context.  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
Or, you can drag and drop a widget from the catalog onto the dashboard.

## Copy a widget to another dashboard

You can copy a widget to another dashboard defined for your team. If you want to move widgets you have configured to another dashboard, this is how you do it. Before you begin, add the dashboard you want to copy or move the widget to. Once you've copied the widget, you can delete it from the current dashboard.

## Analytics Service widgets 
The Analytics Service is in preview and provides access to several widgets. To learn more, see these topics: 
- [Widgets based on the Analytics Service](../analytics/analytics-widgets-vsts.md)

## Try this next 

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Review the widget catalog](widget-catalog.md)
> or
> [Review Marketplace widgets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=widget&target=VSTS&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance)


### Extensibility  
In addition to the widgets described in the Widget catalog, you can create your own widgets using the [Widget REST APIs](../../extend/develop/add-dashboard-widget.md). 

### Widget size

Some widgets are pre-sized and can't be changed. Others are configurable through their configuration dialog. 

For example, the Chart for work items widget allows you to select an area size ranging from 2 x 2  to 4 x 4 (tiles).  

<img src="_img/add-widget-size.png" alt="Change widget size" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  


### Disabled Marketplace widget 

If your account or project collection administrator disables a marketplace widget, you'll see the following image: 

<img src="_img/widget-catalog-disabled-widget.png" alt="Disabled widget extension notification" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />   

To regain access to it, request your admin to reinstate or reinstall the widget.
