# Default permissions and access for charts and dashboards   

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-azure-devops-all.md)]

Team members and members of the of the Contributors group for a project can view charts and dashboards. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. For a simplified view of all default permissions assigned to built-in groups, see [Default permissions and access](../../organizations/security/permissions-access.md).  

Stakeholders have limited access to view charts and dashboards. To learn more, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md).

For an overview of dashboard and chart features, see [Dashboards, charts, & widgets](overview.md).

## Dashboards, charts, reports, and widgets

You can define and manage dashboards from the web portal, **Dashboard**. For an overview of dashboard and chart features, see [About dashboards, charts, reports, and widgets](overview.md). You set [dashboard permissions at the team level](dashboard-permissions.md) from the team dashboard page.

## Power BI Integration and Analytics views

From the web portal **Analytics views**, you can create and manage Analytics views. An Analytics view provides a simplified way to specify the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on Analytics data. Analytics is the reporting platform for Azure DevOps. To learn more, see [What is Analytics?](../../report/powerbi/what-is-analytics.md). 

You set [permissions](../../report/powerbi/analytics-security.md) for the service at the project level, and for shared Analytics views at the object level. Users with **Stakeholder** access have no access to view or edit Analytics views.
