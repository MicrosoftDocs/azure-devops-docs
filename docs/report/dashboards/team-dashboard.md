# Pin items to a team dashboard

<b>TFS 2015 | TFS 2013</b>  

>[!NOTE]  
>**Feature availability:** For on-premises TFS, install TFS 2015 Update 1 to get access to [multiple team dashboards](dashboards.md) and [widgets](widget-catalog.md) that you can add to these dashboards.  Â 

Teams can view the progress of work from the team home page. Team administrators can add or pin items to this dashboard and re-sequence tiles. Each tile provides team members quick access to work items, build progress, code changes, and more.

From the web portal, you can view pinned items on the home page, including flat-list query charts.

If you need to add a team first, see [Multiple teams](../../work/scale/multiple-teams.md).

##Pin items to a dashboard 

You pin an item to the team dashboard from the code, work, and build pages.

1.  If you aren't a team administrator, [get added as one](../../work/scale/manage-team-assets.md).  

2.	Pin a work item query from its context menu.

	To add a source control folder or a build definition, open the corresponding page and access the pin feature in the same way.    

3.	To pin a chart, go to the query's Charts page and pin it to your selected dashboard or the team homepage.

5.	Click a tile or link to open it.
