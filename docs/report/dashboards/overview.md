# About dashboards, charts, reports, & widgets

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Gain visibility into your team's progress by adding one or more widgets or charts to your dashboard. Customizable, highly configurable dashboards provide you and your teams with the flexibility to share information, monitor progress and trends, and improve your workflow processes.  Each team can tailor their dashboards to share information and monitor their progress.  

If you're just starting out, read [Add, rename, and delete dashboards](dashboards.md). Looking for instructions on a specific task, in context chart, widget, or report? See [Dashboards and widgets quick reference](quick-ref.md). To learn about our reporting solutions, read [Reporting Roadmap](../powerbi/reporting-roadmap.md).

## Supported capabilities, permissions, and access

Access to Azure DevOps web portal features are managed through access levels assigned to users. 

### Web portal data views and reports

The following features provide support for viewing Azure DevOps data through the web portal:

- **Dashboards** are customizable interactive signboards that provide real-time information. Dashboards are associated with a team or a project and display configurable charts and widgets.
- **Charts** are query-based status or trend charts derived from a work item query or test results.
- **Widgets** display configurable information and charts on dashboards. The widget catalog provides brief descriptions of those widgets available to you. Also, you can add widgets provided through the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops). 
- **In-context reports** are system-generated charts that support specific services. Examples are team velocity, sprint burndown, and the Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD), and the Test Failures Report. These reports are displayed on the **Analytics** tab for a specific service and derive data from Analytics.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

### Power BI reports 

The following features provide support for viewing Azure DevOps data using Power BI:

- **Analytics views** provide a simplified way to specify the filter criteria for a Power BI report based on Analytics data for Azure Boards data. To learn more, see [What are Analytics views?](../powerbi/what-are-analytics-views.md).
- **Power BI reports** allow users to create rich, customized Power BI reports or other reports using OData queries of Analytics data and the returned JSON data. For on-premises Azure DevOps environments, project collections must be configured to support the Inherited process.

	> [!NOTE]  
	> OData (Open Data Protocol) is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming REST APIs. To learn more, see [OData documentation](/odata/).
::: moniker-end  


::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

### SQL Server reports 

SQL Server Reporting is the legacy reporting solution available with Azure DevOps Server 2020 and earlier versions. The following features provide support for viewing Azure DevOps data using SQL Server Reports and SQL Server Analysis Services.  

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019 < azure-devops-2022"
- **Excel status and trend reports** supports generating custom work tracking reports using Excel starting with a flat-list query. To learn more, see [Create status and trend reports from a work item query](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/create-status-and-trend-excel-reports).
- **SQL Server reports**: For project collections that support the On-premises XML process model, allow users access to out-of-the-box SQL Server reports and support to create customized SQL Reports or Excel reports. Doing so requires that the project is [configured to support SQL Server reporting](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/add-a-report-server).

### Default permissions

**Dashboards**

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
You can set [individual dashboard permissions](dashboard-permissions.md) to grant or restrict the ability to edit or delete dashboards.  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
You set [dashboard permissions at the team level](dashboard-permissions.md) for team dashboards. 
::: moniker-end

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../organizations/security/includes/report.md)]
 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 

**Power BI Integration and Analytics views**

You set [permissions](../powerbi/analytics-security.md) for the service at the project level, and for shared **Analytics views** at the object level.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../organizations/security/includes/analytics.md)]

::: moniker-end


## Configurable dashboards

With dashboards, you can configure an array of charts and widgets. 

Each team can [add and configure multiple dashboards](dashboards.md) to:
- Share information.
- View status, progress, and trends
- Access quick links and other functions.

Easily add and rearrange widgets on the dashboard to show recent changes made to view build status, bug trends, and more. 

![Example dashboard](media/dashboard-view-with-widgets.png)

#### Sequence for adding and customizing a dashboard

<em>Select a box below to open the corresponding article.</em> 

[![Add dashboard](media/gs-add-dashboard.png)](dashboards.md)[![Add widget](media/gs-add-widget.png)](add-widget-to-dashboard.md) 

<a id="monitor-progress">  </a>

## Charts: Work tracking status and trends 

With flat-list queries, you can create various charts to monitor status, progress, and trends. Before you monitor work progress and trends, you'll need to have [planned your project and made progress on work you're tracking](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md). 

You can open a shared query, create a chart, and add it to the dashboard. Once it's been added to the dashboard, you can change the **Chart for work items** widget configuration to resize or change the chart parameters. Or, from the dashboard, you can add a **Chart for work items** widget and choose a shared query and set the chart parameters. Chart types include status&mdash;pie, bar, column, stacked bar, and pivot&mdash;and trend&mdash;stacked area, line, and area&mdash;charts. 

For details, see: 
- [Define a query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md)
- [Track progress with status and trend query-based charts](charts.md)

## Charts: Manual testing progress, results, and trends  

The steps to creating charts that track manual testing progress and results are similar to the ones for tracking work. The starting point, however, begins with the test plan rather than a query. For example, you can find out how many test cases are ready to run, or how many tests are passing and failing in each test suite. And, just like work item query-based charts, you can add these charts to a dashboard. 
 
For details, see: 
- [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md)
- [Create manual test cases](../../test/create-test-cases.md)
- [Track test status charts](../../test/track-test-status.md#charts) 

**Sample light-weight test charts** 
  
![Web Team test plan is a chart that shows counts of test in various stages. Tests by Suite breaks down the same tests by test suite.](media/gs-monitor-test-charts.png)

## Widgets 

You add widgets to a dashboard to display a chart, information, or set of links. Most widgets are configurable. For a description of each supported widget for your platform and version, see the [Widget catalog](widget-catalog.md). Here are the widgets that support the indicated service. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/widgets-oob.md)]

## In-context reports: Work tracking 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

Azure Boards provides several in-context reports that derive from Analytics data. From your backlog or board, you can view the Cumulative Flow Diagram and team Velocity reports by selecting the **Analytics** tab. Each report provides interactive controls to provide each user the view of interest to them. From a Sprint backlog, you can view the sprint burndown trend. 

### Cumulative Flow Diagram 

Use the interactive controls to choose the time frame, swimlanes, and workflow states or Kanban board columns.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open CFD Analytics](media/cfd/analytics-cfd-azure-devops.png)

### Velocity 
Use the interactive controls to choose the count or sum field and number of iterations. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open Velocity Analytics](media/velocity/analytics-velocity-azure-devops.png)

### Sprint Burndown Trend 

Use the interactive controls to choose the start and end of the sprint and count or sum field to use in the burndown. If you don't track Remaining Work in tasks, you can view burndown based on a count of work items/tasks. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"

Azure Boards provides several in-context reports that derive from the work tracking data store. From your backlog or board, you can view the Cumulative Flow Diagram and team Velocity reports by choosing the miniature charts that appear on each page. From a Sprint backlog, you can view the sprint burndown.  

### Cumulative Flow Diagram 

The CFD report shows the count of work items in the backlog based on their state over time.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Opened CFD chart](media/cfd/data-store-cumulative-flow-opened.png)

### Velocity 

Velocity is based on the values entered for Effort, Story Points, or Size fields for work items that belong to the Requirement Category. 

![Web portal, Velocity chart showing seven sprints of in progress and completed work](media/team-velocity-chart-web-7-iterations.png)  


### Sprint burndown  

Each sprint provides access to two charts. The first [tracks capacity](../../boards/sprints/define-sprints.md) for the team, team activities&mdash;such as Development, Test, Design&mdash;and individual team members. The second tracks the [sprint burndown](configure-sprint-burndown.md) for remaining work.
