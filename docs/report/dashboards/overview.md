# About dashboards, charts, reports, & widgets   

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-azure-devops-all.md)]

Gain visibility into your team's progress by adding one or more widgets or charts to your dashboard. Customizable, highly-configurable dashboards provide you and your teams with the flexibility to share information, monitor progress and trends, and improve your workflow processes.  Each team can tailor their dashboards to share information and monitor their progress.  

If you're just starting out, read [Add, rename, and delete dashboards](dashboards.md). If you're looking for instructions on a specific task, in context chart, widget, or report&mdash;review [Dashboards and widgets quick reference](quick-ref.md). To learn about our reporting solutions, read [Reporting Roadmap](../powerbi/reporting-roadmap.md).

## Key concepts

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

- <strong>Dashboards</strong> are customizable interactive signboards that provide real-time information. Dashboards are associated with a team or a project and display configurable charts and widgets.
- <strong>Charts</strong> are query-based status or trend charts derived from a work item query or test results.
- <strong>Widgets</strong> display configurable information and charts on dashboards. The widget catalog provides brief descriptions of those widgets available to you. In addition, you can add widgets provided through the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops). 
- <strong>In-context reports</strong> are system-generated charts that support specific services. Examples are team velocity, sprint burndown, and the Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD), and the Test Failures Report. These reports are displayed on the **Analytics** tab for a specific service and derive data from Analytics.  
- <strong>Power BI reports</strong> allow users to create rich, customized Power BI reports or other reports using OData queries of Analytics data and the returned JSON data.

## Configurable dashboards

With dashboards, you can configure an array of charts and widgets. 

Each team can [add and configure multiple dashboards](dashboards.md) to share information, view status, progress, and trends, and access quick links and other functions. Easily add and rearrange widgets on the dashboard to show recent changes made to view build status, bug trends, and more. 

![Example dashboard](media/dashboard-view-with-widgets.png)

## Charts: Work tracking status and trends 

With flat-list queries, you can create various charts to monitor status, progress, and trends. Prior to monitoring work progress and trends, you'll need to have [planned your project and made progress on work you're tracking](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md). 

You can open a shared query, create a chart and add it to the dashboard. Once it's been added to the dashboard, you can change the **Chart for work items** widget configuration to resize or change the chart parameters. Or, from the dashboard, you can add a **Chart for work items** widget and choose a shared query and set the chart parameters. Chart types include status&mdash;pie, bar, column, stacked bar, and pivot&mdash;and trend&mdash;stacked area, line, and area&mdash;charts. 

For details, see: 
- [Define a query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md)
- [Track progress with status and trend query-based charts](charts.md)

## Charts: Manual testing progress, results, and trends  

The steps to creating charts that track manual testing progress and results are similar to those for tracking work. The starting point, however, begins with the test plan rather than a query. For example, you can find out how many test cases are ready to run, or how many tests are passing and failing in each test suite. And, just like work item query-based charts, you can add these charts to a dashboard. 
 
For details, see: 
- [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md)
- [Create manual test cases](../../test/create-test-cases.md)
- [Track test status charts](../../test/track-test-status.md#charts)

## In-context reports: Work tracking 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

Azure Boards provides several in-context reports that derive from Analytics data. From your backlog or board, you can view the Cumulative Flow Diagram and team Velocity reports by selecting the **Analytics** tab. Each report provides interactive controls to provide each user the view of interest to them. From a Sprint backlog, you can view the sprint burndown trend. 

### Cumulative Flow Diagram 

Use the interactive controls to choose the time frame, swimlanes, and workflow states or Kanban board columns.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open CFD Analytics](media/cfd/analytics-cfd-azure-devops.png)

### Velocity 
Use the interactive controls to choose the count or sum field and number of iterations. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open Velocity Analytics](media/velocity/analytics-velocity-azure-devops.png)

### Sprint Burndown Trend 

Use the interactive controls to choose the start and end of the sprint and count or sum field to use in the burndown. If you don't track Remaining Work in tasks, you can view burndown based on a count of work items/tasks. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

Azure Boards provides several in-context reports that derive from the work tracking data store. From your backlog or board, you can view the Cumulative Flow Diagram and team Velocity reports by choosing the miniature charts that appear on each page. From a Sprint backlog, you can view the sprint burndown.  

### Cumulative Flow Diagram 

The CFD report shows the count of work items in the backlog based on their state over time.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Opened CFD chart](media/cfd/data-store-cumulative-flow-opened.png)

### Velocity 

Velocity is based on the values entered for Effort, Story Points, or Size fields for work items that belong to the Requirement Category. 

![Web portal, Velocity chart showing seven sprints of in progress and completed work](media/team-velocity-chart-web-7-iterations.png)  


### Sprint burndown  

Each sprint provides access to two charts. The first [tracks capacity](../../boards/sprints/define-sprints.md) for the team, team activities&mdash;such as Development, Test, Design&mdash;and individual team members. The second tracks the [sprint burndown](configure-sprint-burndown.md) in terms of remaining work.
