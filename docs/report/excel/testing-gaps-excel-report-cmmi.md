# Testing Gaps Excel Report (CMMI)
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-sharepoint-version.md)]

Teams who are responsible for testing software can use the Testing Gaps report to help determine where there are deficiencies in the test plans, test configurations, and test coverage. The Testing Gaps report provides the following five reports based on test results and builds that have been defined and run for a team project.  
  
-   **Requirement Status**: Helps the team identify gaps in test coverage for each requirement. This report requires that team members link test cases to requirements.  
  
-   **Requirement Status by Config**: Helps the team identify gaps in test coverage for each test configuration for each requirement. This report requires that team members link test cases to requirements.  
  
-   **Test Status by Area**: Helps the team identify gaps in test coverage of product areas. This report requires that team members assign test cases to product areas.  
  
-   **Tests Not Executed**: Helps the team identify test cases that have never been run for each test configuration.  
  
-   **Code Coverage**: Helps the team determine which builds and build assemblies have low or high code coverage.  
  
 The first four reports are available only when the team creates test plans and starts to run tests by using Microsoft Test Manager. For information about how to define test suites and test plans, see [Organizing Test Cases Using Test Suites](../../manual-test/getting-started/create-test-cases.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can access the Testing Gaps report from the **Test Team Management** folder that is located under the **Excel Reports** folder for the team project in Team Explorer. You can access this folder only if your team project portal has been enabled and is provisioned to use SharePoint Products. For more information, see [Configure or redirect process guidance](../sharepoint-dashboards/configure-or-redirect-process-guidance.md).  
  
 **Required Permissions**  
  
 To view the report, you must be assigned or belong to a group that has been assigned the **Read** permissions in SharePoint Products for the team project.  
  
 To modify or customize the report, you must be a member of the **TfsWarehouseDataReaders** security role in SQL Server Analysis Services. You must also be assigned or belong to a group that has been assigned the **Members** permissions in SharePoint Products for the team project. For more information, see [Grant Access to the Databases of the Data Warehouse for Team System](../admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).  
  
##  <a name="Data"></a> Data in the Reports  
 The Testing Gaps reports show the cumulative count of test results for the test plans, test configurations, and test cases that are defined for a team project. All reports are based on PivotTables that access data that is stored in the data warehouse.  
  
### Test Coverage of Requirements  
 The Requirement Status report indicates how many tests are passing or failing for each requirement. It provides a horizontal bar chart that shows the count of test results for each test case and test configuration combination that the team has defined for each requirement. The report presents the cumulative outcome of tests that were run for all test cases that are linked to requirements. The report displays results that are filtered by the following outcomes: **Passed** (green), **Failed** (red), **Never Run** (blue), or **Blocked** (yellow).

 The Requirement Status by Config report presents the test results for each requirement, grouped by test configuration.  
  
 The following table describes the report filters and fields that are used in the PivotTables that generate the reports that are focused on test coverage of requirements.  
  
|Filters|Fields|  
|-------------|------------|  
|-   **Team Project - Team Project Hierarchy**: Includes test results that are collected for the selected team project.<br />-   **Test Result - Iteration Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that are assigned to the selected iterations.<br />-   **Test Result - Area Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that are assigned to the selected product areas.<br />-   **Test Plan - Test Plan Name**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that belong to the selected test plans.<br />-   **Work Item Linked - Work Item Linked.Work Item Type**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that are linked to the selected work item type. The report only counts test results for test cases that are linked to a requirement.<br /><br /> **Filter specific to the Requirement Status by Config report**:<br /><br /> -   **Test Suite - Test Suite Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that belong to the selected test suites.|<ul><li>**Test Result- Outcome**: The outcome of the test. The report uses this field to define the column labels and to filter the test results to include Passed, Failed, Blocked, or Never Run.</li><li>**(Measure) Test - Point Count Trend**: Counts the most recent version of each test result in a particular build. If a test is run multiple times against a build, the Point Count Trend counts the most recent result for that test using that build.</li><li>**Work Item Link- Title**: The title of the work item that is linked to the test case. In this report, the title of the requirement is listed.</li><li>**Field specific to the Requirement Status by Config report**:<br /><br /> <ul><li>**Test Configuration - Configuration Name**: The name of the test configuration to list in the report.</li></ul></li></ul>|  
  
### Test Coverage by Product Area  
 The Test Status by Area report indicates how many test cases are passing or failing for a team project by product area. The following table describes the report filters and fields that are used in the PivotTables that generates the Test Status by Area report.  
  
|Filters|Fields|  
|-------------|------------|  
|-   **Team Project - Team Project Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were collected for the selected team project.<br />-   **Test Result - Iteration Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that were assigned to the selected iterations.<br />-   **Test Plan - Test Plan Name**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that belong to the selected test plans.|-   **Test Result- Outcome**: The outcome of the test. The report uses this field to define the column labels and to filter the test results to include Passed, Failed, Blocked, or Never Run.<br />-   **(Measure) Test - Point Count Trend**: Counts the most recent version of each test result in a particular build. If a test is run multiple times against a build, the Point Count Trend counts the most recent result for that test using that build.<br />-   **Test Result - Area Hierarchy**: The set of test results to include in the report based on the area paths that are assigned to the test cases that were run.|  
  
### Tests Cases That Have Never Run  
 The Tests Not Executed report indicates how many test cases have never run. The test cases are grouped by test configuration and test result owner. The following table describes the report filters and fields that are used in the PivotTables that generates the Test Status by Area report.  
  
|Filters|Fields|  
|-------------|------------|  
|-   **Team Project - Team Project Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were collected for the selected team project.<br />-   **Test Result - Iteration Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that were assigned to the selected iterations.<br />-   **Test Result - Area Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that were assigned to the selected product areas.<br />-   **Test Plan - Test Plan Name**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that belong to the selected test plans.<br />-   **Test Suite - Test Suite Hierarchy**: Includes test results that were run from test cases that belong to the selected test suites.<br />-   **Test Result- Outcome**: Includes test results with the selected outcome. The report uses this field to filter the count of test cases to include only those with an outcome of Never Run.|-   **(Measure) Test - Point Count Trend**: Counts the most recent version of each test result in a particular build. If a test case is not included in the build, it is counted as "Never Run."<br />-   **Test Configuration - Configuration Name**: The name of the test configuration to list in the report.<br />-   **Test Case- Title**: The title of the test case.<br />-   **Test Result - Owner**: The name of the team member who ran the test.|  
  
### Code Coverage  
 The Code Coverage report lists the lines of code that are covered, not covered, or only partially covered for each build and build assembly. You can use this report to determine which builds and assemblies have the lowest and highest code coverage. The following table describes the report filters and fields that are used in the PivotTable reports that generate the Code Coverage report.  
  
|Filters|Fields|  
|-------------|------------|  
|-   **Team Project - Team Project Hierarchy**: Includes builds that were defined for the selected team project.<br />-   **Build - Build Definition Name**: Includes builds that were associated with the selected build definitions.|-   **Build Coverage - Lines Covered**: The number of lines that were covered in the selected build.<br />-   **Build Coverage - Lines Not Covered**: The number of lines that were not covered in the selected build.<br />-   **Build Coverage - Lines Partially Covered**: The number of lines that were partially covered in the selected build. <br /><br />**Note:**      If multiple runs are performed against a build, the build coverage reflects the combined coverage of the runs, taking into consideration that there might be overlap in the lines covered across the runs.<br /><br />-   **Build - Build Name**: The name of the build. Each time that a build is run, it is assigned a name that contains the build definition name as its prefix.<br />-   **Assembly - Assembly**: The assembly name against which the coverage statistics were generated.|  
  
##  <a name="RequiredActivities"></a> Required Activities for Monitoring Testing Gaps  
 For the Testing Gaps reports to be useful and accurate, the team must perform the activities that are described in the following table:  
  
|Worksheet report|Required activities|  
|----------------------|-------------------------|  
|-   Requirement Status<br />-   Requirement Status by Config<br />-   Test Status by Area<br />-   Tests Not Executed|-   Define test cases and test plans, and assign test cases to the test plans. For more information, see [Defining a Test Plan](../../manual-test/getting-started/create-a-test-plan.md).<br />-   Run tests, and, for manual tests, [mark the results of each validation step in the test case as passed or failed](../../manual-test/getting-started/run-manual-tests.md).|  
|-   Requirement Status<br />-   Requirement Status by Config|-   Define requirements, and link test cases to requirements. The recommended link type to use is **Tested By**.|  
|-   Requirement Status by Config<br />-   Tests Not Executed|-   Define test configurations and assign to test plans or test suites. For more information, see [Test configurations: specifying test platforms](../../manual-test/test-different-configurations.md).|  
|-   Requirement Status<br />-   Requirement Status by Config<br />-   Test Status by Area<br />-   Tests Not Executed|-   (Optional) To support filtering, assign **Iteration** and **Area** paths to each test case. The **Test Result - Iteration Hierarchy** and **Test Result - Area Hierarchy** fields get their values from the **Iteration** and **Area** paths that are assigned to their corresponding test cases.|  
|-   Requirement Status<br />-   Requirement Status by Config<br />-   Test Status by Area<br />-   Tests Not Executed<br />-   Code Coverage|-   **Configure a build system**. To use Team Foundation Build, you must set up a build system.<br />     For more information, see [Configure Your Build System](../../build-release/overview.md).<br />-   **Create build definitions**. You can create several build definitions and then run each of them to produce code for a different platform. Also, you can run each build for a different configuration.<br />     For more information, see [Configure and manage your build system](../../build-release/overview.md).<br />-   **Define tests to run automatically as part of the build**. As part of the build definition, you can define tests to run as part of the build or to fail if the tests fail.<br />     For more information, see [Set up continuous testing for your builds](../../build-release/test/set-up-continuous-testing-builds.md).<br />-   **Configure tests to gather code coverage data**. For code coverage data to appear in the report, team members must instrument tests to gather that data.<br />-   **Run builds regularly**. You can run builds at set intervals or after every check-in. You can create regular builds when you use the schedule trigger.<br />     For more information, see [Build triggers](../../build-release/concepts/definitions/build/triggers.md).<br /><br />**Note:**      Although a team member can manually rate a build by using Build Explorer, this rating is not reflected in the Build Quality Indicators report. The build rating appears in the Build Summary report. For more information, see [Rate the quality of a completed build](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181734.aspx) and [Build Summary](../sql-reports/build-summary-report.md).|
