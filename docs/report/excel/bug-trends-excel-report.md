# Bug Trends Excel report

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-sharepoint-version.md)]

You can use the Bug Trends report in Office Excel to track the rate at which the team is discovering, resolving, and closing Bugs. This report shows a moving average of Bugs that the team has discovered and resolved over time. For information about how to access this report, see [Excel reports](excel-reports.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can view the Bugs Trends report from the Bugs dashboard. You can access this dashboard only if your team project portal has been enabled and is provisioned to use Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. For more information, see [Configure or redirect process guidance](../sharepoint-dashboards/configure-or-redirect-process-guidance.md).

##  Data in the report  

 You can use the Bug Trends report to understand the rate at which the team is finding, fixing, and closing Bugs. This report is based on a PivotChart report that shows the last four weeks of data captured for Bugs. That data is stored in the data warehouse.

 You should expect the Bug Trends report to vary based on where you are in your product development cycle. Early iterations should exhibit a gradual increase in the rate at which the team discovers bugs.  
  
 For information about healthy and unhealthy versions of the report, see [Bug Trends](../sql-reports/bug-trends-report.md).  
  
### Required activities for tracking bugs 
 
 For the Bug Trends report to be useful and accurate, the team must perform the following activities:  
  
-   Define Bugs, and specify their **Iteration** and **Area** paths.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For information about how to define area and iteration paths, see [Define area paths](../../organizations/settings/set-area-paths.md) or [Define iteration paths](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md) .  
  
-   Update the **State** of each Bug as it is fixed, verified, and closed.
