# Excel reports

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-sharepoint-version.md)]

You can use the Microsoft Excel reports to display information from the data warehouse for your team project. This topic describes reports that are provided with the [Agile](../../work/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md) process template. For a summary of reports provided with the CMMI process template, see [Excel reports (CMMI)](excel-reports-cmmi.md).

If you want to export work items to Excel, see [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel](../../work/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md). Or, if you want to create an Excel report from a query, see [Create Excel reports from a work item query](create-status-and-trend-excel-reports.md).  
 
> [!NOTE]
> These reports require your team project portal to be configured with SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition. Also, you can view these reports in your team project's [dashboards](../sharepoint-dashboards/project-portal-dashboards.md).  
>   
>  If the project collection where your team project is stored is provisioned with SQL Server Reporting Services, you can use Report Manager to view and filter the same information that the Excel reports provide. See [Reporting Services Reports](../sql-reports/reporting-services-reports.md).

## Excel Reports (TFS)  
You can track your team project's burn rate, bug backlog, software quality, test progress, and other metrics by viewing a [default Excel report](excel-reports.md).  

Here are examples of two of the Excel reports.

![Bug trends example report](_img/ALM_PG_Excel_BugTrends.png)   ![Build status example report](_img/ALM_PG_Excel_BuildStatus.png)

Default Excel reports require that your team project is configured with SharePoint Products and SQL Server Analysis Services. If these reports aren't available to you, you can [create ad-hoc reports in Excel from a work item query](create-status-and-trend-excel-reports.md) or by connecting to the Analysis Services cube.

<a name="RequiredPermissions"></a> 
###  Requirements and permissions  
 To access and use the Microsoft Excel reports, the following configurations must be met:  
  
-   To access an Excel report, your team project must have been provisioned with a project portal.  
  
     Excel reports are stored on the server that hosts SharePoint Products for your team project. If a project portal has not been enabled for your team project, you cannot access the workbook. For more information, see [Configure or add a project portal](../sharepoint-dashboards/configure-or-add-a-project-portal.md).  
  
-   To open a report in Excel that connects to the operational data store for Team Foundation, you must have the Team Foundation Office Integration add-in installed on your client computer. This add-in is installed when you install any version of Visual Studio or Team Explorer.  
  
 To view or modify an Excel report that is stored under the Documents node for a team project, you must be assigned or belong to a group that has been assigned **Read** permissions for Team Foundation. You must also have **Visitors** or **Members** permissions, respectively, in SharePoint Products for the team project.  
  
 In addition, all Excel reports that appear in the enterprise dashboards contain data from the Analysis Services cube. You can view enterprise dashboards only if the team project portal is hosted on a server that is running SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition.  
  
 To view, refresh, or create an Excel report from an enterprise dashboard, you must configure the SharePoint web application definition to either use Single Sign-On or Windows Authentication. The following restrictions apply based on the authentication service that you configure.  
  
 You must configure the SharePoint web application for Single Sign-On if you do not want to add users as members of the **TfsWarehouseDataReaders** security role in SQL Server Analysis Services. In addition, you must configure the application for Single Sign-on if the team project portal is configured to use NTLM authentication and is not installed on the data-tier server.  
  
-   **For Single Sign-On Authentication (Recommended)**  
  
     To authenticate viewers of enterprise dashboards by using Single Sign-On, you must perform the following actions:  
  
    -   You must configure the SharePoint web application to use Single Sign-on. For more information about how to configure Single Sign-on, see [Configure authentication infrastructure in SharePoint 2013](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj219795.aspx).  
  
    -   You must add dashboard viewers to a group that is granted access to the Single Sign-on enterprise application definition.  
  
-   **For Windows Authentication**  
  
     To authenticate viewers of enterprise dashboards by using Windows Authentication, you must perform the following actions:  
  
    -   You must either host the team project portal on the data-tier server, or you must configure the SharePoint web application to use Kerberos authentication.  
  
    -   You must add users as members of the **TfsWarehouseDataReaders** security role in SQL Server Analysis Services.  
  
 The following table summarizes the required permissions based on activity. For information about how to grant these permissions to team members, see [Add users to team projects](../../security/add-users-team-project.md). For information about permissions that are required to work with Excel reports in general, see [Grant permissions to view and manage reports](../admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).

For more information, see [Manage documents and document libraries](../sharepoint-dashboards/manage-documents-and-document-libraries.md).|  
  
### Refresh frequency  
 All data captured for work items is written to the WIT data store, but only select data is written to the Analysis Services data warehouse. The WIT data store is updated in real-time as team members create and modify work items. Incremental updates are then written to the relational warehouse database every two minutes and the OLAP cube every two hours. To change these settings, see [Change the Data Warehouse Refresh Frequency](../admin/change-a-process-control-setting.md).
