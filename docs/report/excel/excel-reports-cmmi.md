# Excel reports (CMMI)

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-sharepoint-version.md)]

You can use the Excel reports to display information from the data warehouse for your team project. this article describes reports that are provided with the [CMMI process template](../../boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md).  
  
If you want to export work items to Excel, see [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel](../../boards/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md). Or, if you want to create an Excel report from a query, see [Create Excel reports from a work item query](create-status-and-trend-excel-reports.md).  

> [!NOTE]
>  These reports require your team project portal to be configured with SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition. Also, you can view these reports in your team project's [portal dashboards](../sharepoint-dashboards/project-portal-dashboards.md).  
>   
>  If the project collection where your team project is stored is configured with SQL Server Reporting Services, you can use Report Manager to view and filter the same information that the Excel reports provide. See [Reporting Services Reports](../sql-reports/reporting-services-reports.md).  
  
 You can access the Microsoft Excel reports from the **Documents** folder  
  
## Requirements  
 To access and use the Microsoft Excel reports, the following configurations must be met:  
  
-   To access an Microsoft Excel report, your team project must have been configured with a project portal based on SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition.  
  
-   To open a report in Microsoft Excel that connects to the operational data store for Team Foundation, you must have the Team Foundation Office Integration add-in installed on your client computer. This add-in is installed when you install any product in Visual Studio ALM.  
  
 To view or modify an Excel report that is stored under the Documents node for a team project, you must be assigned or belong to a group that has been assigned **Read** permissions for Team Foundation. You must also be assigned the **Visitors** or **Members** permissions, respectively, in SharePoint Products for the team project.  
  
 In addition, all Microsoft Excel reports that appear in the enterprise dashboards contain data from the Analysis Services cube. You can view enterprise dashboards only if the team project portal is hosted on a server that is running SharePoint Server Enterprise Edition.  
  
 To view, refresh, or create an Excel report from an enterprise dashboard, you must configure the SharePoint web application definition to either use Single Sign-On or Windows Authentication. The following restrictions apply based on the authentication service that you configure.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  You must configure the SharePoint web application for Single Sign-On if you do not want to add users as members of the **TfsWarehouseDataReaders** security role in SQL Server Analysis Services. You must also configure the application for Single Sign-on if the team project portal is configured to use NTLM authentication and is not installed on the data-tier server.  
  
-   **For Single Sign-On Authentication (Recommended)**  
  
     To authenticate viewers of enterprise dashboards by using Single Sign-On, you must perform the following actions:  
  
    -   You must configure the SharePoint web application to use Single Sign-on. For more information about how to configure Single Sign-on, see [Configure authentication infrastructure in SharePoint 2013](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj219795.aspx).  
  
    -   You must add dashboard viewers to a group that is granted access to the Single Sign-on enterprise application definition.  
  
-   **For Windows Authentication**  
  
     To authenticate viewers of enterprise dashboards by using Windows Authentication, you must perform the following actions:  
  
    -   You must either host the team project portal on the data-tier server, or you must configure the SharePoint web application to use Kerberos authentication.  
  
    -   You must add users to the **TfsWarehouseDataReaders** security role in SQL Server Analysis Services.  
  
 The following table summarizes the required permissions based on activity. For information about how to grant these permissions to team members, see [Add users to team projects](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). For information about permissions that are required to work with Excel reports in general, see [Grant permissions to view and manage reports](../admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md).
