# Contact support

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2017-on](../includes/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]


If you've reviewed the troubleshooting sections and can't resolve your issue, consider [opening a  support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/devops/).


When you're contacting support for notification issues, it's good to have answers to the following questions:

1. What version or platform are you working from. If you don't know, review this section: [What platform or version am I using?](../user-guide/provide-feedback.md#what-platformversion-am-i-using).
2. When did you start noticing the problem?
2. What emails are you not getting that you expect?
3. Are you getting other types of emails?
4. Is it just you or are others also not getting emails they expect?
5. Can you supply IDs such as work item, build, or pull request IDs of recent events and an approximate time of the event?
6. Can you forward a sample email of a delayed or unexpected email? If not, copy and provide the URL from the View Result button on an email.

It's best to have a recent event reference for the notification in question. Full details about the event and notification delivery are retained for a few days and are beneficial for resolution. You might be asked to reproduce the issue with a new event and provide the following information:
- time/date of the event 
- IDs (build, pull request, etc.) associated with the event
