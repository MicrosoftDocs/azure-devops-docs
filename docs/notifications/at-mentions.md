# Use &#64;mentions in work items and pull requests

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)]

The **@mention** control allows you to quickly pull someone into a work item or pull request.

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]  
> The **@mention** control is available from TFS 2015 Update 2 and later versions.
::: moniker-end

<a id="mention-person-id">  </a>

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= azdevserver-2019"

For team members to receive notifications, [you must configure an SMTP server](/tfs/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts).

When you're leaving a code comment in a pull request, you can enter **@** to trigger the **@mention** identity picker. From the identity selector, you see a list of those people that you've recently mentioned. Choose one of those names or enter the name of the person you are looking for to perform a directory search.  

To filter the list, enter the user name or alias until you've found a match.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"
You can also use group mentions. Enter the name of a team or a security group, choose the search icon, and then select from the options listed.
::: moniker-end

To **@mention** a user you've never selected previously, just continue to enter the entire name to perform your search against the full directory.  

Names of those that you mention appear in <span style="color:#0099FF">blue text</span>. Choose the**@mention link name** to open the user's contact card, which can provide you additional context for why they were pulled into the conversation.

Upon completion of your selection and text entry, your **@mention** user receives an email alerting them about the mention.

Use the **@mention** control in pull request discussions, commit comments, changeset comments, and shelveset comments. You can also use the **@mention** control in any text field on the work item form.
