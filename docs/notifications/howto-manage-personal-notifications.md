# Manage your notifications

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2017-on](../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

As changes occur to your code base, builds, work items, and other operations, you can receive email notifications. For example, you can set an alert, so you're notified whenever a bug that you opened is resolved or you're assigned to a work item.

>[!NOTE]  
>This article applies to Azure DevOps Services, TFS 2017 Update 1, and later versions. If you work from an on-premises TFS 2017 or earlier versions, see [Set alerts, get notified when changes occur](../boards/queries/alerts-and-notifications.md). For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP server](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) for team members to see the Notifications option from their organization menu and to  receive notifications.



In this tutorial, you learn how to do the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * View your notifications
> * Add a custom subscription
> * Unsubscribe or opt out of a team or project subscription

## View your personal notifications

From the web portal, select the icon with your initials or picture, and then select **Notification settings** from the drop-down menu.
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
   ![Navigate to personal notifications page](_img/nav-personal-notifications-hub-newnav.png)  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
   ![Navigate to personal notifications page](_img/nav-personal-notifications-hub.png)  
::: moniker-end

## View all subscriptions

This view shows all subscriptions that you have created or that have been created by an administrator. Subscriptions let you control what you are notified about. Those notifications you're subscribed to are indicated with the State as **On**.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
<img src="_img/unsubscribe-personal-notifications-newnav.png" alt="Personal notification subscriptions" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
<img src="_img/unsubscribe-personal-notifications.png" alt="Personal notification subscriptions" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />  
::: moniker-end

A subscription can be just for you, or if you are a team admin, can be shared by everyone in the team.

## Add a custom subscription

With custom personal subscriptions, you can define precise criteria for the events you want to receive notifications for. In contrast to a default subscription, which only notifies the users or groups directly associated with an event, a custom subscription can notify you about any event.

1. From your Notifications page, select **New subscription**.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
   <img src="_img/manage-personal-notifications-new-subscription-newnav.png" alt="Open the new subscription dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
   <img src="_img/manage-personal-notifications-new-subscription.png" alt="Open the new subscription dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
::: moniker-end

1. Choose the category and template you want to use. For a list of supported templates, see [Default and supported notifications](oob-built-in-notifications.md).

	Here we choose to get notified when a pull request is created within a specific project, Fabrikam Fiber.

	<img src="_img/manage-personal-notifications-new-subscription-dialog.png" alt="New subscription dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

3. Modify the description to help you identify the subscription later. Also choose an email address for notifications to be delivered to. By default, your preferred email address is used. optionally, include one or more fields to further specify the event criteria.

	<img src="_img/manage-personal-notifications-complete-pull-request-subscription.png" alt="Updated subscription dialog with field criteria" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	> [!NOTE]   
	> The fields available for filtering event criteria differ depending on the category and template you select.   

4. Select **Finish** when you're done. The subscription now appears in the list under the category you selected.

	<img src="_img/manage-personal-notifications-subscription-added.png" alt="New subscription added" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

## Unsubscribe or opt out of a team or OOB subscription

You can choose to not receive notifications for certain team subscriptions by opting out of the subscription.

To unsubscribe from any notification, even one that you've defined, slide the State **On/Off** indicator to the Off position.
 
For example, here we turn off the Build completes subscription.

<img src="_img/unsubscribe-from-build-completes.png" alt="Unsubscribe from Build completes subscription" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

>[!NOTE]  
>Whether you are an administrator or not, toggling a shared team subscription from your notification settings only impacts you and not other team members.
