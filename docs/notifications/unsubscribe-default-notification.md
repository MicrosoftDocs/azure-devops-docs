# View your subscriptions, opt-out as needed 

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.1**

If you want to stop receiving select email notifications, you can do so by unsubscribing from them. For a description of each default subscription, see [Default notifications](oob-built-in-notifications.md)  

You start by opening your personal notification settings. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [VSTS](../accounts/set-up-vs.md).

1. From the web portal, click the icon with your initials or picture icon, and select **Notification settings** from the drop-down menu. 

	<img src="_img/unsubscribe-open-notification-settings.png" alt="Open personal notification settings" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	Those notifications you're subscribed to are indicated with the the State as **On**.  

	<img src="_img/unsubscribe-personal-notifications.png" alt="Personal notification subscriptions" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	The following image indicates a subscription is a default or Out-of-the-box (OOB) subscription: 

	![OOB notification](_img/oob-notification.png)

	You can't modify an OOB subscription, but you can view its definition from its context menu. 

2. To unsubscribe, slide the State **On/Off** indicator to the Off position. 
 
	For example, here we turn off the Build completes subscription.
