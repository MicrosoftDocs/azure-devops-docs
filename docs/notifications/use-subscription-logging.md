# How to enable subscription logging for troubleshooting

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

 For certain activities, when you select **Team members by role**, you can choose to have the user that initiated the activity receive a notification. This notification is controlled by the **Skip initiator** checkbox. By default, this box is checked, meaning the user that starts the change isn't notified about it.

Subscription logging is a valuable tool for troubleshooting.  It provides diagnostic information from the notifications pipeline and is disabled by default.  Once enabled, up to 25 logs, or one hour's worth of logs, are collected for the subscription.

## Enabling subscription logging

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> There's a known issue in TFS 2018 Update 2 and TFS 2018 Update 3, where enabling subscription logging for default ![globe](media/oob-notification.png) subscriptions may cause issues with notification delivery. If you're on one of those two versions, it's recommended that you not enable subscription logging for default subscriptions.

Complete the following steps to enable subscription logging:

1. Enable diagnostics for your organization by entering the following URL in your browser:

    `https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_notifications?diagnostics=true`

2. The option _Enable Diagnostics_ appears in the subscription context menu.

## View subscription diagnostic logs for event matching

Get all subscription event processing logs by entering the following URL in your browser:

`https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/notification/DiagnosticLogs/{event ID}/entries?startTime={date}&endTime={date}`

* _organization_ is your organization (for example, dev.azure.com/fabrikam-fiber)
* _date_ is a date time specification (for example, **2018-06-29** or **2018-06-29 02:00**)
* _event ID_ is **915f48f2-1b64-40d9-a43f-fe2528b4f296** for work item events, or
* _event ID_ is **9a688110-9e33-4cdc-affd-75d16303e7f1** for Git events, or
* _event ID_ is **a4804dcf-4bb6-4109-b61c-e59c2e8a9ff7** for any other event type

The result is JSON-formatted logging information.

## View subscription diagnostic logs for notification delivery
