# Navigating the notifications UI

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2017-on](../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

> [!NOTE]  
> This topic applies to Azure DevOps Services, TFS 2017 Update 1, and later versions. If you work from an on-premises TFS 2017 or earlier versions, see [Set alerts, get notified when changes occur](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md). For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP server](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) in order for team members to see the Notifications option from their organization menu and to receive notifications.

Learn about navigating the notifications user interface.
