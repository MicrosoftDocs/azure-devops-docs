# Manage your personal notifications

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../includes/version-all.md)]

You can manage your personal notifications in the following ways:

- View your notifications
- Set notifications just for yourself
- View and edit all notification subscriptions
- Add a custom notification subscription
- Unsubscribe or opt out of a team or project notification subscription

Personal notifications get sent to you in the form of an email as changes occur to builds, code, pipelines, work, artifacts, extensions, releases, and more.

For information about team and project-level notifications, see [Team and project-level notifications](about-notifications.md#team-and-project-level-notifications) and [Manage team or group notifications](manage-team-group-global-organization-notifications.md).

[!INCLUDE [note-earlier-tfs-version](includes/note-earlier-tfs-version.md)]

[!INCLUDE [note-smtp-server](includes/note-smtp-server.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

## Prerequisites

- Every user can manage their personal notifications
- See [about notifications](about-notifications.md)

## View your personal notifications

The following table shows notification event examples. For more information, see a full representation in [About notifications](about-notifications.md#team-and-project-level-notifications).

| Item                | Notification event examples |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Work item           | assigned, unassigned, comments                          |
| Code reviews        | updated, completed                                      |
| Pull request        | added or removed reviewer, completion failure, comments |
| Source control file | created, updated                                        |
| Build               | completion success, completion failure                  |

To access the Preview features options, open your profile menu. The profile menu appears, as shown, based on whether the **New Account Manager** feature is enabled.
#### [New Account Manager enabled](#tab/new-account-enabled)

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).

1. Select :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/user-settings-gear.png" border="false":::  **User settings**, and then select **Notifications** from the resulting list.

## Set personal alerts

In this context, an *alert* is effectively the same as a *notification*.

1. Open **My alerts** from your profile menu. If you don't see this option, then  [configure an SMTP server to support TFS](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts).

   ![Manage individual alerts from the web portal](media/set-alerts-from-profile-menu.png)

1. Enter one or more email addresses. Separate addresses with a semi-colon.

   ![Set email address for alerts](media/personal/ALM_AN_Email.png)  

1. Select the check box for each alert of interest. **My work items** and **My build** refer to work items and builds that you created.

   ![Manage TFS alerts](media/personal/ALM_AN_ManageAlerts.png)

   Alert templates reference a customizable query.

   The following alert types appear when your project is provisioned with Git for version control:  
   - A commit is pushed to this project
   - A pull request I've participated in is created or updated
   - A build quality changes

   > [!TIP]
   > When you clear an alert, you also clear all email addresses defined for the alert.  

   Open custom alerts for more options. Also, you can open a basic alert and modify its settings, such as change the email format from HTML to plain text or SOAP.

   ![Open custom alerts](media/personal/ALM_AN_CustomAlerts.png)

1. Define alert filters in the same way you define query filters.

   ![Fill out the custom alerts form](media/personal/ALM_AN_DefiningAlerts.png)

   For a list of available fields, see [Index of work item fields](../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).

1. For even more options, select **Others...**, and then choose **Select New Alert Template**.

   ![Open all alert options](media/personal/ALM_AN_Options.png)

1. Choose an alert type from the several alert types listed, and then select **OK**.

## View and edit all notification subscriptions

This view shows all notification subscriptions that you've created or that were created by an administrator. Notification subscriptions let you control what you get notified about. Subscribed notifications are indicated with the State as **On**.

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

To access the Preview features options, open your profile menu. The profile menu appears, as shown, based on whether the **New Account Manager** feature is enabled.

#### [New Account Manager enabled](#tab/new-account-enabled) 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Personal notification subscriptions, preview page.](media/unsubscribe-personal-notifications-preview.png)

#### [New Account Manager not enabled](#tab/new-account-not-enabled)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Personal notification subscriptions, current page.](media/unsubscribe-personal-notifications-newnav.png)

:::image type="content" source="media/unsubscribe-personal-notifications.png" alt-text="Screenshot of unsubscribe from notification subscriptions.":::

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"

A notification subscription can be just for you. Or, if you're a team administrator you can ensure that it's shared by everyone on the team.

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"

## Add a custom notification subscription

With custom personal notification subscriptions, you can define precise criteria for the events that you want to receive notifications. A custom notification subscription can notify you about any event. Default notification subscriptions differ, as they only notify users or groups directly associated with an event.

To access the Preview features options, open your profile menu. The profile menu appears, as shown, based on whether the **New Account Manager** feature is enabled.

#### [New Account Manager enabled](#tab/new-account-enabled)

1. From your **Notifications** page, select **New subscription**.
