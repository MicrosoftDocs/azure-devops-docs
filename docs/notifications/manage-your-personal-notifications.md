# Manage your personal notifications

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You can manage your personal notifications in the following ways:

- View your notifications
- Set notifications only for yourself
- View and edit all notification subscriptions
- Add a custom notification subscription
- Unsubscribe or opt out of a team or project notification subscription

Personal notifications get sent to you in the form of an email as changes occur to builds, code, pipelines, work, artifacts, extensions, releases, and more.

For information about team and project-level notifications, see [Team and project-level notifications](about-notifications.md#team-and-project-level-notifications) and [Manage team or group notifications](manage-team-group-global-organization-notifications.md).

[!INCLUDE [note-smtp-server](includes/note-smtp-server.md)]

## Prerequisites

- Every user can manage their personal notifications
- See [about notifications](about-notifications.md)

A notification subscription can be only for you. Or, if you're a team administrator you can ensure that it's shared by everyone on the team.

## Add a custom notification subscription

With custom personal notification subscriptions, you can define precise criteria for the events that you want to receive notifications. A custom notification subscription can notify you about any event. Default notification subscriptions differ, as they only notify users or groups directly associated with an event.
