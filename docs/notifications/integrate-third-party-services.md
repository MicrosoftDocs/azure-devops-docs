# Integrate third-party services

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2017-on](../includes/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

Integrate with your favorite services by notifying them when events happen in Azure DevOps. We have multiple [messaging app integrations](../service-hooks/services/workplace-messaging-apps.md) to help users receive notifications in response to events in Azure DevOps, complete workflows and take proactive actions such as allowing users to approve release deployments and creating work items from their channels.


See the following examples for specific service hook integrations:

* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Slack channel](../service-hooks/services/slack.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel](../service-hooks/services/teams.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a Trello board](../service-hooks/services/trello.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to a HipChat room](../service-hooks/overview.md)
* [Send Azure DevOps notifications to Azure Service Bus](../service-hooks/overview.md)

Or, integrate with any endpoint by [Sending Azure DevOps notifications to a generic WebHook](../service-hooks/services/webhooks.md). [Learn about all the integration options](../service-hooks/overview.md).
