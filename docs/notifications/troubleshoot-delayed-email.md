> This topic applies to Azure DevOps Services, TFS 2017 Update 1, and later versions. If you work from an on-premises TFS 2017 or earlier versions, see [Set alerts, get notified when changes occur](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md). For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP server](/tfs/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) in order for team members to see the Notifications option from their organization menu and to receive notifications.

Learn why you may not be receiving an expected notification email, and how to check the notification statistics.

Please perform the following step to determine if it resolves the issue.
