# Use #ID to link to work items  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)]

Use the **#ID** control to quickly link objects to work items. With this control, you can specify or select a work item ID and it is automatically linked to the object. 

Use the **#ID**control within the following areas:

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
- A work item discussion or any rich-text field
- A pull request discussion
- Commit comments
- Changeset or shelveset comments
- Wiki page. 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"
- A work item discussion 
- A pull request discussion
- Commit comments
- Changeset or shelveset comments
- Wiki page. 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 < tfs-2018"
- A work item discussion 
- A pull request discussion
- Commit comments
- Changeset or shelveset comments. 
::: moniker-end

<a id="mention-wit-id">  </a>

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"

## Link a pull request to a work item

When you are leaving a code comment in a pull request, you can enter **#** to trigger the **#ID** work item picker. The picker displays a list of 50 work items that you have recently modified or that are assigned to you.

You can narrow the list of suggested work items by entering keywords that match the work item type, ID, or title, or you can enter the exact work item ID.

<img src="_img/ALM_PRD_ID_PR.png" alt="Pull request comment area, type # to invoke work item control" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" /><br/>To further filter the list, continue to enter keywords until you&#39;ve found a match. You can enter up to five keywords.


## Link to work items in pull requests, comments, and commits

You can also use the **#ID** control in pull request discussions, commit comments, changeset comments, and shelveset comments.

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]  
> Requires TFS 2015 Update 2 or a later version.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

## Link to work items from a Wiki page

Use the **#ID** control to link to a work item from within a Wiki page.
