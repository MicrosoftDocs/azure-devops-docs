# Link to work items from other objects

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-ts-tfs-2015-2016.md)]

By linking to work items from other objects, such as builds, commits, pull requests, and more, you support your team's ability to maintain an audit trail of related work. All users can add links to their work items.

You can enter `#ID` from within the following areas to link to your work items:

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"
- A work item discussion or any rich-text field
- Git commit comments and pull request descriptions
- TFVC changeset or shelveset comments
- Wiki pages
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"
- A work item discussion 
- Git commit comments and pull request descriptions
- TFVC changeset or shelveset comments
::: moniker-end
 
> [!TIP]
> You can set up automatic linking and other settings that link work items to Git commits, pull requests, builds, and more. To learn how, see the following resources:   
> - [Configure repositories and branches to integrate with work tracking](../repos/git/configure-repos-work-tracking.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/breadcrumb/toc.json)
> - [Configure pipelines to support work tracking](../pipelines/integrations/configure-pipelines-work-tracking.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/breadcrumb/toc.json)
> - [Link and view work items to builds and deployments](../boards/work-items/work-item-deployments-control.md).


## Supported link types to devops objects 
 
The link types used to link work items to devops objects&mdash;as illustrated in the following image&mdash;are *Build*, *Found in build*, *Integrated in build*, *Integrated in release*  for build and release pipelines; *Branch*, *Commit*, *Pull Request*, and *Tag* for Git repositories, and *Changeset*, *Shelveset* and *VersionedItem* for Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repositories. These are all designated as external link types.

:::image type="content" source="media/add-link/conceptual-link-types-devops-objects.png" alt-text="Conceptual image of link types used to link work items to devops objects.":::
 
From the work item form, **Links** tab, you can [view all the objects linked to the work item](#view-list-links) as described later in this article. However, you can't create a work item query to list those links. Work item queries only return work items that are linked to other work items. However, you can create a query that lists work items that contain external links. To learn how, see [Query by link or attachment count](../boards/queries/linking-attachments.md).



> [!NOTE]
> You can also link to work items from GitHub commits, pull requests, and issues. This requires connecting your Azure DevOps project to your GitHub repository. To learn more, see [Azure Boards-GitHub integration](../boards/github/index.md).

## Link to work items from pull requests, commits, and comments

1. Enter `#` to trigger the `#ID` work item picker in your pull request commits, commit comments, changeset comments, shelveset comments, description, and more. You see a list of 50 work items that you've recently modified or that are assigned to you.

   :::image type="content" source="media/link-pr-to-work-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of work item list produced when entering # in PR description.":::

2. Narrow the list of suggested work items by entering keywords that match the work item type, ID, or title.

   :::image type="content" source="media/keyword-pr-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot of entering keyword after # and resulting work item in search":::

   To further filter the list, continue to enter keywords until you find a match. You can enter up to five keywords.

## Set work item state in pull request

::: moniker-end

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/set-work-item-state-pull-request.md)]

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

### How it works

The system considers the following three different criteria (in this order) when attempting to set the state of #mentioned work items: 
- State
- State Category
- keyword

#### Criteria logic

The following table describes the logic.

| **Criteria**                                      | **Action**                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **If** the value matches a state,               | **Then** set it to that state.                                                                                  |
| **Else If** the value matches a state category, | **Then** set the work item to first state in that category. See the following [note](#note-category-matching). |
| **Else If** the value matches a keyword,        | **Then** set the work item to matching keyword state. See the following [table](#keyword-action-table).        |
| **Else**                                       | Ignore it and do nothing.                                                                                       |

#### Keyword logic

Keyword logic helps with intent matching. For example, you might enter “Resolves”, but you really meant “Resolved”. 

<a id="keyword-action-table">  </a>

| **Keyword**                    | **Action**                                               |  
|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| Proposed, Proposes, Propose    | Set to the first state in the Proposed category.          |  
| InProgress                     | Set to the first state in the In Progress category.       |
| Completed, Completes, Complete | Set to the first state in the Completed category.         |
| Resolved, Resolves, Resolve    | Set to the first state in the Resolved category.          |
| Fixes, Fixed, Fix              | Close work item. Except Bug, which gets set to Resolved. |

<a id="note-category-matching">  </a>

> [!NOTE]  
> Category matching isn't supported on projects using a Hosted XML process. Category matching is only available for projects using an inherited process.

## Link to work items from a Wiki page

Enter `#` to trigger the `#ID` work item picker from within a Wiki page.

For more information about the built-in wiki, see [Add & edit wiki pages](../project/wiki/add-edit-wiki.md) and [Wiki markdown guidance](../project/wiki/wiki-markdown-guidance.md).

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
You can also you link a query results table to a wiki. This supports quick access to each linked work item in the query. For more information, see [Wiki markdown guidance](../project/wiki/wiki-markdown-guidance.md#link-to-work-items-from-a-wiki-page).
