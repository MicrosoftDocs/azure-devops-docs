# Auto detect configuration and git aliases

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)] 

The Azure DevOps Extension has been optimized for Azure Repos to work well with git workflows.

The Azure DevOps Extension evaluates if your current working directory is an Azure Repos git repository to auto detect configuration setting - organization, project and repository. This is achieved using the `detect` flag which is ON by default.

If you are working in a local check out of a repository, you can simply run `az repos pr list` from the local directory to view all PRs.

You can also configure the Azure DevOps Extension to add git aliases for common git-based Azure Repos commands like creating or adding reviewers to pull requests. This can be enabled by running the following command:


```bash
az devops configure --use-git-aliases true
```

This will alias all `az repos` commands to `git repo` and all `az repos pr` commands to `git pr`.
So `az repos list` becomes `git repo list` and `az repos pr list` becomes `git pr list`

For example, a pull request can now be created using the following command:


```bash
git pr create --target-branch {branch\_name}
```
## Parameter detection hierarcy

There are three main ways by which parameters can be provided to a command and they have been listed in order of priority:
1. Command parameters
For example: 
`az repos list --organization https://dev.azure.com/contoso --project webApplication`
2. Auto detection from git context if --detect is on. Detect is on by default. 
3. Default configuration
For example: 
`az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/contoso project=webApplication`

Say a customer runs the following commands
```
~/$ az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/contoso project=webApp
~/$ az repos list --organization=https://dev.azure.com/contosoTest --project=testApplication
````

In this case, the organization and project parameters are provided via defaults and via command parameters. As per the hierarchy, the command parameters are given top priority and will be used for the command run.

Let's have a look another example. Say a user user has pre-configured the default organization to `contoso` and project to `webApp`. However, the user is working out of a local checkout of a git repo which is in the `contosoTest` organization and `testApplication` project. Further, `--detect` is `ON` by default. 

```
~/contosoTest/portal$ az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/contoso project=webApp
~/contosoTest/portal$ az repos list
```

In this case, the `contosoTest` and `testApplication` will be auto detected as the target organization and project in the command and will override the defaults that have been set.
