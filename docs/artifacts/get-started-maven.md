# Get started with Maven packages and Azure Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This quickstart will guide you through setting up your Maven project to connect to Azure Artifacts feeds and publish and download your Maven packages.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization. [Create an organization](../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md), if you don't have one already.
- [Install Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- An Azure Artifacts feed. [Create a feed](./concepts/feeds.md#create-public-feeds.) if you don't have one already.

## Set up authentication

[!INCLUDE [](includes/maven/pom-and-settings.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you are using [Maven task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/maven-v3), set the `mavenAuthenticateFeed` argument to true to automatically authenticate with your Maven feed.

## Publish artifacts

[!INCLUDE [](includes/maven/publish.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization is using a firewall or a proxy server, make sure you allow [Azure Artifacts Domain URLs and IP addresses](../organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url.md#azure-artifacts). 

## Install artifacts

[!INCLUDE [](includes/maven/install.md)]
