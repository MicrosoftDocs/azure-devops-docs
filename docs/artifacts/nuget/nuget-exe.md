# Connect to an Azure Artifacts feed (NuGet.exe)

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Azure Artifacts enables developers to download NuGet packages from various sources such as private feeds and public registries. You can publish packages to private feeds and control access, or create public feeds to share them openly. This article guides you through authenticating with to your Azure Artifacts feed.

## Prerequisites

| **Product**        | **Requirements**                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Azure DevOps**   | - An Azure DevOps [organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md).<br>- An Azure DevOps [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).<br> - An Azure Artifacts [feed](../get-started-nuget.md#create-feed).<br> - Download and install the [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider).<br> - Install the latest [NuGet version](https://www.nuget.org/downloads). |

## Project setup

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed from the dropdown menu.

1. Select **Connect to feed**, and then select **NuGet.exe** from the left.

1. Add a *nuget.config* file to your project, place it in the same folder as your *csproj* or *sln* file, and then paste the provided snippet into it. Your *nuget.config* file should resemble the following:

    - **Project-scoped feed**:
    
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <configuration>
          <packageSources>
            <clear />
            <add key="<SOURCE_NAME>" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/nuget/v3/index.json" />
          </packageSources>
        </configuration>
        ```
    
    - **Organization-scoped feed**:
    
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <configuration>
          <packageSources>
            <clear />
            <add key="<SOURCE_NAME>" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/nuget/v3/index.json" />
          </packageSources>
        </configuration>
        ```

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed from the dropdown menu.

1. Select **Connect to Feed**, and then select **NuGet.exe** from the left navigation pane.

1. Add a *nuget.config* file to your project, place it in the same folder as your *csproj* or *sln* file, and then paste the snippet provided in the **Project setup** section into your file.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider#azure-artifacts-credential-provider) requires NuGet version `4.8.0.5385` or higher. For optimal performance, Azure Artifacts recommends using NuGet version `5.5.x` or later, as it includes crucial bug fixes related to cancellations and timeouts.

## Legacy project setup

If you're using an older version of NuGet, follow the instructions below to connect to your feed:

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts** and then select your feed from the dropdown menu.

1. Select **Connect to feed**, and then select **NuGet.exe** from the left.

1. Copy your source URL from the **Project setup** section, and then replace `/v3/index.json` with `/v2`. Your updated source URL should look like one of the following:

    - **Project-scoped feed**:
    
        ```
        https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/nuget/v2
        ```
    
    - **Organization-scoped feed**:
    
        ```
        https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/nuget/v2
        ```

1. Create a [Personal Access Token](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md#create-a-pat), make sure you scope it to the right organization you want to access, and then select one of the following scopes based on your needs: **Packaging (read)**, **Packaging (read and write)**, or **Packaging (read, write, and manage)**.

1. Run the following command in a command prompt window to add your feed source to your *nuget.config* file:

    ```CLI
    nuget sources add -name <FEED_NAME> -source <SOURCE_URL> -username <ANY_STRING_BUT_NOT_NULL> -password <YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
    ```

1. If your organization is connected to Microsoft Entra ID, you must first authenticate with your AD credentials, and then add your personal access token using the *setapikey* command:

    ```CLI
    nuget sources add -name <FEED_NAME> -source <SOURCE_URL> -username <AZURE_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_USERNAME> -password <AZURE_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_PASSWORD>
    
    nuget setapikey <YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN> -source <SOURCE_URL> 
    ```

## Authenticate using Service Principals

To authenticate with an Azure Artifacts feed using a service principal, set the [ARTIFACTS_CREDENTIALPROVIDER_FEED_ENDPOINTS](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider/blob/master/README.md#environment-variables) environment variable as shown below. 

This specifies your feed URL, the service principal's application (client) ID, and either the subject name or the file path of the service principal certificate (only one of these two is required).

#### [Windows](#tab/windows/)

```powershell
$env:ARTIFACTS_CREDENTIALPROVIDER_FEED_ENDPOINTS = @'{
    "endpointCredentials": [
        {
            "endpoint": "<FEED_URL>",
            "clientId": "<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_APPLICATION_(CLIENT)_ID>",
            "clientCertificateSubjectName": "<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CERTIFICATE_NAME>",
            "clientCertificateFilePath": "<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CERTIFICATE_PATH>"
        }
    ]
}
'@
```

#### [Linux/macOS](#tab/linuxmac/)

```bash
export ARTIFACTS_CREDENTIALPROVIDER_FEED_ENDPOINTS='{
    "endpointCredentials": [
        {
            "endpoint": "<FEED_URL>",
            "clientId": "<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_APPLICATION_(CLIENT)_ID>",
            "clientCertificateSubjectName": "<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CERTIFICATE_NAME>",
            "clientCertificateFilePath": "<SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CERTIFICATE_PATH>"
        }
    ]
}'
```
