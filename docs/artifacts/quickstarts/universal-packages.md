# Publish and download universal packages with Azure CLI

With universal packages, you can store different types of packages other than the widely used ones such as NuGet, npm, Maven, or Python packages. Using Azure CLI, you can publish and download universal packages from the command line. Uploaded packages can vary in size (up to 4 TB), but should always have a name and a version number. This article will walk you through the steps to publish and download your universal packages to Azure Artifacts feeds.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
1. If you're using Linux, make sure you install the [.NET on Linux](/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites) version.
1. [Azure DevOps Services account](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/).
1. [Azure Artifacts feed](../get-started-nuget.md).

## Connection setup

1. To check the version of Azure CLI modules and extensions that you currently have, run the following command: 

   ```azurecli
   az --version
   ```

2. Install the Azure DevOps extension.

   ```azurecli
   az extension add --name azure-devops
   ```

3. If you already have the Azure DevOps extension but you want to update to the latest version, run the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az extension update --name azure-devops
   ```

4. Log in to Azure.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

> [!TIP]
> To access tenants without subscriptions, run `az login --allow-no-subscription`.

5. Set your project and organization as the CLI's default.

    ```azurecli
    az devops configure --defaults project=<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> organization=https://dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_NAME> 
    ```

## Publish universal packages

To publish a universal package, run the following command in an elevated command prompt. Package names must be lowercase, start and end with letters or numbers, and contain only letters, numbers, and non-consecutive dashes, underscores, and periods. Package versions must be lowercase without build metadata (+ suffix). See [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) to learn more about semantic versioning.

The following command will publish a universal package to an organization-scoped feed:

```azurecli
az artifacts universal publish --organization https://dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION> --feed <FEED_NAME> --name <PACKAGE_NAME> --version <PACKAGE_VERSION> --description <PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION> --path <PACKAGE_DIRECTORY>
```

## View published packages

1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps organization.

1. Select your project, and then select **Artifacts**.

1. Select your feed from the drop-down menu.

## Download universal packages

To download a universal package using Azure CLI, run the following command in an elevated command prompt.

```azurecli
az artifacts universal download --organization https://dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION> --feed <FEED_NAME>  --name <PACKAGE_NAME> --version <PACKAGE_VERSION> --path <DOWNLOAD_PATH>
```

## Download specific files

If you only want to download specific files, you can use the `--file-filter` parameter to download a subset of files.

Example: `--file-filter *logs/*.log` would match any file ending with *logs* and with the extension *.log* (Example: build123_logs.log). See [File matching patterns reference](../../pipelines/tasks/file-matching-patterns.md) for more details.

```azurecli
az artifacts universal download --organization https://dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION> --feed <FEED_NAME> --name <PACKAGE_NAME> --version <PACKAGE_VERSION>  --path <DOWNLOAD_PATH>  --file-filter <MATCH_PATTERN>
```

## Download the latest version

You can use wildcards to download the latest version of your Universal Packages.

**Examples**:

- `--version '*'`: the latest version.

- `--version '1.*'`: the latest version with major 1.

- `--version '1.2.*'`: the latest patch release with major 1 and minor 2.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Wildcard patterns are not supported with pre-release versions (packages with a dash in their version number).
