# Azure Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]  

With Azure Artifacts you can create and share Maven, npm, and NuGet package feeds from public and private sources with teams of any size. You can 
add fully integrated package management to your continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines with a single click.  

Azure Artifacts is an extension to Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server. It comes pre-installed in Azure DevOps Services, Azure DevOps Server 2019, and Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2017 and 2018.
