# Constructing a complete package graph

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

When you release a package, it's important to ensure that all the package dependencies are also available. Azure Artifacts recommend using [upstream sources](upstream-sources.md) to publish and consume package dependencies. When a package is consumed from an upstream source for the first time, a copy of that package is saved in the feed, so even if the upstream source goes down, your copy will remain available to you and your customers.

## How upstream sources construct the set of available packages

Because Azure Artifacts feeds can have other feeds as upstream sources, it seems possible on the surface to have a cycle of upstream sources, where feed A upstreams to feed B, which upstreams to feed C, which upstreams back to feed A. Left unchecked, such a cycle could break package requests by creating an infinite loop where a user asks A for a package, then A asks B, then B asks C, then C asks A again, etc. Upstream sources are designed to prevent this failure.

When a feed consults its upstream sources for a package, Azure Artifacts will return the packages in the view configured for that upstream source. Thus, a query to feed A does not actually result in a transitive query to feed C (A -> B -> C), because views are read-only. A has access to any packages from C that a user of B has previously saved into B, but not the full set of packages available in C.

Thus, the onus falls to B to ensure that its local packages represent a complete dependency graph, so that users who consume B's package via an upstream source from another feed are able to successfully resolve the graph and install their desired B package.

## Example: constructing the set of available packages

Assume three feeds, Fabrikam, Contoso, and AdventureWorks. In this example, we'll look at the packages available to the Fabrikam feed as we add upstream sources.

At first, Fabrikam has no upstream sources, and users connected to Fabrikam can only install versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 of the Widgets package. Likewise, Contoso has no upstream sources, and users connected to Contoso can only install versions 1.0.0 and 3.0.0 of the Gizmos package. Ditto for the AdventureWorks feed, where connected users can only install versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 of the Gadgets package or version 1.0.0 of the Things package.

Next, consider what happens if Contoso adds AdventureWorks as an upstream source. A user connected to Contoso can install any version of Gizmos, any version of Gadgets, or any version of Things. If Gadgets@2.0.0 is installed, that package-version is saved to Contoso (with a link back to AdventureWorks).

Now, let's have the Fabrikam feed add Contoso as an upstream source. A user connected to Fabrikam can install any version of Widgets, any version of Gizmos, but **only saved** versions (2.0.0) of Gadgets.

:::image type="content" source="media/upstream-source-graph-3.svg" alt-text="Fabrikam adds Contoso as an upstream source":::

The user will not be able to install version 1.0.0 of Gadgets or any version of Things, because those package versions haven't been saved to Contoso by a Contoso user.
