# Get started with NuGet packages in Azure Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Artifacts enables developers to publish, and download NuGet packages from different sources such as feeds and public registries. Artifact feeds can be private to share your packages with your team and specific users, or public to share them publicly with anyone on the internet.

In this article, you'll learn:

> * How to create a new feed  
> * How to set up your project and connect to your feed  
> * How to publish NuGet packages to your feed
> * How to download NuGet packages from your feed  

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization. [Create an organization](../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md), if you don't have one already.
- [Install NuGet client tools](/nuget/install-nuget-client-tools)

## Create a feed

You can create [two types of feeds](./feeds/project-scoped-feeds.md#project-scoped-vs-organization-scoped-feeds): project-scoped and organization-scoped feeds. All public feeds are scoped to their hosting project and they inherit its visibility settings.

[!INCLUDE [](includes/create-feed.md)]

## Connect to feed

1. From within your project, select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select **Connect to feed**.

::: moniker-end

## Publish NuGet packages  

Run the following command in an elevated command prompt window to set up your nuget.config file and publish your NuGet package to your feed. See [nuget sources](/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-sources), and [nuget push](/nuget/reference/cli-reference/cli-ref-push) for more details:

```Command
nuget sources add -Name <SourceName> -Source <SourceURL> -username <UserName> -password <Pat>
nuget push -Source <SourceName> -ApiKey key <PackagePath>
```

If you don't have a NuGet package but want to try publishing packages to your feed, you can install the _HelloWorld_ sample package as follows:
   
```Command
nuget install HelloWorld -ExcludeVersion
```
