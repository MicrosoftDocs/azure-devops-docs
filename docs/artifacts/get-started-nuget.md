# Quickstart: Get started with NuGet packages in Azure Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]]

Azure Artifacts enables developers to publish and download NuGet packages from sources such as feeds and public registries. With Azure Artifacts, you can create feeds that are either:

* Private, so you can share packages with your team and specific users.
* Public, so you can share packages openly with anyone on the internet.

In this quickstart, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Create a new feed.
> * Set up your project and connect to your feed.
> * Publish NuGet packages.
> * Download packages from your feed.

## Prerequisites

* Create an Azure DevOps [organization](../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md) and a [project](../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you haven't already.

* Install the [latest NuGet version](https://www.nuget.org/downloads).

* Install the [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider#azure-artifacts-credential-provider).

## Publish packages  

To publish your package to your feed, run the following command. You can enter any string for the `ApiKey` argument.

```Command
nuget.exe push -Source <SOURCE_NAME> -ApiKey key <PACKAGE_PATH>
```

**Examples:**

- Project-scoped feed:

    ```CLI
    nuget.exe push -Source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/myOrganization/MyProject/_packaging/MyFeed/nuget/v3/index.json -ApiKey AZ release/myDemoPackage.1.0.0.nupkg
    ```

- Organization-scoped feed:

    ```CLI
    nuget.exe push -Source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/myOrganization/_packaging/myFeed/nuget/v3/index.json -ApiKey AZ release/myDemoPackage.1.0.0.nupkg
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The `ApiKey` is required, but you can use any arbitrary value when publishing to Azure Artifacts feeds.
