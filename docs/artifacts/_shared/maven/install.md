Install Maven artifacts from your feed by using the Maven client.

The most common way to install a Maven artifact is as a dependency of another artifact.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. Create a Maven artifact by using the following command: 

   ```Command
   mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId="org.apache.maven.archetypes" -DgroupId="MyGroup" -DartifactId="mySecondApp"
   ```

2. In **Azure Artifacts**, browse to the artifact that you want to install and copy the contents of the `<dependency>` element.

3. Paste the `<dependency>` element content inside the `<dependencies>` element of your pom.xml file.

4. Run `mvn install` from the directory that contains your pom.xml file.

See the [Maven CLI docs](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-install-plugin/usage.html) for more installation options.
