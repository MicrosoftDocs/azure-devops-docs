To talk to Azure DevOps Services feeds, you'll need a token on your local machine that Maven can pick up and pass to Azure DevOps Services.  

   ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. From the **Azure Artifacts** page, select **Connect to Feed**.

   ::: moniker-end

   ::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018 < azure-devops-2019"

2. From the **Packages** page, select **Connect to Feed**.

   ::: moniker-end

3. Open the **Maven** tab, select **Generate Maven credentials**, and copy the generated credentials.

   * Maven pulls credentials from your **settings.xml** file.
   
   * On Linux, the file path is usually `"${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml"`.
   
   * On macOS, the file path is usually `"~/.m2/settings.xml"`.
   
   * On Windows, the file path is usually `"%USERPROFILE%/.m2/settings.xml"`.
   
   * If the file doesn't exist, create one now.

4. Inside the `<settings>` and `<servers>` elements in the file, paste the credentials that you copied in **Step 3**.

**Sample settings.xml:**

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <!-- Copy this section from the Maven section of the "Connect to Feed" dialog" -->
    <server>
      <id>dev.azure.com-yourFeedName</id>
      <username>Authorization</username>
        <!--The generated token expires on or before 7/19/2017-->
      <password>Y2Fqb...</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `<id>` tags in the _settings.xml_ and the _pom.xml_ **must** match.

You can find more information about the settings.xml file in the [settings.xml reference](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html).
