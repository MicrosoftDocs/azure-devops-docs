Publish npm packages to a feed in Azure Artifacts to share them with your team and your organization.

1. [Set up the npm client with your feed](../../npm/npmrc.md).

1. Open a shell and navigate to the directory that contains your package's **package.json** file.
   If you don't have a **package.json** file, run `npm init` ([see the npm CLI docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)).
   
1. Push your package by running `npm publish`.

See the [npm CLI docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) for more publish options.
