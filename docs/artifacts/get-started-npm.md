# Get started with npm packages in Azure Artifacts

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Using Azure Artifacts, you can publish and download your npm packages from feeds and public registries such as npmjs.com. This quickstart will guide you through creating your feed, configuring your project, and managing npm packages with your Azure Artifacts feed.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization. [Create one for free](../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md).

- An Azure DevOps project. Create a new [project](../organizations/projects/create-project.md#create-a-project) if you don't have one already.

- [Download and install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Create a feed

[!INCLUDE [](includes/create-feed.md)]

## Connect to a feed

> [!NOTE]
> `vsts-npm-auth` is not supported in Azure DevOps Server.

Azure Artifacts recommends using two .npmrc files. The first one should be placed in the *$home* directory (Linux/macOS) or *$env.HOME* (Windows) to securely store your credentials. This allows the npm client to locate the file and retrieve your credentials for authentication, enabling you to share your config file without exposing your credentials. In this section, we will set up the second *.npmrc* file, which should be placed in the same directory as your *package.json* file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> npm supports a single `registry` in your .npmrc file. Multiple registries are possible with [scopes](npm/scopes.md) and [upstream sources](npm/upstream-sources.md).

## Publish packages

Run the following command in your project directory to publish your npm packages:

```Command
npm publish
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the `publishConfig` property to override the registry config param at publish-time is not supported. 

## Restore packages

Run the following command in your project directory to restore your npm packages:

```Command
npm install
```

To restore a specific npm package, run the following command from your project directory:

```Command
npm install --save <PACKAGE_NAME>
```
