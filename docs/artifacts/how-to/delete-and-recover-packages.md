# Delete and recover packages

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure Artifacts safely stores different types of packages in your feed, whether you published them directly or saved them from upstream sources. As older package versions fall out of use, you might want to clean them up either manually or automatically by using retention policies. 

In this article, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]  
> * Delete packages from feeds.
> * Set up retention policies to automatically delete older packages.
> * Recover recently deleted packages from the Recycle Bin.

> [!NOTE]
> To delete/recover packages or set up retention policies, you must be a feed **Owner**.

## Delete packages

#### [Maven](#tab/maven/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select the package that you want to delete, and then select **Delete latest**. Select **Delete** to confirm. 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

1. Select **Build and Release**, and then select **Packages**.

1. Select your feed, and then select the package that you want to delete.

1. Select **Delete latest** to delete the latest version of your package.

In Azure Artifacts, packages are immutable. When you publish a package to your feed, its version number will be reserved permanently. You can't upload a new package with that same version number, even if you delete it from your feed.

::: moniker-end

#### [npm](#tab/npm/)

There are two options to delete an npm package from your feed:

- **Deprecate**: When you deprecate a package version, a warning message is added to the package's metadata. Azure Artifacts and most npm clients will display the warning message whenever the package is viewed or installed. 
- **Unpublish**: Unpublishing a package version makes it unavailable to install. Unpublished packages can be restored from the Recycle Bin within 30 days of deletion. After that, the packages will be permanently deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a **Contributor** to deprecate a package and an **Owner** to unpublish it.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select the package that you want to delete or deprecate, and then select **Deprecate** or **Unpublish latest**.

#### Deprecate or unpublish an npm package by using the CLI

1. [Set up your client's .npmrc file](../npm/npmrc.md).

1. Use the following command to deprecate an npm package:

    ```Command
    npm deprecate <package>[@<version>] <message>
    ```

   Use the following command to unpublish an npm package:

    ```Command
    npm unpublish <package>@<version>
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The `npm unpublish` command won't unpublish all versions of the package. For more information, see the [deprecate](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/deprecate) or [unpublish](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/unpublish) documentation.

#### [NuGet](#tab/nuget/)

Two options are available to delete a NuGet package from your feed:

- **Unlist**: Unlisting a package version hides it from the search results in Azure Artifacts feeds and on NuGet.org.
- **Delete**:  Deleting a package version makes it unavailable to install. Deleted packages can be restored from the Recycle Bin within 30 days of deletion. After that, the packages will be permanently deleted.

In Azure Artifacts, packages are immutable. When you publish a package to your feed, its version number will be reserved permanently. You can't upload a new package with that same version number, even if you delete it from your feed.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a **Contributor** to unlist a package and an **Owner** to delete it.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select the package that you want to delete or deprecate, and then select **Unlist** or **Delete latest**.

### Unlist a NuGet package by using NuGet.exe

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then go to your feed. Select **Connect to feed**.

   ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

     :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-to-feed-azure-devops-newnav.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button for connecting to a feed.":::

   ::: moniker-end

   ::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

    :::image type="content" source="../media/connect-to-feed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button for connecting to a feed in Team Foundation Server.":::

   ::: moniker-end

2. Select **NuGet.exe**, and then find and copy your **Package Source** URL.

3. Run the following command:

    ```Command
    nuget.exe delete <PACKAGE_NAME> <PACKAGE_VERSION> -Source <PACKAGE_SOURCE_URL> -ApiKey <KEY>
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> Azure DevOps and Visual Studio Team Foundation Server interpret the `nuget.exe delete` command as an unlist operation. To delete a package, you must use the REST API or the web interface.

#### [Python](#tab/python/)

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select the package that you want to delete, and then select **Delete latest**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a feed **Owner** to delete a Python package.

:::image type="content" source="../media/delete/delete-python-package.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button for deleting a package in Python.":::

#### [Universal Package](#tab/universal/)

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select your feed.

1. Select the package that you want to delete, and then select **Delete latest**.

> [!NOTE]
> You must be a feed **Owner** to delete a Universal Package.

:::image type="content" source="../media/delete/delete-universal-package.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button for deleting a Universal Package.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Packages sent to the Recycle Bin will be deleted permanently after 30 days. However, these packages still count as part of your storage bill. If you want to delete them sooner, go to the Recycle Bin and delete them manually.

## Delete packages automatically with retention policies

The number of versions for each package hosted in your feed can grow quickly. To free up storage space, you can set up retention policies to automatically delete old packages.

If you want to retain a package indefinitely, you can promote it to a [view](../concepts/views.md). Packages promoted to a view are exempt from retention policies and won't be deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> Package demotion is not supported. If you want this feature to be added to future releases, feel free to use **Suggest a feature** on our [Azure DevOps Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/21/index.html) page.

To configure retention policies:

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Select **Artifacts**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/goto-feed-hub-azure-devops-newnav.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Artifacts button.":::

1. Select the gear icon to navigate to your feed's settings.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/feed-settings.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing how to navigate to feed settings.":::

1. Select **Feed details**, and then select the **Enable package retention** checkbox. Then enter values for:

    - **Maximum number of versions per package**: How many versions of a package you want to keep.
    - **Days to keep recently downloaded packages**: Packages will be deleted only if they haven't been downloaded for the number of days set in here.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/retention-policy-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to enable retention policies for your feed.":::
    
1. Select **Save** when you're done.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

1. Select **Build and Release**.

1. Select **Packages**, and then select the gear icon to access your feed's settings. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/edit-feed-full.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how access the feed's settings in Team Foundation Server.":::


1. From the **Retention** tab, enter values for:

    - **Maximum number of versions per package**: How many versions of a package you want to keep.
    - **Days to keep recently downloaded packages**: Packages will be deleted only if they haven't been downloaded for the number of days set in here.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/retention-policy-settings-tfs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows retention policies in Team Foundation Server.":::
   
    
1. Select **Save** when you're done.

::: moniker-end

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable package retention, a version of a package will be deleted when *both* of the following criteria are met:
> - The number of published versions reaches the **Maximum number of versions per package** limit.
> - A version of that package has not been downloaded for the period defined in **Days to keep recently downloaded packages**.

### What happens with old or existing packages when we enable retention policies?

Old or existing packages will be soft-deleted and moved to the Recycle Bin. The deletion job runs once a day, but there might be an initial delay after the policy is turned on for the first time because of an influx of packages. 

Packages remain in the Recycle Bin for 30 days before they're permanently deleted. To remove the packages from your billable storage, you can choose to delete them manually by using the UI or the REST API before the 30 days are up. 

## Recover deleted packages

Deleted packages will remain in the Recycle Bin for 30 days. After that, they'll be permanently deleted. You must be a feed **Owner** to recover deleted packages.
