# Receive notifications when a new package version is published

When you follow a package, you’ll be notified every time a new version of that package is published. Notifications are sent to your preferred email address, which you can [change from your organization preferences](../../notifications/change-email-address.md).


## Steps

1. From the feed page, select the package you want to follow
2. Click the **Follow** button

## Follow a package with views

If you’re using release views, you can get notifications when new version of a package is promoted to a view. This can reduce the notification spam if a lot of packages are being published, but only a few are being promoted to a view.

1. Go to the feed page
2. Filter to a view (e.g. @release)
3. Go to the package you want to follow
4. Click the **Follow** button

## Follow a package from the notification settings page

 In addition to following a package from the _Feeds_ page, you can [manage your personal notifications](../../notifications/howto-manage-personal-notifications.md) and set up a personal notification for a package or set of packages from the _Notification Settings_ page.
