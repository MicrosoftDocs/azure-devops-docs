# Publish Maven packages to an Azure Artifacts feed

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Azure Artifacts provides a centralized way to host and manage your packages in a single feed. This article guides you through connecting to an Azure Artifacts feed and publishing your Maven packages.

## Prerequisites

| **Product**        | **Requirements**                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Azure DevOps**   | - An Azure DevOps [organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md).<br>- An Azure DevOps [project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).<br> - [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) Maven. |

## Create a feed

If you already have a feed, you can skip this section. Otherwise, follow the steps below to create a new feed:

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and navigate to your project.

1. Select **Artifacts**, and then select **Create Feed**.

1. Enter a **Name** for your feed, choose its **Visibility**, then select its **Scope**. To include packages from public registries, select the **Upstream sources** checkbox.

1. Select **Create** when you're done.

## Publish packages

1. If you havenâ€™t already authenticated with your feed, follow the steps in [Project setup](project-setup-maven.md) to connect to your feed.

1. Run the following command in your project directory to publish your package:

    ```
    mvn deploy
    ```

1. Once published, navigate to your feed. You should see your packages listed, as shown in the example below:
