# Publish Maven artifacts using Gradle

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

In this article, you will learn how to connect to an Azure Artifacts feed and publish Maven artifacts using Gradle.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization. [Create an organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md), if you don't have one already.

- An Azure Artifacts feed. [Create a feed](../concepts/feeds.md#create-public-feeds) if you don't have one already.

- Download and install [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html).

- Install [Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

## Project setup

Before setting up your project, ensure that you have installed Gradle and added the Maven Settings plugin to your *build.gradle* file as follows:

```groovy
plugins {
  id "net.linguica.maven-settings" version "0.5"
}
```

### Create a personal access token

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps organization, and then navigate to your project.

1. Select **User settings**, and then select **Personal access tokens**.

1. Select **New Token**, and then fill out the required fields. Make sure you select the **Packaging** > **Read & write** scope.

1. Select **Create** when you are done. Copy your token and save it in a secure location.

### Configure build.gradle

1. If a *build.gradle* file does not exist in the root of your project, create a new file and name it: *build.gradle*.

1. Add the following section to your *build.gradle* file in both the **repositories** and **publishing.repositories** containers. 

    ```groovy
    maven {
        url 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/maven/v1'
        name '<FEED_NAME>'
        authentication {
            basic(BasicAuthentication)
        }
    }
    ```
1. Here's an example of what your *build.gradle* file should look like:

    ```groovy
    publishing { 
        publications { 
            myPublication(MavenPublication) { 
                groupId '<GROUP_ID>' 
                artifactId '<ARTIFACT_ID>' 
                version '<VERSION_NUMBER>'           
                artifact '<PATH_TO_YOUR_JAR_FILE>'   
            } 
        } 
    
        // Repositories to publish artifacts 
        repositories { 
            maven {
                url 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/maven/v1'
                name '<FEED_NAME>'
                authentication {
                    basic(BasicAuthentication)
                }
            }
        } 
    } 
     
    // Repositories to fetch dependencies
    repositories { 
            maven {
                url 'https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/<PROJECT_NAME>/_packaging/<FEED_NAME>/maven/v1'
                name '<FEED_NAME>'
                authentication {
                    basic(BasicAuthentication)
                }
            }
    } 
    ```

### Configure settings.xml

1. Open your *settings.xml* file in your home directory and add the following snippet. Replace the placeholders with your feed name, organization name, and the personal access token you created earlier.

    ```xml
    <server>
        <id>[FEED_NAME]</id>
        <username>[ORGANIZATION_NAME]</username>
        <password>[PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN]</password>
    </server>
    ```

## Publish artifacts

Run the following command in an elevated command prompt to publish your package to your feed. Your new package will be named: *groupId:artifactId*.

```Command
gradle publish
```
