> A symbol server is available with **Azure Artifacts** in Azure DevOps Services and works best with **Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 or later**. **Team Foundation Server** users and users without the **Azure Artifacts** extension can publish symbols to a file share using a [build task](../../pipelines/tasks/build/index-sources-publish-symbols.md).
