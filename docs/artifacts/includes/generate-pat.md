Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) using the instructions [Authenticate access with personal access tokens](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md). Scope your PAT to the organization(s) you want to access and to one of the following scopes: *Packaging (read)*, *Packaging (read and write)*, or *Packaging (read, write, and manage).*

> [!NOTE]
> We strongly recommend **not checking your PAT into source control**. Anyone with access to your PAT can gain access to your Azure DevOps Services.
