# Debug with WinDbg

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Azure Artifacts provides a dedicated symbols server for publishing symbols. This server allows you to connect a debugger that can automatically fetch the correct symbol files, enabling you to debug your application efficiently. With tools like WinDbg, you can load an executable, attach the debugger to a running process, consume your symbols, set up breakpoints, and systematically analyze your code.

## Add symbol server to WinDbg

To use the Azure Artifacts symbol server, you must add your organization to the symbols search path, but before we can do that, we must first create a personal access token.

1. Create a [Personal Access Token](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md#create-a-pat) with **Symbols (read)** scope and copy it to your clipboard.

1. Open WinDbg, or [install](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/) it if you haven't already.

1. Select **File**, and then select **OpenExecutable** to load the executable you wish to debug.

1. Run the following command to set the symbols path. Replace the placeholder with your specific organization name:


    ```Command
    .sympath+ https://artifacts.dev.azure.com/<ORGANIZATION_NAME>/_apis/symbol/symsrv
    ```

1. Set a breakpoint by running the [bp command](/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bp--bu--bm--set-breakpoint-). this will trigger a symbols request.

1. During the authentication prompt, insert the *personal access token* you generated earlier. You can leave the *username* field empty. WinDbg will proceed to obtain the symbols for your executable.

1. To verify if your symbols are loaded, run the **lm** command to list all loaded modules.

## Start debugging
