# New features added through feature enablement 

<b>TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013</b>  

> [!NOTE]
> <b>Feature availability: </b>This topic applies only to projects defined on an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS). Projects defined on Azure DevOps Services [update automatically with each service upgrade](/azure/devops/release-notes/index).

The Configure Features Wizard detects which features have and haven't been configured. Most new features include additions or changes to work item types (WITs), categories, or process configuration. New features are introduced with different updates to Team Foundation Server (TFS).

New web form
</td>
<td>
<p>Adds the <strong>WebLayout</strong> section within the <strong>FORM</strong> section of all work item type (WIT) definitions. This section supports the <a href="process/new-work-item-experience.md" data-raw-source="[new work tracking experience in the web portal](process/new-work-item-experience.md)">new work tracking experience in the web portal</a>. It includes the <strong>SystemControls</strong> section and the new <strong>LinksControlOptions</strong> for managing link relationships. To learn more, see <a href="xml/weblayout-xml-elements.md" data-raw-source="[WebLayout and Control elements](xml/weblayout-xml-elements.md)">WebLayout and Control elements</a> and <a href="xml/linkscontroloptions-xml-elements.md" data-raw-source="[LinksControlOptions XML elements (Web form)](xml/linkscontroloptions-xml-elements.md)">LinksControlOptions XML elements (Web form)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you upgrade an on-premises TFS to TFS 2017, the new web form is automatically available when you add projects to a collection. (You don&#39;t have to run the Configure Feature Wizard.) For existing projects, an admin is required to <a href="manage-new-form-rollout.md" data-raw-source="[enable the new form](manage-new-form-rollout.md)">enable the new form</a>. The reason the new form isn&#39;t automatically enabled for existing projects is to prevent overwriting customizations made to existing work item types.</p>

Not all new features require feature enablement.

### Test Plan and Test Suite features  
The Test Plan and Test Suite WITs are added when you run the TFS Upgrade Wizard. They aren't enabled through the Configure Feature wizard. They support customization of test plans and test suites

<p>The enhancements support:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Test plans and test suites are now work item types (WITs). You can add fields, change the workflow, and <a href="add-modify-wit.md" data-raw-source="[customize them like any other work item type](add-modify-wit.md)">customize them like any other work item type</a>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The area path security model now contains permissions to <b>Manage test suites</b>. The <b>Manage test plans</b> permissions has been re-scoped to manage only test plans. Previously it covered permission management of both test plans and test suites.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The History field for test-related artifacts now provides a consolidated view of changes made to work item fields as well as changes to related artifacts such as test points and test configurations. A new field, the Test Suite Audit field, available in the test suite work item form, captures and displays these related artifact changes in the work item history.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The server upgrade automatically converts existing test plans and test suites to WITs and migrates test data and links. If it encounters a problem, a warning message appears in the server log.
