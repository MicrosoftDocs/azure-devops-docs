You use the `LinksControlOptions` element to define the options for controlling what links can be added to a work item and the default columns that you want to appear for the list of links in a work item. When you add a links control to a work item form, you can specify filters that restrict the types of links that users can be view and create and the types of work items to which users can create links. Specifically, you use the following elements as indicated:  
  
-   `WorkItemLinkFilters`: Use to restrict the types of links between work items in the current project.  
  
-   `ExternalLinkFilters`: Use to restrict the types of links that can be created between work items and other objects, such as changesets, hyperlinks, or version controlled files.  
  
-   `WorkItemTypeFilters`: Use to restrict the link relationships that users can create based on work item type and whether the work item is defined in the current project.  
  
In each of these elements, you can specify `Filter` elements to specify the link types or work item types that you want to include or exclude. For more information about how to use these elements, see [Define link controls to restrict link relationships](define-link-controls.md).  
  
The `LinksControlOptions` element is a child element of the `CONTROL` element.

### Parent Elements  
  
|Element|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[Control](control-xml-element-reference.md)|Required. Defines a field, text, hyperlink, or other control element to appear on the work item form.|  
  
## Remarks  
`LinksControlOptions` is an optional child element of `Control` element where `ControlType="LinksControl"`. You can use the `LinksControlOptions` element to support the following actions:   
-   Specify the restrictions that govern the creation of relationships to other work items based on the link type and, optionally, the forward and reverse names of the link types.  
-   Specify the restrictions that govern the creation of relationships to objects other than work items, such as changeset, hyperlink, and so on, based on external link types.   
-   Specify the restrictions that govern the creation of relationships to other work items based on work item type and, optionally, the project where those work items are defined.    
-   Specify the default column fields that you want to display information for the link list.  
  
## Example  
 The following example specifies how to enable the creation of links whose type is `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.TestedBy` and show the `Forward Name` for this link type. The filter options disallow creation of links to all external link types. In addition, displayed default column fields for the listed links correspond to the following friendly names: ID, Work Item Type, Title, Assigned To, State, and the Comment field defined for the link. For more examples, see [Define link controls to restrict link relationships](define-link-controls.md).

##  LinksControl toolbar buttons  
Each `Control` element of Type=LinksControl provides a toolbar, which contains the buttons shown in the next illustration:  
  
![Work item form link toolbar controls](_img/procguid_linktoolbar.png "ProcGuid_LinkToolbar")  
  
These buttons become available only after you perform a specific action:  
  
-   The button to create a work item that is linked to the open work item (![Add New Linked Work Item icon](_img/icon_addnewlinkedworkitem.png "Icon_addNewLinkedWorkItem")) becomes available only after you save the open work item.    
-   The buttons to open the list of work items in a query (![Open in Query](_img/icon_openinquery.png "Icon_openInQuery")) and in a Microsoft Office client (![Open in Office](_img/wit_iconoffice.png "WIT_IconOffice")) become available only when at least one work item is listed in the links control tab.   
-   The buttons to open a work item (![Open Work Item](_img/icon_openworkitem.png "Icon_openWorkItem")), edit a link (![Edit link](_img/icon_witlinkedit.png "Icon_WITLinkEdit")), and delete a link (![Delete link](_img/icon_witlinkdelete.png "Icon_WITLinkDelete")) become available only after you click one or more work items listed in the links control tab.  
  
The links control that is displayed is the same for both the web portal and Team Explorer, except when it is configured to only render `Storyboard` links. In that case, the toolbar only contains those controls to add a new link, open the linked item, and delete the link. Also, the web portal version displays the **Start Storyboarding** link within the control menu.
