# Reportable fields reference 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-all-versions.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This topic applies to project customization for On-premises XML process models. For you to view SQL Server reports, you must have configured your Azure DevOps Server or Team Foundation Server (TFS) and project to support reporting. See [Add reports to a project](../../report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project.md).

>For an overview of process models and customization options, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../customize-work.md). 


A default set of fields appears in the relational warehouse database or the cube. The following tables list those reportable fields defined in the default process templates. These fields have a `reportable` attribute value of `Detail`, `Dimension`, or `Measure`. See [Add or modify work item fields to support reporting](add-or-modify-work-item-fields-to-support-reporting.md).  

For a complete list of fields that are defined in the default process templates, see [Work item field index](../../boards/work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).  

<a name="detail"></a> 
## Detail fields  
Detail fields are written to the relational warehouse database, but not to the cube.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |**Field name**|**Description**|**Data type**| 
> |------|------|------|
> |Backlog Priority|A number that represents the relative priority for a bug, product backlog item, or task. (Scrum process only.)<br/><br/>Reference name: Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority|Double|
> |Revised Date|The date and time stamp when a test case or shared step is revised.<br/> **Note:**  This field is not included in the work item form and is not populated with any data.<br/><br/>Reference name: System.RevisedDate|DateTime|  

<a name="dimension"></a> 
##  Dimension fields  
 Dimension fields are written both to the relational warehouse database and to the cube.
