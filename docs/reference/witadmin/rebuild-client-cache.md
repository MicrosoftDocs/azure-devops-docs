# Rebuild the client cache

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-azure-devops.md)]

After certain maintenance operations, client computers require a cache refresh. After you move, restore, rename, or fail over a data-tier or application-tier server, you must refresh the cache for tracking work items and users must refresh the version control cache on client computers.  

> [!NOTE]    
> This article applies to project customization of on-premises Azure DevOps Server. 

You can force a rebuild of the cache on each client computer the next time it connects to a project collection by using the **witadmin rebuildcache** command.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid server performance issues, don't run this command during normal operating hours.  
  
[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/witadmin-run-tool.md)]  
  

## Prerequisites 
  
- To use the **witadmin rebuildcache** command, you must be a member of the **Team Foundation Administrators** group or the **Project Administrators** group for the project collection that you want to manage. See [Change project collection-level permissions](../../organizations/security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Even if you sign in with administrative permissions, you must open an elevated Command Prompt window to perform this function on a server that is running Windows Server 2008. To open an elevated Command Prompt window, choose **Start**, open the shortcut menu for **Command Prompt**, and choose **Run as Administrator**. For more information, see the [Microsoft Web site](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc772207(v=ws.10)).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
witadmin rebuildcache /collection:CollectionURL [/noprompt]  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|**Parameter**|**Description**|  
|-------------------|---------------------|  
|**/collection**:`CollectionURL`|Specifies the URI of the project collection. For example:<br /> **On-premises TFS format:  http**://*ServerName:Port/VirtualDirectoryName/CollectionName*<br /><br /> If no virtual directory is used, then the format for the URI is as shown: **http**://*ServerName:Port/CollectionName*.|  
|**/noprompt**|Disables the prompt for confirmation.|  
|**/?** or **help**|Displays help about the command in the Command Prompt window.|  
  
## Remarks  

The **witadmin rebuildcache** command invalidates cached data on all clients for a specified project collection. It causes a cache refresh  for each client the next time the client connects to the project collection.  
  
## Example   

The following command invalidates the metadata cache for all clients that connect to *DefaultCollection* that is defined on the server that is named *AdventureWorksServer*. The client caches are updated the next time they connect to the project collection.  
  
```  
witadmin rebuildcache /collection:http://AdventureWorksServer:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection  
```
