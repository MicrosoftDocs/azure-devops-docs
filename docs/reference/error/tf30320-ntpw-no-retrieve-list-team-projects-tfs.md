# TF30320: The New Team Project Wizard could not retrieve the list of projects on the Team Foundation Server {0}.

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

This error occurs when the New Team Project Wizard attempts to check the Team Foundation Server {*name*} to determine if there is already a project with the name you typed. The wizard has already established a connection with the server, but the connection is no longer working.  
  
 The likely causes of this problem are:  
  
- The network is not available    
- The Team Foundation server is not available    
- There is an unexpected problem with the CommonStructureService Web service.  
  
  The procedures below will help you correct the cause.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Confirm that your local computer is plugged into the network and can access network resources.  
  
2.  Contact the administrator for the Team Foundation Server *name* to confirm that the server is available on the network.  
  
3.  Contact the administrator for the Team Foundation Server *name* for further instructions.
