# TF30016: You do not have permission to create a new SQL Server Reporting Services site on the server {0}.

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

This error occurs when the permissions granted to your user account on the SQL Server Reporting Services server {*name*} are not sufficient to enable you to create the reporting site. You use the reporting site as the project Report site. You must be granted specific permission by the SQL Server Reporting Services administrator.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Contact the administrator for the SQL Server Reporting Services server {*name*} and ask that your user account be assigned the role of **Content Manager**.  See also [Grant permissions to view or create reports](../../report/admin/grant-permissions-to-reports.md)
  
You must also have the **Full Control** permission set on the server that hosts SharePoint Products. Your Team Foundation Server administrator may also be able to grant you the required permissions.
