# TF30172: You do not have permission to create a new project

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You receive this error when your run the New Team Project Wizard under the following conditions:  
  
-   Your **Create project** permission isn't set to Allow.  
  
     Correct this error by contacting your administrator and ask that the permission **Create new projects** be added to your user account.  
  
     If your on-premises TFS supports SharePoint Products or SQL Server Reporting Services, you might need to have permissions set for those products as well. See [Add accounts to administer project collections](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).  
  
-   You're client version isn't compatible with the TFS version where you're trying to create a project. 
  
     To create a project or manage process templates on an on-premises TFS, you must connect using the same version level of Visual Studio or Team Explorer. That is, to create a project for an on-premises TFS 2015, you must connect from Team Explorer 2015. You can [download and install released versions of Visual Studio Community](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) in a side by side configuration for free.
