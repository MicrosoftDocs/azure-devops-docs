# Process template and plug-in files

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/customization-phase-0-and-1-plus-version-header.md)]

You customize the initial configuration of projects by customizing one or more process template files. You can customize several types of template files, which include the root XML file, plug-in files, and XML definition files. By customizing these files, you can define the initial configuration of all projects that are created from the process template.  
  
For information about the default process templates, see [Choose a process](../../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md). To learn about customizing a process template, see [Customize a process template](customize-process.md).

## Client support for project creation

Depending on whether you work from the Azure DevOps Services or TFS, you can create a project from the web portal or from Visual Studio/Team Explorer.

| Client | Azure DevOps Services | TFS 2018 and TFS 2017 |  TFS 2015 and earlier versions |  
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|  
|Web portal | ![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png)| ![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png) | ![not supported](../../_img/icons/delete_icon.png)  |
|Visual Studio/Team Explorer | ![not supported](../../_img/icons/delete_icon.png) | ![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png) |![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png)|  

(![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png)- Supported; ![not supported](../../_img/icons/delete_icon.png) - Not supported)  

When you create a project from the web portal, the following plug-in files are ignored. 

- **Build**: Default security permissions are defined for build functions.
- **Lab Management**: Native build and release management tools replace the previous lab management tools. To learn more, see  [Use Build and Release instead of Lab Management for automated testing](../../test/lab-management/use-build-or-rm-instead-of-lab-management.md). 
- **Reports**: See [Add reports to a project](../../report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project.md) to add SQL Reports after you create the project. 
- **Version Control**: Default security permissions and TFVC check-in policies are defined for git and TFVC functions.
- **Windows SharePoint Services**: TFS 2018 and later versions no longer support native integration with SharePoint products. See [About SharePoint integration](../../report/sharepoint-dashboards/about-sharepoint-integration.md) to learn about the options available to you. For TFS 2017 and earlier versions, you must use Visual Studio/Team Explorer to add SharePoint Integration. 
- **Custom plug-ins**: Not supported.

For details, review [Plug-in file descriptions and PCW support](#PlugInFiles).

  
<a name="Root"></a> 
##  The root process template file  
 You customize the root XML file, ProcessTemplate.xml, to define the sequence of plug-in files to be processed and the dependencies of each plug-in. The ProcessTemplate.xml file contains all task groups that must run to successfully create a project. Each task group references a subordinate XML plug-in file (often in a subfolder) where the specific tasks are defined. For more information, see [Define the root tasks](define-root-tasks-process-template-plug-in.md).  
   
 
<a name="PlugInFiles"></a> 
## Plug-in file descriptions and PCW support   

Each plug-in file configures a specific functional area by defining one or more tasks. Tasks specify to upload a file, set permissions for a group, or configure some other functional area. For example, the Work Item Tracking plug-in configures the work item types, queries, categories, and process configuration for a project. 

The following table describes each plug-in file and whether or not it is supported when creating a project from Visual Studio/Team Explorer or the web portal.The order in which the plug-ins are called is determined by the root process template file. Except for the Classification plug-in, plug-ins can also be deleted from the process template.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Starting with TFS 2018 and later versions, you will only be able to create a project creation from the web portal. No custom plug-ins are supported.

<p>This plug-in also uploads the information contained in the following files and folders:</p> 
<ul>
<li>**Process Guidance**: Uploads a set of .htm files which contain a URL that opens process guidance topics when a user clicks the ![Open process guidance for work item](_img/processguidance_wi_icon.png "ProcessGuidance_WI_Icon") help icon from the client version of a work item form. These files can be customized to point to other resources for process guidance. </li>

<blockquote>
Process template files do not include dashboards or Microsoft Excel reports. These files are added to the project, depending on selections that are made when a project is created. If no SharePoint site is provisioned for the project, no dashboards or Office Excel reports are available. For more information about these artifacts, see the following topics: [Project portal dashboards](../../report/sharepoint-dashboards/project-portal-dashboards.md), [Excel reports (Agile)](../../report/excel/excel-reports.md), and [Excel reports (CMMI)](../../report/excel/excel-reports-cmmi.md).

The schema definition for process templates uses a mix of camel-case and all capitalized elements. If you encounter errors when validating your type definition files, check the case structure of your elements. Also, the case structure of opening and closing tags must match according to the rules for XML syntax. See [Process template plug-ins: Index to XML element definitions](process-template-plug-ins-xml-elements-index.md).
