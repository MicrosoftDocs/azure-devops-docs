# Azure Repos with Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/version-azure-devops.md)]  

If you use [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), you can use the 
[Azure Repos app for Teams](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200000643) to easily monitor your repositories. 
Set up and manage subscriptions to receive notifications in your channel whenever code is pushed/checked 
in or when a pull request (PR) is created, updated or merged. The app supports monitoring both Git and 
Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repositories.

Read this article to learn how to: 

> [!div class="checklist"]  
> * Add the Azure Repos app to your team in Microsoft Teams
> * Connect the Azure Repos app to your repositories
> * Manage subscriptions to repository related events in your channel
> * Using filters effectively to customize subscriptions


## Prerequisites

- To create subscriptions for repository-related events, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group or added to the team administrator role for the team.  To get added, see [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or [Add Team Administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md). 
- To receive notifications, you must enable the **Third-party application access via OAuth** setting for the Azure DevOps organization. See [Change application access policies for your organization](../../organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies.md).

> [!NOTE]
> * Notifications are currently not supported inside direct messages.
> * You can only link the Azure Repos app for Microsoft Teams to a project hosted on Azure DevOps Services.

## Add the Azure Repos app to your team in Microsoft Teams

Visit the App store in Microsoft Teams and search for the Azure Repos app. Upon installing, a welcome message from the app 
displays as shown in the following image. Use the `@azure repos` handle to start interacting with the app.
   
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Welcome message](./media/integrations-teams/welcome.png)


## Connect the Azure Repos app to your repositories

1. Once the app has been installed in your team, authenticate yourself to Azure Repos using the `@azure repos signin` command. Use **Sign in with different email** if your Microsoft Teams and Azure Boards are in different tenants. 
   
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Sign in prompt with different email.](./media/integrations-teams/SignIn.png)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Sign in prompt image ](./media/integrations-teams/SignIn1.png)

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Sign in complete.](./media/integrations-teams/SignIn-Complete.png)


2. To start monitoring all Git repositories in a project, use the following slash command inside a channel:

   ```
   @azure repos subscribe [project url]
   ```
   The project URL can be to any page within your project (except URLs to repositories).

   For example:

   ```
   @azure repos subscribe https://dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/
   ```

   You can also monitor a specific repository using the following command:

   ```
   @azure repos subscribe [repository url]
   ```

   The repository URL can be to any page within your repository that has your repository name.

   For example, for Git repositories, use:

   ```
   @azure repos subscribe https://dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/_git/myrepository
   ```

   For TFVC repositories, use:

   ```
   @azure repos subscribe https://dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject/_versionControl
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can subscribe only to public repositories. 

3. The `subscribe` command gets you started with a default subscription. For Git repositories, the channel gets subscribed to the **Pull request created** event (with target branch = master). For TFVC repositories, the channel is subscribed to the **Code checked in** event.

   > ![Default subscriptions creation message](./media/integrations-teams/Subscriptions-added-confirmation.png)


## Manage subscriptions

To view, add, and remove subscriptions for a channel, use the `subscriptions` command:

```
@azure repos subscriptions    
```

The `subscription` command lists all the current subscriptions for the channel and allows you to add new subscriptions or remove existing ones. 
When adding subscriptions, you can customize the notifications you get by using various filters, as described in the following section.

[!NOTE]
Team administrators aren't able to remove or modify subscriptions created by Project administrators.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![View subscriptions](./media/integrations-teams/Subscriptions.png)

## Using filters to get only notifications that you want

When a user subscribes to a repository using the `@azure repos subscribe` command, a default subscription is created with no filters applied.
Often, users need to customize these subscriptions to be notified only when certain conditions are met. 
For example, users may want to get notified only when PRs have a particular group added as reviewer. 

The following steps demonstrate how to customize subscriptions.

1.	Run the `@azure repos subscriptions` command.
2.	In the list of subscriptions, if there is a subscription that is unwanted or must be modified, select **Remove** to delete it.
3.	Select the **Add subscription** button.
4.	Select the required repository and the desired event.
5.	Select the appropriate filters to customize your subscription.

### Example: Get notifications only when my team is in the reviewer list for a PR

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Add subscription screen 1](./media/integrations-teams/Filters-1.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Add subscription screen 2](./media/integrations-teams/Filters-2.png)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Add subscription screen 3 with filters](./media/integrations-teams/Filters-3.png)
    
    
> [!NOTE]
> * All the filters are typically drop-downs. However if the drop-down were to have greater than 100 items, then you will need to enter the values manually.
> * For the TFVC **Code Checked in** event, the filter **Under path** must be of the format `$/myproject/path`.

## Search and share pull request information using compose extension

To help users search and share information about pull requests, Azure Repos app for Microsoft Teams supports compose extension. You can now search for pull requests by ID or name. For compose extension to work, users will have to sign into Azure Repos project that they are interested in either by running `@azure repos signin` command or by signing into the compose extension directly.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Compose extension](./media/integrations-teams/teams-repos-compose-extension.png)

## Previews of pull request URLs

When a user pastes the URL of a PR, a preview is shown like the one in the following image. This helps to keep PR-related conversations contextual and accurate.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![URL unfurling](./media/integrations-teams/URL-Preview.png)

For this feature to work, users have to be signed-in. Once they are signed in, this feature will work for all channels in a Team.

## Remove subscriptions and repositories from a channel

- Many a time, users want to clean up their channel by removing repositories and subscriptions. Use the below command to achieve the same.

	```
	@azure repos unsubscribe all [project url]
	```

	For example:

	```
	@azure repos unsubscribe all https://dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject
	```
This command will delete all the subscriptions related to any repository in the project and removes the repositories from the channel. Only project admins can run this command.

## Threaded notifications

- To logically link a set of related notifications and also to reduce the space occupied by notifications in a channel, notifications are threaded. All notifications linked to a particular pull request will be linked together.

### Compact view of threaded notifications

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Compact thread](./media/integrations-teams/threads-repos-compact-view.png)

### Expanded view of threaded notifications
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Expanded thread](./media/integrations-teams/threads-repos-expanded-view.png)

## Command reference

The following table lists all the `azure repos` commands you can use in your Teams channel.

|Command	| Functionality |

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing the following errors when using the Azure Repos App, follow the procedures in this section. 

[!INCLUDE [troubleshooting](./includes/repos-troubleshoot-authentication.md)]

In the **same browser**, start a new tab and sign in to `https://teams.microsoft.com/`. Run the `@Azure Repos signout` command and then run the `@Azure Repos signin` command in the channel where the Azure Repos app for Microsoft Teams is installed.

Select the `Sign in` button and you'll be redirected to a consent page like the one in the following example. Ensure that the directory shown beside the email is same as what was chosen in the previous step. Accept and complete the sign-in process.
