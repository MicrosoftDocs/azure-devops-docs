# Configure GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps

:::zone pivot="bundled-ghazdo"
GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps adds GitHub Advanced Security's suite of security features to Azure Repos and includes the following features:

* Secret Scanning push protection: check if code pushes include commits that expose secrets such as credentials  
* Secret Scanning repo scanning: scan your repository and look for exposed secrets that were committed accidentally
* Dependency Scanning – search for known vulnerabilities in open source dependencies (direct and transitive)
* Code Scanning – use CodeQL static analysis engine to identify code-level application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and authentication bypass
:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="standalone-ghazdo"
You can bring the protection of Advanced Security to your enterprise with the flexibility to enable the right level of protection for your repositories. GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is available as GitHub Secret Protection for Azure DevOps and GitHub Code Security for Azure DevOps. 

Secret Protection includes the following features: 
*   Push protection, to prevent secret leaks before they happen 
*   Secret scanning alerts with notifications, to catch existing exposures before they become a problem
*   Security overview, which provides insight into your organization's level of risk and security protection

Code Security includes the following features:
*   Dependency alerts, to find vulnerabilities in open-source dependencies 
*   CodeQL scanning, to detect vulnerabilities directly in your code 
*   Security findings for third-party tools 
*   Security overview, which provides insight into your organization's level of risk and security protection 
:::zone-end

GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is only available for Azure DevOps Services and specifically for code Git repositories. 

[!INCLUDE [GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is different from GitHub Advanced Security.](includes/github-advanced-security.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [github-advanced-security-prerequisites](includes/github-advanced-security-prerequisites.md)]

### Extra prerequisites for self-hosted agents

If your organization uses self-hosted agents, add the following URLs to your Allowlist so the dependency scanning task can fetch vulnerability advisory data. For more information, see [Allowed IP addresses and domain URLs](../../organizations/security/allow-list-ip-url.md). 

| Domain URL  | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `https://governance.dev.azure.com` | For organizations using the dev.azure.com domain to access their DevOps instance  |
| `https://dev.azure.com` | For organizations using the dev.azure.com domain to access their DevOps instance |
| `https://advsec.dev.azure.com` | For organizations using the dev.azure.com domain to access their DevOps instance |
| `https://{organization_name}.governance.visualstudio.com` | For organizations using the {organization_name}.visualstudio.com domain to access their DevOps instance   |
| `https://{organization_name}.visualstudio.com`  | For organizations using the {organization_name}.visualstudio.com domain to access their DevOps instance | 
| `https://{organization_name}.advsec.visualstudio.com` | For organizations using the {organization_name}.visualstudio.com domain to access their DevOps instance

* Run a compatible version of the .NET runtime (currently .NET 8.x). If a compatible version isn't present on the agent, the dependency scanning build task downloads [.NET](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 

* Ensure the CodeQL bundle is installed to the agent tool cache on your agent. You might utilize the `enableAutomaticCodeQLInstall: true` variable with the `AdvancedSecurity-Codeql-Init@1` pipeline task for YAML pipelines or select the `Enable automatic CodeQL detection and installation` checkbox for classic pipelines. Alternatively, for manual installation instructions, see [Code scanning for GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps](github-advanced-security-code-scanning-troubleshoot.md#manual-installation-of-codeql-bundle-to-self-hosted-agent).
  
## Enable GitHub Advanced Security
:::zone pivot="bundled-ghazdo"
You can enable Advanced Security at the organization, project, or repository level. To access each of the scanning tools and results, you need to first enable Advanced Security. Once you enable Advanced Security, any future pushes containing secrets to a repository with this policy enabled are blocked, and repository secret scanning happens in the background.

As mentioned, secret scanning repository scanning is automatically kicked off upon enabling Secret Protection for a selected repository. 

## Set up dependency scanning

To gain access to dependency scanning features, you need the **Code Security** product enabled for your repository.
:::zone-end

Dependency scanning is a pipeline-based scanning tool. Results are aggregated per repository. We recommend that you add the dependency scanning task to all the pipelines that you want scanned. 

>[!TIP] 
> For the most accurate scanning results, add the dependency scanning task after the build steps or package restore step in a pipeline that builds the code you wish to scan.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml)

Add the task Advanced Security Dependency Scanning task ([AdvancedSecurity-Dependency-Scanning@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/advanced-security-dependency-scanning-v1)) directly to your YAML pipeline file or select the **Advanced Security Dependency Scanning** task from the [task assistant](../../pipelines/get-started/yaml-pipeline-editor.md#use-task-assistant).

:::image type="content" source="media/dependency-scanning-config-yaml.png" lightbox="media/dependency-scanning-config-yaml.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dependency scanning pipeline setup for YAML.":::

#### [Classic](#tab/classic)

Add the `Advanced Security Dependency Scanning` task to your pipeline. 

:::image type="content" source="media/dependency-scanning-config-classic.png" lightbox="media/dependency-scanning-config-classic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dependency scanning pipeline setup for classic pipelines.":::


To generate alerts, run your first scan with a pipeline with the dependency scanning task included.

## Set up code scanning

:::zone pivot="standalone-ghazdo"
To gain access to code scanning features, you need the **Code Security** product enabled for your repository.
:::zone-end

Code scanning is also a pipeline-based scanning tool where results are aggregated per repository. 

>[!TIP] 
> Code scanning can be a more time-intensive build task, so we recommend that you add the code scanning task to a separate, cloned pipeline of your main production pipeline or create a new pipeline.

#### [YAML](#tab/yaml)

Add the tasks in the following order: 
1. Advanced Security Initialize CodeQL ([AdvancedSecurity-Codeql-Init@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/advanced-security-codeql-init-v1))
1. Your custom build steps
1. Advanced Security Perform CodeQL Analysis ([AdvancedSecurity-Codeql-Analyze@1](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/advanced-security-codeql-analyze-v1))

:::image type="content" source="media/code-scanning-config-yaml-tasks.png" lightbox="media/code-scanning-config-yaml-tasks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of code scanning pipeline setup for YAML.":::

Also, specify which language you're analyzing in the `Initialize CodeQL` task. You can use a comma separated list to analyze multiple languages at once. The supported languages are `csharp, cpp, go, java, javascript, python, ruby, swift`. If you're utilizing self-hosted agents, you might also add the `enableAutomaticCodeQLInstall: true` variable to automatically install the latest CodeQL bits for your agent.

Here's an example starter pipeline:

>[!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```yaml
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  # Additional hosted image options are available: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted#software
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:

  - task: AdvancedSecurity-Codeql-Init@1
    inputs:
      languages: "java"
      # Supported languages: csharp, cpp, go, java, javascript, python, ruby, swift
      # You can customize the initialize task: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/advanced-security-codeql-init-v1?view=azure-pipelines
      # If you're using a self-hosted agent to run CodeQL, use `enableAutomaticCodeQLInstall` to automatically use the latest CodeQL bits on your agent:
      enableAutomaticCodeQLInstall: true

#   Add your custom build steps here
# - Ensure that all code to be scanned is compiled (often using a `clean` command to ensure you're building from a clean state).
# - Disable the use of any build caching mechanisms as this can interfere with CodeQL's ability to capture all the necessary data during the build.
# - Disable the use of any distributed/multithreaded/incremental builds as CodeQL needs to monitor executions of the compiler to construct an accurate representation of the application.
# - For dependency scanning, ensure you have a package restore step for more accurate results.

# If you had a Maven app:
#   - task: Maven@4
#     inputs:
#       mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
#       goals: 'clean package'
#       publishJUnitResults: true
#       testResultsFiles: '**/TEST-*.xml'
#       javaHomeOption: 'JDKVersion'
#       jdkVersionOption: '1.17'
#       mavenVersionOption: 'Default'

# Or a general script:
#   - script: |
#       echo "Run, Build Application using script"
#       ./location_of_script_within_repo/buildscript.sh

  - task: AdvancedSecurity-Dependency-Scanning@1 # More details on this task: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/advanced-security-dependency-scanning-v1?view=azure-pipelines

  - task: AdvancedSecurity-Codeql-Analyze@1 # More details on this task: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/advanced-security-codeql-analyze-v1?view=azure-pipelines

```

> [!TIP]
> CodeQL analysis for Kotlin/Swift is currently in beta. During the beta, analysis of these languages is less comprehensive than CodeQL analysis of others.
> - Use `java` to analyze code written in Java, Kotlin or both.
> - Use `javascript` to analyze code written in JavaScript, TypeScript, or both. 

If the language specified is `cpp, java, csharp` or `swift`, custom build steps are required.


#### [Classic](#tab/classic)

Add the tasks in the following order: 
1. `Advanced Security Initialize CodeQL`
1. Add your own custom build steps
1. `Advanced Security Perform CodeQL Analysis`

:::image type="content" source="media/code-scanning-config-classic-tasks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of code scanning pipeline setup for YAML." lightbox="media/code-scanning-config-classic-tasks.png" :::

Also, specify which language you're analyzing in the `Initialize CodeQL` task. If the language specified is `cpp, java, csharp` or `swift`,  custom build steps are required.

If you're running on a self-hosted agent, select the `Enable automatic CodeQL detection and installation` to automatically use the latest CodeQL bits on your agent if you didn't manually install the latest CodeQL bundle to your agent tool cache.

To generate alerts, run your first scan with a pipeline with the code scanning tasks included.

## Set up pull request annotations 

For both dependency scanning and code scanning, annotations automatically configure for pull requests where a build validation policy applies with dependency scanning and/or code scanning tasks included in your pipeline. For more information on configuring build validation policies, see [Build validation](../git/branch-policies.md#build-validation).

Pull request annotations also require an Advanced Security scan on your default branch and target branch before then scanning your source (pull request) branch. For more information on resolving alerts for pull request branches, see [Managing dependency scanning alerts on pull requests](github-advanced-security-dependency-scanning.md#managing-dependency-scanning-alerts-on-pull-requests) and [Managing code scanning alerts on pull requests](github-advanced-security-code-scanning.md#managing-code-scanning-alerts-on-pull-requests).

To disable Advanced Security, any alerts and state of alerts get retained in the Advanced Security tab for the next time you re-enable Advanced Security for your repository.
