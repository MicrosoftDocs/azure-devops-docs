# Sign up for free and invite others to collaborate on your project

[!INCLUDE [acquisition-intro-devops](../../includes/acquisition-intro-devops.md)]

<a name="MicrosoftAccount"></a>

[!INCLUDE [sign-up-msft-account](../../includes/sign-up-msft-account.md)]

<a name="GitHubAccount"></a>

## Create a project 

If you signed up for Azure DevOps with an existing MSA or GitHub identity, you're automatically prompted to create a project. You can create either a public or private project. To learn more about public projects, see [What is a public project?](../../organizations/public/about-public-projects.md). 

1. Enter a name for your project, select the visibility, and optionally provide a description. Then choose **Create project**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Create a project.](../../boards/get-started/media/sign-up/nf-create-project.png)

    The name can't contain special characters (such as `/ : \ ~ & % ; @ ' " ? < > | # $ * } { , + = [ ]`), can't begin with an underscore, can't begin or end with a period, and must be 64 characters or less.

    Any one can view public projects. With private projects, only people who you give access to the project can view it.
