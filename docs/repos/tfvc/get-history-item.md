# Get the history of an item

#### Azure Repos | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

One advantage of a version control system is that you can look back in time to get detailed information about what changes have been made to your files. Team Foundation version control maintains historical data related to every version of every file that has ever been checked in.

Often when you look over the history of a file, folder, or branch, you are trying to solve a problem or answer a question. By using the Team Foundation version control **History** window, you can more easily resolve questions and situations such as the following:

-   What changes have been made in the past weeks or months?

-   What work item was completed by this change to the file?

-   Who checked in this change? What did they say about the change? What did they change?

-   Unexpected changes occurred in this file, causing a bug in an area of the product that we thought was stable. Who made this change, and why did they make it?

-   A change in this branch fixes a bug that also needed to be fixed in other branches. How can I make sure that the change was merged to those branches?

Use the **History** window to get detailed historical data about a project, branch, folder, or file.

**Required permissions**

You must be one of the **Contributors** for your project. See [Team Foundation Server default groups, permissions, and roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms253077).

To display the History window:

-   In [Source Control Explorer](use-source-control-explorer-manage-files-under-version-control.md), select an item, open its shortcut menu, and then choose **View History**.

	> [!TIP]
	> You can customize the position of the window by right-clicking the title and then choosing one of these options: **Float**, **Dock**, or **Dock as Tabbed Document**.

-   Use the [History Command](history-command.md).

The **History** window displays the historical data about the item in two tabs:

-   The [Changesets tab](get-history-item.md#changesets_tab) lists every change (including edits, renames, and merges) made to the item.

-   The [Labels tab](get-history-item.md#labels_tab) lists every label that has been applied to the item.

<a name="changesets_tab"><a/>

## Changesets Tab

The **Changesets** tab displays detailed data about every change that has been made to an item. All changesets that have modified the item are listed in a table that includes the following columns:

-   **Changeset**   The ID of the changeset.

-   **User**   The name of the user who checked in the changeset.

-   **Date**   The date and time the changeset was checked in.

-   **Comment**   The comment entered by the user who checked in the changeset.

> [!NOTE]
> If you open this window by using the **History** command and you are displaying data about a project, branch, or folder, then the history of children items (for example, the files contained by a folder) is shown only if you use the **/recursive** option.

If the item is a file, then additional data is displayed in the following columns:

-   **Change**   The types of changes that were made to the file with the changeset. Examples of values that can appear in this column include **add**, **edit**, **rename**, and **merge**.

-   **Path**  The path to the file.

> [!TIP]
> Sometimes you need to share this kind of data with someone else. You can select one or more rows from the table in the **Labels** tab, right-click them, click **Copy** to copy the data to the clipboard, and then paste the data into an e-mail message, document, or spreadsheet.

### Common Tasks

By using the **Changesets** tab, you can perform the following tasks:
