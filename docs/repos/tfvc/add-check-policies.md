# Add Check-In Policies

#### Azure Repos | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

Administrators of Team Foundation version control can add check-in policy requirements. These check-in policies require the user to take actions when they conduct a check-in to source control, for example a user can be required to associate a work item with a changeset. For more information about check-ins, see [Check In Pending Changes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181411). By default, the following check-in policy types are available:

-   **Builds**   Requires that the last build was successful before a check-in.

-   **Code Analysis**   Requires that code analysis is run before check-in.

-   **Work Items**   Requires that one or more work items be associated with the check-in.

**Required Permissions**

To complete this procedure, you must have the **Edit project-level information** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

> Visual Studio 2017 : Check-in policies in Visual Studio 2017 must be set through Team Explorer, tf.exe, or [through registry keys declared in the pkgdef of a Visual Studio extension](/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/createpkgdef-utility). Policies only apply to a single installation of Visual Studio 2017 on your computer. If you have multiple installations of Visual Studio 2017, you'll need to set the check-in policy on each installation.

Procedure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


### To create a check-in policy

1.  From Team Explorer, select the **Settings** page, then select  **Source Control** under the **Project** section.

    The **Source Control Settings** dialog box appears.

2.  Click the **Check-in Policy** tab and then click **Add**.

    The **Add Check-in Policy** dialog box appears.

3.  In the Check-in Policy list, select the policy type you want and then click OK.

    The list includes the following selections:

    -   Select **Builds** if you want to require that a previous build was successful before any new changes can be checked in.

    -   Select **Code Analysis** if you want to require that code analysis is run before code can be checked in. The **Code Analysis Policy Editor** dialog box appears.

        Select the check boxes for the types of code analysis that you want performed. Options are Enforce check-in to only contain files that are part of current solution, **Enforce C/C++ Code Analysis (/analyze)**, and **Enforce Code Analysis For Managed Code**. If you select the **Enforce Code Analysis For Managed Code** check box, select the desired rule settings under **Rule settings for Managed Code Analysis**.

        For more information about how to use code analysis tools, see [Create Code Analysis Check-In Policies](/visualstudio/code-quality/how-to-create-or-update-standard-code-analysis-check-in-policies).

        When you are finished, click **OK**.

    -   If you selected **Work Items**, the policy is added to the list that a work item must be associated with the check in.

4.  When you are satisfied with the settings for the check-in policies, click **OK**; the new check-in policy now displays with future check-ins.
