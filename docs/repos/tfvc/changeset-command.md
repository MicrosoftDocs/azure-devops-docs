For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

## Remarks

You can use the **changeset** command to view the attributes of a changeset and modify its properties. You can use the History command to determine which changeset you want to obtain information about. For more information, see [History Command](history-command.md).

For links to other Team Foundation commands that provide additional information about the items in your Team Foundation version control server and all the workspaces that map to it, see [Informational Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181450).

    User: DOMAIN\JohnG
    Date: 01/21/2004 21:03:45
    Comment:  This check-in fixes issues in several features.  I also refactored some items in buf.c into a new file named bif.c because buf.c was too hard to parse.
    Items:
       $/baz/proj/bif.c           Added
       $/baz/proj/buf.c          Modified, Renamed
    Work Items:
       34527     The "Access Denied" message is not descriptive enough.
       35628     The UI flickers when I press the '8', 'y', 'Ctrl', and 'End' buttons at the same time.
    Check-in Notes:
       Code Reviewer:  ShellM
       Performance Reviewer: ShellM
       Security Reviewer: ShellM
