# Develop your app in Team Foundation version control

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-2013](../../includes/version-vs-gt-2013.md)]

When your codebase is under version control, you can develop your app-create and open files in Solution Explorer and write your code-while version control does other work for you. When you check files in and out, it keeps track of your changes and creates a history of your project.

Having access to the history of a project has additional benefits, such as being able to find (and undo, when necessary) changes you made during a specific time period. You can also see exactly what changes your teammates have made, and how your changes relate to the latest changes on the server.

## Walk through an Agile Developer "Day in the Life"

Are you a new user of Visual Studio and Azure DevOps? Are you wondering how you and your team can get maximum benefit from the most recent version of these tools to build your app?

If so, we suggest you take a few minutes to walk step-by-step through a day in the life of Peter and Julia, two developers at Fabrikam Fiber-a fictitious company that provides cable television and related services. Their team recently adopted Visual Studio and Azure DevOps to manage their code. You'll see examples of how you can check out and update code, suspend work when you're interrupted, request a code review, check in your changes, and perform other tasks.
