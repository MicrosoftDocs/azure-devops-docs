**Requirements:** See [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

    tf stat[us] itemspec [/collection:TeamProjectCollectionUrl]
    [/login:username,[password]]
    ([/workspace:workspacename[;workspaceowner]] 
    | [/shelveset:shelvesetname[;shelvesetowner]])
    [/format:(brief|detailed)] [/recursive][/user:(*|username)]
    [/nodetect]

## Remarks

You can use the **Status** command to view pending changes in the current workspace (for example, the workspace that maps the current directory in the command prompt window) regardless of whether it is a local workspace or a server workspace. You can also use this command to view pending changes in a remote server workspace (for example, changes made by another user on another dev machine) by using the **/collection**, **/user**, and **/workspace** options. However, you cannot view pending changes in a remote local workspace.

Also see: [Decide between using a local or a server workspace](decide-between-using-local-server-workspace.md).

## Examples

In all the following examples, assume that `$/SiteApp/Main/` is mapped to `c:\\code\\SiteApp\\Main\\` in the workspace.

### List all changes in the current workspace

    c:\code\SiteApp\Main\SolutionA\>tf stat

Lists all pending changes in the workspace.

### List all changes in a folder

    c:\code\SiteApp\Main>tf stat SolutionA\*

Lists all pending changes to all items in the SolutionA folder.

### List all changes in a folder and its subfolders

    c:\code\SiteApp\Main>tf stat SolutionA\* /recursive

Lists pending changes to all items in the SolutionA folder, including those in its subfolders).

## Work in Visual Studio

-    [Develop code and manage pending changes](develop-code-manage-pending-changes.md)  Use Visual Studio to view and manage pending changes.

## Tips

-   Most changes you make to files under version control are queued as pending changes in your workspace. See [Develop code and manage pending changes](develop-code-manage-pending-changes.md) and [Create and work with workspaces](create-work-workspaces.md).  
-   You can use the [Difference Command](difference-command.md) to get details about edit changes (changes to the content) in a file.  
-   If you need to set aside changes (and perhaps also want to clean your workspace for another task), use the [Shelve Command](shelve-command.md). For more information about shelvesets, see [Suspend your work and manage your shelvesets](suspend-your-work-manage-your-shelvesets.md).  
-   When you are ready to check in changes to the server, use the [Checkin command](checkin-command.md).
