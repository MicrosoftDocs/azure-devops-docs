# Remove Check-In Policies

#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

Administrators of Team Foundation version control can add check-in policy requirements. These check-in policies require the user to take actions when they conduct a check-in to source control. For example, a user can be required to associate a work item with a changeset. For more information, see [Add Check-In Policies](add-check-policies.md). The following procedure demonstrates how to remove a check-in policy from your project.

**Required Permissions**

To complete this procedure, you must have the **Edit project-level information** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).
## Procedure
### To remove a check-in policy

1.  From the **Team** menu, choose **Project Settings**, and then select **Source Control**.

2.  In the **Source Control Settings** dialog box, choose the **Check-in Policy** tab.

3.  In the policy type list, click the policy type that you want to delete, and click **Remove**.

4.  Click **OK**.
