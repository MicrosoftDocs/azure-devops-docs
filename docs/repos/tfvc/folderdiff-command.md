# Folderdiff Command

#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

Use the **folderdiff** command to display and compare a visual representation of the differences between files in two server folders, in a server folder and a local folder, or in two local folders.

**Required Permissions**

To use the **folderdiff** command, you must have the **Read** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

    tf folderdiff [sourcePath] targetPath [/recursive] [/noprompt] [/collection:TeamProjectCollectionUrl] [/filter:filter] [/filterLocalPathsOnly] [/login:username,[password]] [/view:same,different,sourceOnly,targetOnly]

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><i>sourcePath</i></p></td>

## Remarks
The Command Prompt window displays the output if you specify **/noprompt**. Otherwise, the **Folder Difference** window displays the output. When the system compares the local mapped folder to the server folder to which it is mapped, the output in the **Folder Difference** window includes a list of pending changes. Also, the output in the **Folder Difference** window tells you whether the local folder contains the latest copy or not.

The output displayed in the Command Prompt window lists all the files in the folders in the following five sections:

-   Items that exist only in the server folder.

-   Items that exist only in the local folder.

-   Items that have different contents.

-   Items that have identical contents (you must specify the same argument with the **/view** option).

-   Summary.

### File and Folder Filters

A filter is an ordered list of name masks used to match the name of files and folders to be compared. Each mask can contain the wildcard characters question mark (?) and asterisk (\*). '?' matches exactly one character and '\*' matches zero or more characters. The masks in a filter are delimited by semicolons (;). Folder masks must end in backslash (\\). To specify an exclusion mask, prefix the mask with an exclamation mark (!).

The filter is applied to the file and folder names using the following rules:

-   When both file and folder masks are specified together in a filter, the file masks are separated into a file mask list and the folder masks are separated into the folder mask list. File masks are applied only to file names. Folder masks are applied only to folder names.

-   When the command matches a file or folder name, it compares the name to each mask in the filter in the order it was specified. As soon as the name matches a mask, the name is considered to be a match.

-   If the file masks in the filter contain an inclusion mask, files that do not match any of the file masks are excluded.

-   If the file masks in the filter contain only exclusion masks, files that do not match any of the file masks are included.

-   If the folder masks in the filter contain an inclusion mask, folders that do not match any of the folder masks are excluded.

-   If the folder masks in the filter contain only exclusion masks, folders that do not match any of the folder masks are included.

The following table lists filter name mask examples.

|**Name Mask**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|\*.cs | Matches all C# files. |
|My\*.bmp | Matches all bitmap files that begin with My.|
|!\*.exe | Excludes all executable files.|
|!objd\\ | Excludes all objd folders.|


The following table lists filter examples.

|**Filter**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|\*.cs;!objd\\;!obj\\;!bin\\ | Matches all C# files except those in objd, obj, or bin folders.|
|!\*.resx;!\*.ini;!resources\\;!\*junk\*\\ | Excludes all .resx and .ini files, all files in the resources folder, and all files in any folder that has a name that includes the word junk.|

## Examples
The following example compares the files in the server folder and a local folder. It organizes the files in the localFolder recursively and displays the output in the Command Prompt window.

    C:>tf folderdiff $/serverFolder F:\localFolder /recursive /noprompt
