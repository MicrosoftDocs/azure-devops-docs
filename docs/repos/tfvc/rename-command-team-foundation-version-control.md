# Rename Command (Team Foundation Version Control)

#### Azure Repos | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

The **rename** command changes the name or the path of a file or folder. You can use the **rename** command or the aliases **move** or **ren**, to move a file or folder to a new location.

**Required Permissions**

To use the **rename** command, you have the **Check out** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

## Remarks
You can use the **rename** command of the **tf** command-line utility to move or rename a version-controlled item in your workspace. Use the **rename** command to move multiple files by specifying wildcard characters. The ability to rename multiple version-controlled files or folders, is only available from the command-line.

Use Rename to do the following:

-   Rename the *olditem* to the *newitem*, such as `tf rename 314.cs 315.cs`.

-   Move the *olditem* to a new location in the Team Foundation version control server by providing a *newitem* whose path differs from that of the *olditem*, such as ** **`tf rename 314.cs ..\\newdir\\314.cs`.

If you provide a *newitem* that specifies a non-existent folder, the **rename** command creates the destination folder. If *newitem* is a folder, *olditem* becomes a child of *newitem*.

You cannot rename an item if:

-   You have already deleted it before it was checked in to the same workspace.

-   The new name already exists in the Team Foundation version control server and is not a folder.

-   You have already added, branched, or renamed the pending check-in of the item.

-   The item is mapped in the workspace but not available on the local disk.

-   The item is cloaked.

You can rename an item for which another file of the same name has been added pending check-in but you cannot rename an item that has been branched but not yet checked in. When you rename a file that has pending edits, the edits are preserved.

An item that is explicitly mapped cannot be renamed without first changing the mapping. For example, if there is a working folder mapping of $/ProjectX/MyApp to c:\\MyApp, you cannot rename MyApp. You can rename items under *MyApp* but not *MyApp* itself.

For more information on how to find the **tf** command-line utility, see [Tf Command-Line Utility Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/z51z7zy0).
## Examples
The following example changes the name of 314.c to 1254.c.

    c:\projects>tf rename  314.c  1254.c

The following example renames 314.c to 1254.c and moves it to the newdir folder.

    c:\projects>tf rename 314.c ..\newdir\1254.c

The following example changes the name of Form1.vb to MainPage.vb and applies a lock to it.

    c:\projects>tf rename Form1.vb MainPage.vb /lock:checkin
