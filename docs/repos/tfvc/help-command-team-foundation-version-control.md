# Help command (Team Foundation Version Control)

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-2013](../../includes/version-vs-gt-2013.md)]

The **help** command displays information about syntax for a Team Foundation version control command.

## Prerequisites

Requires installation of a version of Visual Studio on your local computer.  

## Syntax

```
tf help commandname
```

## Parameters

### Argument

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Argument**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   **Description**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   *commandname*
   :::column-end:::

   Specifies a Team Foundation command for which to display help about the syntax.
   :::column-end:::

## Remarks
If you do not know which command you need, type **tf help** for a list of all commands.

If you specify the *commandname* parameter, the command line displays information about the arguments and options for that command. If the system cannot find a match for the *commandname*, it searches for aliases and short names. If it cannot find any matching command, alias, or short name, you will get an error.

The option **/?** is an alias for **help**. If you use the **/?** option together with a command, the system invokes the **help** command and it displays information about syntax.

For more information on how to find the **tf** command-line utility, see [Use Team Foundation version control commands](use-team-foundation-version-control-commands.md).
