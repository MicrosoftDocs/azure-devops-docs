#### Q: Where can I find the URL for my Git repository?

A: You'll find it in the Code page in your project.

1. Sign in to your organization in Azure DevOps and browse to your project or type the project URL directly in your browser. 

* The URL will look like ```https://dev.azure.com/{your_account}/{your_team_project}```

* If you are not sure about your project URL, [Sign in to your Visual Studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=309329) and select your account.

2. Open the Code page from your you project's home page.

3. Select the repository and click on the **clone** action to get the URL.
