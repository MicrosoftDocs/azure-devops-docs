##	Open your project in Visual Studio

1. Before you start, if you haven't already:

   * [Sign up and create your project](../../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md).
   * Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads).

2. Open Visual Studio, from Team Explorer, choose **Manage Connections**, [Connect to a Project...](../../../organizations/projects/connect-to-projects.md#connect-from-visual-studio-or-team-explorer), and connect to the project that contains your repository.
