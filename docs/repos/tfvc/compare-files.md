# Compare files

#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

This article provides a guide for comparing files when using Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC). If you're using Git for version control, see [comparing files with Git and Visual Studio](../../repos/git/review-history.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> Even if you're not using version control, you can use the Diff window in Visual Studio to compare two files. To open the Diff window directly in Visual Studio, you can use the [devenv.exe tool with the /diff option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj874068.aspx) from the Developer Command Prompt to compare any two files on your computer.


## Compare any two files using the Compare dialog 

You can compare any two files using the Compare dialog. The files can both reside on the local system, both on your Team Foundation Server, or one on each.

1.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Other Windows**, **Source Control Explorer**. 

2.  In **Source Control Explorer**, right-click a file and select **Compare**. 

    The **Compare** dialog box appears.

3.  Specify the two files you want to compare - one under **Source Path** and the other under **Target Path**:

    -   Type a path, or open the **Browse** menu, choose **Local Path** or **Server Path**, and then browse to choose the file. 

    -   Choose an option to specify file the server file version when specifying a **Server Path** from the **Type** menu: **Changeset**, **Date**, **Label**, **Latest Version**, or **Workspace Version**. 

    > [!TIP]
    > To compare any two local files, select **Local Path...** from both **Browse...** drop downs in the Compare dialog.
 
4.  Choose **OK**.

## Compare files in your workspace with the most recent version

Compare your work with the latest version on your Team Foundation Server while continuing to make changes.

1.  If you are not already connected to the project that you want to work in, then [connect to the project](../../organizations/projects/connect-to-projects.md).

2.  From **Team Explorer**, open the **Pending Changes** view.

3.  On the **Pending Changes** view, locate the file in the **Included Changes** list. Open the shortcut menu for this file (select the file and right-click), and then:

    -   Choose **Compare with Workspace Version** to see what changes you have made to the version you checked out.

        > [!TIP]
        >  You can also press Ctrl+Shift and then double-click the file.

    -   Choose **Compare with Latest Version** to see how the changes you have made compare to the latest version of the file on your Team Foundation Server.

4.  The Diff window appears. You can continue to make changes to the file in this window.

> [!Tip]
>  You can also use **Solution Explorer** and the **Source Control Explorer** windows to compare the file in your workspace with a version of the file on the server. Select a file, open its shortcut menu (right-click), and then choose **Compare**. When the **Compare** dialog box appears, choose **OK**.

## Compare two versions of a file in your TFVC history

Compare two versions of a file already checked into Team Foundation Version Control:

1.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Other Windows**, **Source Control Explorer**.

2.  In **Source Control Explorer**, right-click a file and select **View History**.

3.  Select two versions of the file, right-click and select **Compare**.


## Use the Diff window

When you compare files using the instructions in the previous sections, Visual Studio displays the files in the Diff window. The Diff window shows the difference between two files. If one of the files is checked out in your workspace, you can modify the file as you run the comparison. 

> [!NOTE]
> Even if you're not using version control, you can use the Diff window in Visual Studio to compare two files. To open the Diff window directly in Visual Studio, you can use the [devenv.exe tool with the /diff option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj874068.aspx) from the Developer Command Prompt to compare any two files on your computer.

Here are some tips for working with the **Diff** window:

-   Although **Side-by-side mode** is generally more effective in most cases, you can use whichever mode works best for you and the code you are examining.

-   To skip:

    -   To the next difference, choose **Next difference** ![Next difference](_img/compare-files/IC558315.gif) (Keyboard: F8).

    -   To the previous difference, choose **Previous difference** ![Previous difference](_img/compare-files/IC558316.gif) (Keyboard: Shift+F8).

    -   Back and forth in the file, choose a section of the ![Step 5](_img/compare-files/IC646328.png) visual summary.

-   When you participate in a [code review](day-life-alm-developer-suspend-work-fix-bug-conduct-code-review.md), you use the **Diff** window to see the code changes that are the subject of the review. For more information, see [Day in the life of a devops Developer: Suspend work, fix a bug, and conduct a code review](day-life-alm-developer-suspend-work-fix-bug-conduct-code-review.md).

## Merge changes between versions

Copy and paste changes from the diff view into the version in your workspace to make quick updates to bring in updates from one version to another.
Merge more complex changes between two versions when you [resolve merge conflicts in TFVC](resolve-team-foundation-version-control-conflicts.md) before making a check-in. 

If you need to merge two files with significant differences outside of TFVC conflict resolution, use the [vsdiffmerge command line tool](https://roadtoalm.com/2013/10/22/use-visual-studio-as-your-diff-and-merging-tool-for-local-files).
The vsdiffmerge tool allows you to merge changes side-by-side and pick which contents you want to keep for each difference between the files.
Run the command with four file parameters followed by the `/m` flag from the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt to bring up the merge tool directly against any two files. 

The basic syntax for vsdiffmerge.exe is:

```   
vsdiffmerge.exe "File1" "File2" "Base file" "Result file" /m
```
   
    
`File1` and `File2` are the full path to the files you want to merge. 
The `Base file` is the full path to the file both files are based off of, and `Result file` is the full path to where you want to write the merged results.

## Use the command prompt

-   [Difference command](difference-command.md) Compare two files from the command prompt.
