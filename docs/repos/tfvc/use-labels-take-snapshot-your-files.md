# Use labels to take a snapshot of your files

#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

Labels let you take a snapshot of your files so that at a later date you can refer back to that snapshot. By using your label, you can view, build, or even roll back a large set of files to the state they were in when you applied the label.

**Required permissions**

To apply a label, you must have the **Label** permission set to **Allow**. To find, list, or view labels, you must have the **Read** permission set to **Allow**. To modify or delete a label, you must own the label or have the **Administer Labels** permission set to **Allow**.


## Using Labels

In many software projects, when the code has reached a reasonable level of quality and stability, the team will build and release a new version of the product. The team needs to mark the current version of each file so that even as the files continue to change, the team can still get and build the new version of every file in their project.

Theoretically, you could record the ID of each changeset for each file manually; but clearly this kind of process is not practical. Team Foundation version control makes the job simple: You apply a label to the folder, branch, or project that contains the files. You can give the label a name that follows whatever naming convention you prefer. Some examples of label names include: "Sprint 5", "M1", "Beta2", and "Release Candidate 0".

After you have applied the label, you can use it to qualify operations such as building, branching, merging, comparing, and getting specific versions of files and folders.

Sometimes after you apply a label you decide that you need to change it. Team Foundation version control enables you to apply a label to additional files, remove a label from certain files, and even to modify which version of a specific file to which the label applies.

> [!TIP]
> Applying a label provides many of the same benefits as creating a branch, but typically with lower cost and complexity. The tradeoff is that for large databases, operations such as merging may take much longer when running against a label.

## Apply a Label

> [!TIP]
> When you use Visual Studio to apply a label that already exists, the operation removes the label from all file versions and then applies the label. From the command prompt, however, the label operation is additive. See [Label Command (Team Foundation Version Control)](label-command-team-foundation-version-control.md).

### Apply a label

1.  In **Source Control Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the collection, project, branch, folder, or file to which you want to apply a label and choose **Advanced**, **Apply Label**.

    The **New Label** dialog box appears.

2.  In the **Name** box, type a name for the label.

3.  (Optional) Type your comments in the **Comment** box.

4.  In the **Version** list, **Latest Version** is selected by default. This option is the one most typically used, but if you need the label to target a specific version, select:

    -   **Changeset**: Specify the number of the changeset in the **Changeset** box. Alternatively, choose the ellipses (**...**) to open the **Find Changesets** dialog box. For more information, see [Find and view changesets](find-view-changesets.md).

    -   **Date**: Specify a date in the **Date** box or select a date from the calendar on the drop-down menu.

    -   **Label**: Specify an existing label upon which to base the new label. Either type the label name in the **Label** box, or choose the ellipses (**...**) to open the **Find Label** dialog box. For more information, see [Find, Edit, and Remove Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#find_label).

    -   **Workspace Version**: The label is created for the version in your workspace.

5.  When you are satisfied with your settings, perform one of the following steps:

    -   To apply the label, choose **Create**.

    -   To apply the label and then modify it after it has been applied, choose **Create and Edit**. This applies the label and then displays the **Label** window. For more information about using the **Label** window to edit a label, see [Use the Label Window to Work with Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#label_window).

> [!NOTE]
> When you apply a label using a name that already exists, the system warns you and asks if you want to continue. If you choose **OK** to continue, any items not contained in the path to which you are applying the label will no longer have that label.

## Rename a Label

While you cannot modify the name of an existing label, you can easily apply a new label to exactly the same files and same versions to which another label applies.

### Apply a label based on an existing label

1.  In Source Control Explorer, open the shortcut menu for the project collection node (the root node), and then choose **Advanced**, **Apply Label**.

    The **New Label** dialog box appears.

2.  In the **Name** box, type a name for the label.

3.  (Optional) In the **Comment** box, type a comment.

4.  In **Version** list, select **Label**.

    The **Label** box appears.

5.  Perform one of the following steps:

    -   Type the name of the existing label.

    -   If you are not sure of the name of the existing label, choose the browse button with the ellipses (...) next to the **Label** box.

        The **Find Label** dialog box appears.

        Use the options in the **Find Label** dialog box to filter the list of labels and find the existing label to which you want to apply the new label. (For more information, see [Find, Edit, and Remove Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#find_label).)

6.  Choose **Create**.

7.  (Optional) After you have created the new label, you can remove the old label. For more information, see [Find, Edit, and Remove Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#find_label).

## List, Find, View, Edit and Remove Labels

There are two ways to list and find labels: the **Find Label** dialog box and the **Label** tab in the **History** window. After you find the label you are interested in, you can then view it, edit it, remove it, or work with the files to which it applies.

### Find and work with labels by using the Find Label dialog box

1.  In Source Control Explorer, on the menu bar choose **File**, **Source Control**, **Find**, **Find Label**.

    The **Find Label** dialog box appears.

2.  (Optional) Refine your search by performing one or more of the following steps:

    -   In the **Name** text box, type the name of the label.

    -   In the **Project** list, select the project that contains the label that you want to find.

    -   In the **Owner** text box, type the name or alias of the owner of the label.

3.  Choose **Find**.

    The **Results** list displays labels that match the search criteria that you entered.

4.  (Optional) Perform one of the following steps:

    -   To view or edit a label, select it and choose **Edit**.

        The **Label** window appears. For more information, see [Use the Label Window to Work with Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#label_window).

    -   To delete a label, select it and choose **Delete**.

    -   Choose **Close**.

Sometimes you may not be sure of the name of a label, but you know that the label was applied to a particular item under version control. The following procedure explains how to find and then work with a label in this situation.

### List and work with labels that apply to a specific item

1.  In Source Control Explorer, open the shortcut menu for the item to which the label you want to find applies, and then choose **View History**.

    The **History** window appears.

2.  Choose the **Labels** tab to display the list of labels that apply to this item.

3.  (Optional) Perform one of the following steps:

    -   To view or edit a label, open its shortcut menu and choose **Edit Label**.

        The Label window appears. For information about how to use this window, see [Use the Label Window to Work with Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#label_window).

    -   To delete a label, open its shortcut menu and choose **Delete Label**.

    -   Open the shortcut menu for the label and choose other actions such as **Get This Version**, and **Compare**.

For more information about how to use the label tab in the History window, see [Get the history of an item](get-history-item.md).

## Download Labeled Versions of Files to Your Workspace

Labeling a set of files is like taking a snapshot of how they existed at a certain point in time. Weeks or months after you have taken this snapshot, you may need to view or work with the files as they existed in that snapshot. The following procedure explains how to download the labeled versions of a set of files to your workspace.

### Download labeled versions of files to your workspace

1.  In Source Control Explorer, open the shortcut menu for the project collection, project, branch, or folder that contains the items you want to download and then choose **Advanced**, **Get Specific Version**.

    The **Get** dialog box appears.

2.  From the **Type** list, select **Label**, and then either type the label name in the **Label** box, or choose the ellipses (**...**) to open the **Find Label** dialog box. For more information about how to use this dialog box, see [Find, Edit, and Remove Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#find_label).

3.  Review, and if appropriate, select any of the additional options in the **Get** dialog box.

4.  Choose **Get**.

## Use the Label Window to Work with Labels

After you have opened the Label window by using one of the preceding procedures, you are ready to begin working with the label. At the top of the window is a box that displays the comment, which you can edit if you want.

You can use the Label window to perform the following tasks:

-   Add an item to the label

-   Remove an item from the label

-   Change the version of a file

-   Perform other actions on an item

### Add an item to the label

1.  In the **Label** window, choose **Add Item**.

    The **Choose Item Version** dialog box appears.

2.  In the **Choose Item Version** dialog box, navigate to and then select the item that you want to add.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can press and hold the CONTROL or SHIFT keys and then select multiple items.

3.  (Optional) If you need the label to target a specific version, from the **Version** list, select:

    -   **Latest Version**: The label will be applied to the latest version that is in version control.

    -   **Changeset**: Specify the number of the changeset in the **Changeset** box. Alternatively, choose the ellipses (**...**) to open the **Find Changesets** dialog box. For more information, see [Find and view changesets](find-view-changesets.md).

    -   **Date**: Specify a date in the **Date** box or select a date from the calendar on the drop-down menu.

    -   **Label**: Specify an existing label upon which to base the new label. Either type the label name in the **Label** box, or choose the ellipses (**...**) to open the **Find Label** dialog box. For more information, see [Find, Edit, and Remove Labels](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md#find_label).

    -   **Workspace Version**: The label is created for the version in your workspace.

4.  Choose **OK**.

5.  Choose **File**, **Save**.

### Remove an item from the label

1.  In the **Label** window, locate the collection, project, branch, folder, or file that you want to remove from this label.

2.  Open the shortcut menu for the item and choose **Remove from Label**.

    The label is removed from the item. If the item is a project collection, project, branch, or folder, then the label is also removed from all the items it contains.

3.  Choose **File**, **Save**.

### Change the version of a file

1.  In the **Label** window, locate the file that you want to modify.

2.  Open the shortcut menu for the file and choose **Change Labeled Version**.
