## Remarks
The **view** command of the **tf** command-line utility retrieves a read-only copy of a file from the Team Foundation version control server to a temporary folder on your computer and displays its contents. Unless you specify a particular version, Team Foundation retrieves the latest version of the file from the Team Foundation version control server.

The **view** command does not retrieve files into your workspace or check them out. See [Get Command](get-command.md) and [Checkout and Edit Commands](checkout-or-edit-command.md) for more information about how to get the Team Foundation version control server version of and check out files.

You can use the [Difference Command](difference-command.md) to view the differences between two versions of a file.

For more information on how to find the **tf** command-line utility, see [Tf Command-Line Utility Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/z51z7zy0).

### Output Options

By default, Team Foundation displays the contents of the file in the viewer associated with its file type.

If you include the **/console** option, Team Foundation prints the contents of the file to the command console. Likewise, if Team Foundation cannot locate a viewer for the type of file you have specified, it prints the contents of the file to the command console.

Finally, you can redirect the contents of a file to standard out using **|** or **\>** in order to save it in another file or pass it to another program for post-processing.
## Examples
The following example displays the latest version of the file 314.c.

    c:\projects>tf view 314.c

The following example displays the version of 314.c that was checked in with changeset 1999.

    c:\projects>tf view /version:C1999 314.c

The following example retrieves version 5 of 314.c and writes it to the file 314.old.

    c:\projects>tf view /version:5 314.c > 314.old

The following example displays the latest version of each file that matches the wildcard "\*.cs".

    c:\projects>tf view *.cs
