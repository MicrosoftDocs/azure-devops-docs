# Undelete Command

#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

The **undelete** command restores items that were previously deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> The results of this command are not visible in other workspaces until you perform a check-in operation. For more information, see [Check In Pending Changes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181411).

**Required Permissions**

To use the **undelete** command, you must have the **Check out** permission set to **Allow**. If you include the **/lock** option with a value other than none, you must have the **Lock** permission set to **Allow**. Additionally, you must own the workspace or have the global **Administer workspaces** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

## Parameters

| **Argument** |                                                                                                                 **Description**                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  *itemspec*  | Identifies the file or folder to undelete. For more information about how Team Foundation parses itemspecs to determine which items are within scope, see [Command-Line Syntax (Version Control)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/56f7w6be). |
| *deletionID* |                                                                           Specifies a unique identifier that disambiguates multiple deleted items with the same name.                                                                           |
|  *username*  |                                                            Provides a value to the **/login** option. You can specify a username value as either *DOMAIN*\*UserName\* or *UserName*.                                                            |

## Remarks
The Undelete command of the tf command-line feature schedules specified files or folders for restoration pending the completion of a check-in operation. It also retrieves the specified items from the server to the local disk unless you explicitly include the **/noget** option.

When files or folders that have the same name have been deleted from the same server folder, you must include a value for the *deletionID* parameter to indicate which of the deleted items that you want to restore. You can obtain a *deletionID* using the **dir** command.

If you want to change the file after restoring it, you may check out the file for editing with the checkout command as usual.

When your *itemspec* specifies a folder, Team Foundation restores all its files and subfolders and the files they contain, by default. If you do not want to restore all the items in a folder, you must first undelete the folder and its items and then delete the items that you do not want to keep.

For more information on how to find the **tf** command-line utility, see [Tf Command-Line Utility Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/z51z7zy0).
## Examples
The following example restores 314.cs to the server folder from which 314.cs was deleted and retrieves a read-only copy of the latest version in the current workspace.

    C:\projects>tf undelete c:\math\314.cs

The following example displays deletion IDs for all items on the server that have been deleted more than one time.

    c:\projects>tf dir $/ /deleted

-   Sample output:

		$/projects/math/314.cs;X10
        $/projects/math/314.cs;X11

The following example restores the X11 version of 314.cs to the server folder from which the file was deleted and retrieves a read-only copy of the latest version in the current workspace.

    c:\projects>tf undelete 314.cs;X11
