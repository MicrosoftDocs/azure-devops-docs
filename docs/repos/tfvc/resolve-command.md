# Resolve Command

#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

Lets you resolve conflicts between changed items in your workspace and the latest or destination versions of items on the server.

**Required Permissions**

To use the **resolve** command, you must be either the workspace owner or have the global **Administer workspaces** permission set to **Allow**. You must also have the **Read** and **Check out** permissions for the items involved in a resolve operation set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

    tf resolve [itemspec] 
    [/auto:(AutoMerge|TakeTheirs|KeepYours|OverwriteLocal|DeleteConflict|KeepYoursRenameTheirs)] 
    [/preview] [(/overridetype:overridetype | /converttotype:converttype] [/recursive] [/newname:path] [/noprompt] [/login:username, [password]]

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><strong>/auto</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Resolves outstanding conflicts between different versions of specified items in the current workspace using one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>AutoMerge</strong>   Automatically reconciles non-overlapping content differences between the specified workspace version of an item and the latest server version.</p>
<p>If differences cannot be reconciled automatically, either because the file is binary or because the workspace and server versions contain overlapping content changes, the conflict remains unresolved pending the selection of one of the following manual merge options.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>TakeTheirs</strong> option instructs Team Foundation Server to overwrite workspace revisions with the server revision. Further, for conflicts generated by running the <strong>Merge</strong> command, this option accepts the changes from the source of the merge and overwrites the changes in the target.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>KeepYours</strong> option instructs Team Foundation Server to keep your changes and discard the changes in the server version of an item. For conflicts generated by running the <strong>Merge</strong> command, this option discards the changes from the source of the merge and leaves the target unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>OverwriteLocal</strong> option overwrites the file in your workspace with the server version. This is used to resolve conflicts that arise from a writable file in your workspace.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>DeleteConflict</strong> option removes a conflict from the conflict table, and the option/description table.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>KeepYoursRenameTheirs</strong> option accepts the contents and name of your file and renames their file to a new name that the user specifies. This option requires a single-item filespec, and the <strong>/newname</strong> option must also be included.</p></li>

<tr>
<td><p><strong>/overridetype</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Specifies optional encoding for files involved in a three-way merge. The files are treated as the specified encoding. You must determine the correct encoding. Team Foundation Server saves the resulting merge output in the specified encoding in your workspace. For more information about file encodings, see <a href="/azure/devops/server/admin/manage-file-types">Managing File Types</a>.</p>

## Remarks
You can use the <strong>Resolve</strong> command to select a resolution for pending changes that conflict with the server version.

If version conflicts are detected between your version and the version on the destination server during a get, check-in, or merge operation, a prompt appears for you to select a conflict resolution using the **resolve** command. You must resolve conflicts before you can check in your pending changes.

For more information on how to find the **tf** command-line utility, see [Tf Command-Line Utility Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/z51z7zy0).
## Examples
The following example invokes the **Resolve Conflicts** dialog box so that you can tell Team Foundation Server how to deal with pending changes that conflict with the server version.

    tf resolve

The following example attempts to resolve all conflicts by automatically merging the changes.

    tf resolve /auto:automerge
