# Resolve command (Team Foundation Version Control)

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-vs-gt-eq-2019.md)]

The Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) `tf resolve` command lets you resolve conflicts between changed items in your workspace and the latest or destination versions of items on the server.

## Prerequisites

To use the `resolve` command, you must be either the workspace owner or have the global **Administer workspaces** permission set to **Allow**. You must also have the **Read** and **Check out** permissions for the items involved in a resolve operation set to **Allow**.  For more information, see  [Default TFVC permissions](../../organizations/security/default-tfvc-permissions.md).

## Syntax

```
tf resolve [itemspec] 
[/auto:(AutoMerge|TakeTheirs|KeepYours|OverwriteLocal|DeleteConflict|KeepYoursRenameTheirs)] 
[/preview] [(/overridetype:overridetype | /converttotype:converttype] [/recursive] [/newname:path] [/noprompt] [/login:username, [password]]
```

   `<itemspec>`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Used to identify the file or folder for which to resolve version conflicts. If omitted, all items with conflicts are included. For more information about how TFVC parses the `itemspec` to determine which items are within scope, see [Use Team Foundation version control commands](use-team-foundation-version-control-commands.md).
   > [!Note]  
   > You can specify more than one `itemspec` argument.

:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `<converttype>`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Used with the `/converttotype` option. Specifies the encoding type, such as `unicode`.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `<path>`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Used with the `/newname` option. Specifies the new path of the affected file or folder.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `<username>`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Provides a value to the `/login` option. You can specify a user name value as either `DOMAIN\username` or `username`.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Options

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Option**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   **Description**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/auto`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Resolves outstanding conflicts between different versions of specified items in the current workspace by using one of the following options.
   
   If differences can't be reconciled automatically, either because the file is binary or because the workspace and server versions contain overlapping content changes, the conflict remains unresolved pending the selection of one of the manual merge options.

   - `AutoMerge`: Automatically reconciles non-overlapping content differences between the specified workspace version of an item and the latest server version.

   - `TakeTheirs` instructs TFVC to overwrite workspace revisions with the server revision. For conflicts generated by running the `merge` command, this option accepts the changes from the source of the merge and overwrites the changes in the target.

   - `KeepYours` instructs TFVC to keep your changes and discard the changes in the server version of an item. For conflicts generated by running the `merge` command, this option discards the changes from the source of the merge and leaves the target unchanged.

   - `OverwriteLocal` overwrites the file in your workspace with the server version. You can use this option to resolve conflicts that arise from a writable file in your workspace.

   - `DeleteConflict` removes a conflict from the conflict table and the option/description table.

   - `KeepYoursRenameTheirs` accepts the contents and name of your file and renames their file to a new name that you specify. This option requires a single-item filespec, and you must also include the `/newname` option.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/preview`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Displays current conflicts but does nothing with them.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/overridetype`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Specifies optional encoding for files involved in a three-way merge. The files are treated as the specified encoding. You must determine the correct encoding. TFVC saves the resulting merge output in the specified encoding in your workspace. For more information about file encodings, see [Manage file types](/azure/devops/server/admin/manage-file-types).

   > [!Note]  
   > You can't specify both an `/overridetype` and a `/converttotype`.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/converttotype`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Specifies the encoding used for temporary conversion for the input in a three-way merge operation. The merge output is saved in the specified encoding in your workspace. This option is an advanced option and seldom used. For more information about file encodings, see [Manage file types](/azure/devops/server/admin/manage-file-types).

   > [!Note]  
   > You can't specify both an `/overridetype` and a `/converttotype`.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/recursive`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Resolves items in the specific directory and subdirectories.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/newname`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Resolves a name collision conflict. Can only be used in conjunction with `AutoMerge` and `KeepYoursRenameTheirs`. With `AutoMerge`, `/newname` is only valid with conflicts that involve rename and/or undelete. If used, you must supply a new `path`.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/login`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Specifies the user name and password to authenticate the user with Azure DevOps.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   `/noprompt`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Suppresses any prompts for input.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Remarks

You can use the `resolve` command to select a resolution for pending changes that conflict with the server version.

If version conflicts are detected between your version and the version on the destination server during a get, check-in, or merge operation, a prompt appears for you to select a conflict resolution by using the `resolve` command. You must resolve conflicts before you can check in your pending changes.

For more information on how to use the `tf` command-line utility, see [Use Team Foundation version control commands](use-team-foundation-version-control-commands.md).

## Examples

The following example opens the **Resolve Conflicts** dialog box in Visual Studio so you can tell TFVC how to deal with pending changes that conflict with the server version.

```
tf resolve
```

The following example attempts to resolve all conflicts by automatically merging the changes.

```
tf resolve /auto:automerge
```
