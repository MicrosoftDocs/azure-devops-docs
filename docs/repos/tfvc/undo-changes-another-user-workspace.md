#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

If a team member is blocked from checking in a file that is locked by someone else, you can use the **tf undo** command to delete Team Foundation version control pending changes in another user's workspace.

If you must also remove an exclusive lock on a file, but not the pending changes, you can use the **tf lock** command. For more information, see [Lock Command](lock-command.md).

If you must also delete another user's workspace, you can use the **tf workspace** command. For more information, see [Remove a Workspace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms245474).

**Required Permissions**

To undo pending changes in another user's workspace, you must have the **Administer workspaces** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../../organizations/security/permissions.md).

### To Undo the Changes in Another User's Workspace

1.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Visual Studio 2010**, point to **Visual Studio Tools**, and then click **Visual Studio 10.0 Command Prompt**.

2.  Type the following command at the command prompt and replace the arguments with the appropriate parameter information for your needs:

    `tf undo /workspace:OtherUserWorkspace;OtherUser $/TeamProject/MyFile.cs /collection:http://YourTFSServer:8080/tfs/YourCollection`

For more information, see [Undo Command](undo-command.md).
