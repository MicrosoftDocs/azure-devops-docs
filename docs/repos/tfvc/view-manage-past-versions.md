# View and manage past versions

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-eq-2019.md](../../includes/version-vs-gt-eq-2019.md)]

One advantage of building your app under version control is that you can look back in time to get detailed information about what changes have been made to your files. Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) maintains historical data related to every version of every file that has ever been checked in.

## What do you want to do?

- [Get the history of an item](get-history-item.md).
  Get detailed information about what changes have been made to your files.

- [View file changes using annotate](view-file-changes-using-annotate.md).
  Annotate a file to learn who made changes and what changes they made in all earlier versions of the file.

- [Use labels to take a snapshot of your files](use-labels-take-snapshot-your-files.md).
  Use labels to take a snapshot of your files so that you can easily refer back to that snapshot at a later date.

- [Find and view changesets](find-view-changesets.md).
  Get detailed information about past changes by looking at a changeset. Changesets make up the history of each item in version control.

- [Roll back changesets](roll-back-changesets.md).
  Roll back the effects of one or more changesets.
