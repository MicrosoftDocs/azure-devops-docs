# Rollback command (Team Foundation Version Control)

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-2013](../../includes/version-vs-gt-2013.md)]

You can use this command to roll back the effects of one or more changesets to one or more version-controlled items. This command does not remove the changesets from an item's version history. Instead, this command creates in your workspace a set of pending changes that negate the effects of the changesets that you specify.

## Prerequisites

To use this command, you must have the **Read**, **Check Out**, and **Check In** permissions set to **Allow**. For more information, see  [Default TFVC permissions](../../organizations/security/default-tfvc-permissions.md).

## Syntax

```
tf rollback /toversion:VersionSpec ItemSpec [/recursive] [/lock:none|checkin|checkout] [/version:versionspec] [/keepmergehistory] [/login:username,[password]] [/noprompt]
```

```
tf rollback /changeset:ChangesetFrom~ChangesetTo [ItemSpec] [/recursive] [/lock:none|checkin|checkout] [/version:VersionSpec]
[/keepmergehistory] [/noprompt] [/login:username,[password]]
```

### Option

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Option**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   **Description**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **/changeset**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Use this option to specify one or more specific changesets that you want to negate.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **/keepmergehistory**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   This option has an effect only if one or more of the changesets that you are rolling back include a **branch** or **merge** change. Specify this option if you want future merges between the same source and the same target to exclude the changes that you are rolling back.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **/lock**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Specify this option to prevent other users from checking in or checking out items until you finish rolling back all associated changes. For more information, see [Understanding Lock Types](./understand-lock-types.md).

   Lock Options
   - **None**
    
     Default. No lock is applied. If the file that you are rolling back has been locked, this option removes the lock.
   - **Checkin**
    
     Locks an item until you release the lock by performing a check-in. Other users can check out the specified items, but the users cannot check in revisions until the lock is removed. You cannot lock a file that is already locked.
   - **Checkout**
     
     Prevents users from checking in or out a locked item until you remove the lock by performing a check-in. 
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Remarks

The **tf rollback** command negates the effect of each changeset that you specify for each item that you specify. The following table lists how the operation negates each kind of change.

|**If you roll back this change...**|**...a rollback change and the following additional change are made**|
|---|---|
|**add**, **branch**, or **undelete**|**delete**|
|**edit**|**edit**|
|**encoding**|**encoding**|
|**rename/move**|**rename/move**|
|**delete**|**undelete**|
|**merge**|Change that negates whatever changes were merged into the current branch.|

The following list provides some examples of changes that result from the rollback command:

-   If you are rolling back a changeset in which an **add** change occurred, the rollback operation causes a **rollback** change and a **delete** change.

-   If you are rolling back changeset 521 in which an **edit** change occurred, the rollback operation causes a **rollback** change and an **edit** change that negates the changes encompassed by the **edit** change in changeset 521.

-   In changeset 132, you merged from **$/BranchA/File1.txt** to **$/BranchB/File1.txt**. The changes included in that merge included **edit** changes in changesets 92 and 104. In changeset 162, you roll back changeset 132, which results in a **rollback** change and an **edit** change to **$/BranchB/File1.txt** that negates the edit changes in changesets 92 and 104.

### Exit Codes

The exit codes in the following table appear after you run the **tf rollback** command.

|**Exit Code**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|0|The operation rolled back all items successfully.|
|1|The operation rolled back at least one item successfully but could not roll back one or more items.|
|100|The operation could not roll back any items.|

## Examples
The following example negates the effect of changeset **23** on all items that were changed in that changeset.

```
c:\workspace> tf rollback /changeset:C23
```

The following example negates the effect of changeset 23 on the file **a.txt**.

```
c:\workspace> tf rollback /changeset:C23 a.txt
```

The following example changes the content of **a.txt** to match the version that was checked in with changeset 23.

```
c:\workspace> tf rollback /toversion:C23 a.txt
```

The following example changes the content of **OurTeamProject** to match the last changeset that was applied on or before midnight on August 31, 2009.

```
c:\workspace> tf rollback /toversion:D08/31/2009 /recursive $/OurTeamProject/
```

## Example: /keepmergehistory Option
When you roll back a changeset that includes a branch or a merge change, you usually want future merges between the same source and the same target to include those changes. However, you can use the **/keepmergehistory** option if you want future merges between the same source and the same target to exclude changesets that were encompassed in a past merge operation.

For example, you can use this command in the following situation:

1.  In On June 30, 2009, you perform a full merge of all items from **$/BranchA/** to **$/BranchB/**:

    ```
	c:\workspace> tf merge $/BranchA $/BranchB
    ```

    You check in this merge as part of changeset 292.

2.  In July, you make several changes **$/BranchA/Util.cs**. These changes are encompassed in changesets 297, 301, and 305.

3.  On August 1, 2009, you merge **$/BranchA/Util.cs** to **$/BranchB/Util.cs**:

    ```
	c:\workspace> tf merge $/BranchA/Util.cs $/BranchB/Util.cs
    ```

    You check in the change as part of changeset 314. The result of this operation is that the edits that you made in changesets 297, 301, and 305 to **$/BranchA/Util.cs** are now also applied to **$/BranchB/Util.cs**.

4.  A week later, you realize that the edits that you made to **$/BranchA/Util.cs** in July are not appropriate for **$/BranchB/Util.cs**. You can use the rollback command to negate these changes. When you use the rollback command to roll back a **merge** change or a **branch** change, you have a decision to make.

    -   If you want the changes that you made in July to **$/BranchA/Util.cs** to be re-applied to **$/BranchB/Util.cs** in future merges, you should type the following command:

        ```
		c:\workspace> tf rollback /changeset:314
        ```

    -   If you want the changes that you made in July to **$/BranchA/Util.cs** to never be re-applied to **$/BranchB/Util.cs** in future merges, you should type the following command:

        ```
    	c:\workspace> tf rollback /changeset:314 /keepmergehistory
        ```

5.  A few weeks later, you merge **$/BranchA/** into **$/BranchB/**:

    ```
	c:\workspace> tf merge $/BranchA $/BranchB
    ```

    -   If you omitted the **/keepmergehistory** option, the **merge** change will apply to **$/BranchB/Util.cs** all changesets that were applied to **$/BranchA/Util.cs** since changeset 292, including changesets 297, 301, 305. In other words, a future merge will undo the **rollback** change.

    -   If you included the **/keepmergehistory** option, the merge operation will apply to **$/BranchB/Util.cs** all changesets that were applied to **$/BranchA/Util.cs** since changeset 292, excluding changesets 297, 301, and 305. In other words, a future merge will not undo the rollback change. Therefore, the content on **BranchA** might not match the content on **BranchB**.
