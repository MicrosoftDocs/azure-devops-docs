# Branch policies and settings

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Branch policies help teams protect their important [branches](./create-branch.md) of development. Policies enforce your team's code quality and change management standards. This article describes how to set and manage branch policies. For an overview of all repository and branch policies and settings, see [Git repository settings and policies](repository-settings.md).

A branch that has required policies configured can't be deleted, and requires pull requests (PRs) for all changes.

## Prerequisites 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

- To set branch policies, you must be a member of the Project Administrators security group or have repository-level **Edit policies** permissions. For more information, see [Set Git repository permissions](set-git-repository-permissions.md).

- If you want to use Azure DevOps CLI [az repos policy](/cli/azure/repos/policy) commands to manage branch policies, follow the steps in [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).

## Configure branch policies

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

To manage branch policies, select **Repos** > **Branches** to open the **Branches** page in the web portal.

![Screenshot that shows the Branches menu item.](media/branch-policies/branches-new-nav.png)

You can also get to branch policy settings with **Project Settings** > **Repository** > **Policies** > **Branch Policies** > **\<Branch Name>**.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

Branches that have policies display a policy icon. You can select the icon to go directly to the branch's policy settings.

To set branch policies, locate the branch you want to manage. You can browse the list or search for your branch in the **Search branch name** box at upper right.

Select the **More options** icon next to the branch, and then select **Branch policies** from the context menu.

# [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

You can use Azure DevOps CLI to list or show policies for a branch or repository.

### List policies

To list all policies in a project, use [az repos policy list](/cli/azure/repos/policy#az-repos-policy-list).

```azurecli
az repos policy list [--branch]
                     [--detect {false, true}]
                     [--org]
                     [--project]
                     [--query-examples]
                     [--repository-id]
                     [--subscription]
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`branch`|Branch name to filter results by exact match. The `--repository-id` parameter is required to use the branch filter. For example: `--branch main`.|
|`detect`|Automatically detect organization. Accepted values: `false`, `true`.|
|`org`, `organization`|Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization by using `az devops configure -d organization=<ORG_URL>`. **Required** if not configured as default or picked up via git config. Example: `https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.|
|`project`, `p`|Name or ID of the project. You can configure the default project using `az devops configure -d project=<NAME_OR_ID>`. **Required** if not configured as default or picked up via git config.|
|`query-examples`|Recommended JMESPath string. You can copy one of the queries and paste it after the `--query` parameter in double quotation marks to see the results. You can add one or more positional keywords so suggestions are based on these keywords.|
|`repository-id`|ID of the repository to filter results by exact match. For example, `--repository-ID e556f204-53c9-4153-9cd9-ef41a11e3345`.|
|`subscription`|Name or ID of subscription. You can configure the default subscription using `az account set -s <NAME_OR_ID>`.|

**Example**

The following command returns all the branch policies in effect in the `main` branch of the Fabrikam repository, ID `d28cd374-e7f0-4b1f-ad60-f349f155d47c`. You can get the repository ID by running `az repos list`.

This example uses the following default configuration: `az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamprime project="Fabrikam Fiber"`.

```azurecli
az repos policy list --repository-id d28cd374-e7f0-4b1f-ad60-f349f155d47c --branch main --output table

ID    Name                         Is Blocking    Is Enabled    Repository Id                         Branch

## Require a minimum number of reviewers

Code reviews are important for software development projects. To ensure that teams review and approve PRs, you can require approval from a minimum number of reviewers. The basic policy requires that a specified number of reviewers approve the code, with no rejections.

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

To set the policy, under **Branch Policies**, set **Require a minimum number of reviewers** to **On**. Enter the required number of reviewers, and select any of the following options:

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

:::image type="content" source="media/branch-policies/require-minimum-reviewers-2020.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Enable the Require Code Reviews policy.":::

- Select **Allow requestors to approve their own changes** to allow a PR's creator to vote on its approval. Otherwise, the creator can still vote **Approve** on the PR, but their vote won't count toward the minimum number of reviewers.

- Select **Prohibit the most recent pusher from approving their own changes** to enforce segregation of duties. By default, anyone with push permission on the source branch can both add commits and vote on PR approval. Selecting this option means the most recent pusher's vote doesn't count, even if they can ordinarily approve their own changes.

- Select **Allow completion even if some reviewers vote to wait or reject** to allow PR completion even if some reviewers vote against approval. The minimum number of reviewers must still approve.

- Under **When new changes are pushed**:

  - Select **Require at least one approval on the last iteration** to require at least one approval vote for the last source branch change.
  - Select **Reset all approval votes (does not reset votes to reject or wait)** to remove all approval votes, but keep votes to reject or wait, whenever the source branch changes, 
  - Select **Reset all code reviewer votes** to remove all reviewer votes whenever the source branch changes, including votes to approve, reject, or wait.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2020"

![Check the Require Code Reviews box](media/branch-policies/require-minimum-number-of-pr-reviews-2018.png)  

- If **Requestors can approve their own changes** isn't selected, the creator of the pull request can still vote **Approve** on their pull request, but their vote won't count toward the **Minimum number of reviewers**.
- If any reviewer rejects the changes, the pull request can't complete unless you select **Allow completion even if some reviewers vote to wait or reject**.
- You can reset code reviewer votes when new changes are pushed to the source branch. Select **Reset code reviewer votes when there are new changes**.

::: moniker-end

If all other policies pass, the creator can complete the PR when the required number of reviewers approve it.

# [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops" 

You can manage pull request required approver counts with [az repos policy approver-count](/cli/azure/repos/policy/approver-count).

### Create approver count policy

To create an approver count policy, use [az repos policy approver-count create](/cli/azure/repos/policy/approver-count#az-repos-policy-approver-count-create).

```azurecli
az repos policy approver-count create --allow-downvotes {false, true}
                                      --blocking {false, true}
                                      --branch
                                      --creator-vote-counts {false, true}
                                      --enabled {false, true}
                                      --minimum-approver-count
                                      --repository-id
                                      --reset-on-source-push {false, true}
                                      [--branch-match-type {exact, prefix}]
                                      [--detect {false, true}]
                                      [--org]
                                      [--project]
                                      [--subscription]
```

**Parameters**

|Parameter|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`allow-downvotes`|Allow downvotes. Accepted values: `false`, `true`. **Required**.|
|`blocking`|Block if the policy isn't met. Accepted values: `false`, `true`. **Required**.|
|`branch`|Branch name to filter results by exact match. The `--repository-id` parameter is required to use the branch filter. For example: `--branch main`. **Required**.|
|`creator-vote-counts`|Count the creator's vote. Accepted values: `false`, `true`. **Required**.|
|`enabled`|Enable the policy. Accepted values: `false`, `true`. **Required**.|
|`minimum-approver-count`|Minimum number of approvers required. For example: `2`. **Required**.|
|`repository-id`|ID of the repository to filter results by exact match. For example, `--repository-ID e556f204-53c9-4153-9cd9-ef41a11e3345`. **Required**.|
|`reset-on-source-push`|Reset votes when changes are pushed to the source. Accepted values: `false`, `true`. **Required**.|
|`branch-match-type`|Use the `branch` argument to apply the policy. If the value is `exact`, the policy applies on a branch that exactly matches the `--branch` argument. If the value is `prefix`, the policy applies across all branch folders that match the prefix in the `--branch` argument. Accepted values: `exact`, `prefix`. Default value: `exact`.|
|`detect`|Automatically detect organization. Accepted values: `false`, `true`.|
|`org`|Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization by using `az devops configure -d organization=<ORG_URL>`. **Required** if not configured as default or picked up via git config. Example: `https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.|
|`project`, `p`|Name or ID of the project. You can configure the default project using `az devops configure -d project=<NAME_OR_ID>`. **Required** if not configured as default or picked up via git config.|
|`subscription`|Name or ID of subscription. You can configure the default subscription using `az account set -s <NAME_OR_ID>`.|

**Example**

The following example sets the minimum number of required approvals to `2` for pull requests in the `main` branch of the Fabrikam repository. The policy allows downvotes, meaning that pull requests can complete even if some reviewers vote not to approve, as long as the minimum number vote to approve. Pushes to the source branch don't reset votes. The policy also allows pull request creators to approve their own pull requests.

This example uses the default configuration `az devops configure --defaults organization=https://dev.azure.com/fabrikamprime project="Fabrikam Fiber"`.

```azurecli

az repos policy approver-count create --allow-downvotes true --blocking true --branch main --creator-vote-counts true --enabled true --minimum-approver-count 2 --repository-id d28cd374-e7f0-4b1f-ad60-f349f155d47c --reset-on-source-push false --output table

ID    Name                         Is Blocking    Is Enabled    Repository Id                         Branch
----  ---------------------------  -------------  ------------  ------------------------------------  ---------------
27    Minimum number of reviewers  True           True          d28cd374-e7f0-4b1f-ad60-f349f155d47c  refs/heads/main
```

## Check for linked work items

For [work item management tracking](../../boards/backlogs/connect-work-items-to-git-dev-ops.md), you can require associations between PRs and work items. Linking work items provides more context for changes, and ensures that updates go through your work item tracking process.

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

To set the policy, under **Branch Policies**, set **Check for linked work items** to **On**. This setting requires that work items be linked to a PR for the PR to merge. Make the setting **Optional** to warn when there are no linked work items, but allow completion of the pull request.

## Build validation

You can set a policy requiring PR changes to build successfully before the PR can complete.
Build policies reduce breaks and keep your test results passing. Build policies help even if you're using [continuous integration](/devops/develop/what-is-continuous-integration) (CI) on your development branches to catch problems early.

A build validation policy queues a new build when a new PR is created or changes are pushed to an existing PR that targets the branch. The build policy evaluates the build results to determine whether the PR can be completed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before specifying a build validation policy, you must have a build pipeline. If you don't have a pipeline, see [Create a build pipeline](../../pipelines/create-first-pipeline.md). Choose the type of build that matches your project type.

   - Select the **Build pipeline**.

   - Optionally set a **Path filter**. [Learn more about path filters](#path-filters) in branch policies.

   - Under **Trigger**, select **Automatic (whenever the source branch is updated)** or **Manual**.

   - Under **Policy requirement**, select **Required** or **Optional**. If you choose **Required**, builds must complete successfully to complete PRs. Choose **Optional** to provide a notification of the build failure but still allow PRs to complete.

   - Set a build expiration to make sure updates to your protected branch don't break changes for open PRs.

     - **Immediately when \<branch name> is updated**: This option sets PR build policy status to *failed* whenever the branch is updated, and requeues a build. This setting ensures that the PR changes build successfully even if the protected branch changes.

       This option is best for teams whose important branches have few changes. Teams working in busy development branches may find it disruptive to wait for a build every time the branch updates.

     - **After \<n> hours if \<branch name> has been updated**: This option expires the current policy status when the protected branch updates if the passing build is older than the threshold you enter. This option is a compromise between always or never requiring a build when the protected branch updates. This choice reduces the number of builds when your protected branch has frequent updates.

     - **Never**: Updates to the protected branch don't change the policy status. This value reduces the number of builds, but can cause problems when completing PRs that haven't updated recently.

   - Enter an optional **Display name** for this build policy. This name identifies the policy on the **Branch policies** page. If you don't specify a display name, the policy uses the build pipeline name.

1. Select **Save**.

When the PR owner pushes changes that build successfully, the policy status updates.

If you have an **Immediately when \<branch name> is updated** or **After \<n> hours if \<branch name> has been updated** build policy, the policy status updates when the protected branch updates, if the previous build is no longer valid.

Set a policy requiring changes in a pull request to build successfully with the protected branch before the pull request can be completed.
Build policies reduce breaks and keep your test results passing. Build policies help even if you're using [continuous integration](/devops/develop/what-is-continuous-integration) (CI) on your development branches to catch problems early.

If a build validation policy is enabled, a new build is queued when either a new pull request is created, or if changes are pushed to an existing pull request targeting the branch. The build policy then evaluates the results of the build to determine whether the pull request can be completed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before specifying a build validation policy, you must have a build definition. If you don't have one, see [Create a build definition](/previous-versions/azure/devops/pipelines/apps/) and choose the type of build that matches your project type.

If you select **Required**, then the pull request can't be completed until:

- Every user added as a reviewer for the path approves the changes.
- At least one person in every group added to the path approves the changes.
- The number of reviewers specified for every group added to the path approves the changes.

## Bypass branch policies

In some cases, you might need to bypass policy requirements. Bypass permissions let you push changes to a branch directly, or complete pull requests that don't satisfy branch policies. You can grant bypass permissions to a user or group. You can scope bypass permissions to an entire project, a repo, or a single branch.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
Two permissions allow users to bypass branch policy in different ways:

- **Bypass policies when completing pull requests** applies only to pull request completion. Users with this permission can complete pull requests even if the pull requests don't satisfy policies.

- **Bypass policies when pushing** applies to pushes from local repositories and edits made on the web. Users with this permission can push changes directly to protected branches without meeting policy requirements.

![Screenshot showing bypass policy enforcement permissions.](media/branch-policies/policy-exempt-permission.png)

For more information about managing these permissions, see [Git permissions](../../organizations/security/permissions.md#git-repository-permissions-object-level).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops-2019"

In TFS 2015 through TFS 2018 Update 2, the **Exempt from policy enforcement** permission allows users with this permission to perform the following actions:

- When completing a pull request, opt-in to override policies and complete a pull request even if the current set of branch policies is not satisfied.
- Push directly to a branch even if that branch has branch policies set. Note that when a user with this permission makes a push that would override branch policy, the push automatically bypasses branch policy with no opt-in step or warning.

> Use caution when granting the ability to bypass policies, especially at the repo and project levels. Policies are a cornerstone of secure and compliant source code management.

## Path filters

Several branch policies offer path filters. If a path filter is set, the policy applies only to files that match the path filter. Leaving this field blank means that the policy applies to all files in the branch.

You can specify absolute paths (path must start either by `/` or a wildcard) and wildcards.
Examples:
- `/WebApp/Models/Data.cs`
- `/WebApp/*`
- `*/Models/Data.cs`
- `*.cs`

You can specify multiple paths using `;` as a separator.
Example:
- `/WebApp/Models/Data.cs;/ClientApp/Models/Data.cs`

Paths prefixed with `!` are excluded if they would otherwise be included.
Example:
- `/WebApp/*;!/WebApp/Tests/*` includes all files in `/WebApp` except files in `/WebApp/Tests`
- `!/WebApp/Tests/*` specifies no files, since nothing is included first

The order of filters is significant. Filters are applied left-to-right.

#### Can I push changes directly to branches that have branch policies?

You can't push changes directly to branches that have *required* branch policies unless you have permissions to [bypass branch policies](#bypass-branch-policies). Changes to these branches can be made only through [pull requests](pull-requests.md). You can push changes directly to branches that have *optional* branch policies, if they have no required branch policies.

#### What is autocomplete?

Pull requests into branches with branch policies configured have the **Set auto-complete** button. Select this option to [automatically complete](complete-pull-requests.md#complete-automatically) the pull request once it fulfills all policies. Autocomplete is useful when you don't expect any problems with your changes.

#### When are branch policy conditions checked?

Branch policies reevaluate on the server when pull request owners push changes and when reviewers vote. If a policy triggers a build, the build status sets to waiting until the build completes.

#### Can I use XAML build definitions in branch policies?

No, you can't use XAML build definitions in branch policies.

#### What wildcard characters can I use for required code reviewers?

Single asterisks `*` match any number of characters, including both forward-slashes `/` and back-slashes `\`. Question marks `?` match any single character.

Examples:

- `*.sql` matches all files with the *.sql* extension.
- `/ConsoleApplication/*` matches all files under the folder named *ConsoleApplication*.
- `/.gitattributes` matches the *.gitattributes* file in the root of the repo.
- `*/.gitignore` matches any *.gitignore* file in the repo.

#### Are the required code reviewer paths case-sensitive?

No, branch policies aren't case-sensitive.

#### How can I configure multiple users as required reviewers, but require only one of them to approve?

You can [add the users to a group](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md), and then add the group as a reviewer.  Any member of the group can then approve to meet the policy requirement.

#### I have bypass policy permissions. Why do I still see policy failures in the pull request status?

Configured policies are always evaluated for pull request changes. For users that have bypass policy permissions, the reported policy status is advisory only. If the user with bypass permissions approves, the failure status doesn't block pull request completion.

#### Why can't I complete my own pull requests when "Allow requestors to approve their own changes is set"?

Both the **Require a minimum number of reviewers** policy and the **Automatically included reviewers** policy have options to **Allow requestors to approve their own changes**. In each policy, the setting applies only to that policy. The setting doesn't affect the other policy.

For example, your pull request has the following policies set:

- **Require a minimum number of reviewers** requires at least one reviewer.
- **Automatically included reviewers** requires you or a team you're in as a reviewer.
- **Automatically included reviewers** has **Allow requestors to approve their own changes** enabled.
- **Require a minimum number of reviewers** doesn't have **Allow requestors to approve their own changes** enabled.

In this case, your approval satisfies **Automatically included reviewers**, but not **Require a minimum number of reviewers**, so you can't complete the pull request.

There might also be other policies, such as **Prohibit the most recent pusher from approving their own changes**, that prevent you from approving your own changes even if **Allow requestors to approve their own changes** is set.

#### What happens when path in path filters start neither with `/` nor with wildcard?


The path in path filters that start neither with `/` nor with a wildcard will have no effect, and the path filter will evaluate as if that path wasn't specified. That's because such a path can't match the `/` the absolute file path starts with.
