# Clone an existing Git repo

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-vs-gt-eq-2019.md)]

You can create a local copy of a remote Git repo by cloning it into a local folder on your computer. Cloning a remote repo downloads all [commits](commits.md) on all [branches](./create-branch.md) of the repo, unless you use the `--single-branch` clone option. Cloning links each branch in your new local repo with the corresponding branch in the remote repo. That way, when you [push](pushing.md) to share your local branch changes with your team, the corresponding remote branch is updated. Similarly, when you [pull](pulling.md) to update your local branch with changes made by your team, updates from the corresponding remote branch are retrieved. The remote repo can be an **Azure Repos** Git repo, a **GitHub** repo, or other hosted Git repo.

This article provides procedures for the following tasks:

## Get the clone URL of an **Azure Repos** Git repo

Typically, you need to know the clone URL of the remote repo that you want to clone. The clone URL uniquely identifies the remote repo.

> [!NOTE]
> When you're signed into an Azure DevOps project, Visual Studio supports searching for and cloning project repos without needing to know the clone URL.

1. From your web browser, open the team project for your Azure DevOps organization, and then choose **Repos** > **Files** to open the **Files** view.

[!INCLUDE [project-urls](../../includes/project-urls.md)]

## Get the clone URL of a **GitHub** repo

Typically, you need to know the clone URL of the remote repo that you want to clone. The clone URL uniquely identifies the remote repo. 

> [!NOTE]
> When you're signed into **GitHub**, Visual Studio supports searching for and cloning GitHub repos without needing to know the clone URL.

1. Open a browser and navigate to your **GitHub** account, select the **Repositories** tab, and choose the repository to clone.

   :::image type="content" source="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/common/github-repo.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the repository page on the GitHub site." lightbox="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/common/github-repo-lrg.png":::

1. On the **GitHub** repository page, choose **Code** to launch the **Clone** popup. Copy the clone URL from the **Clone** popup.

   :::image type="content" source="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/common/github-clone-repo.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the Clone popup on the  page on the GitHub site." lightbox="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/common/github-clone-repo-lrg.png":::

## Clone an Azure Repos Git repo

By signing in as a member of an Azure DevOps project, you can clone private repos that are accessible to you, and public repos. Visual Studio supports search, clone, and sync operations on repos that are accessible through authentication.

> [!NOTE]
> You can clone a public **Azure Repos** Git repo without signing in as a member of its parent Azure DevOps project. To clone a public Git repo without signing in, see [Clone any Git repo](#clone-any-git-repo) and [Connect to a project in Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/organizations/public/clone-git-repo-public).

#### [Visual Studio 2022](#tab/visual-studio-2022)

Visual Studio 2022 provides a Git version control experience by using the **Git** menu, **Git Changes**, and through context menus in **Solution Explorer**. Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 also offers the **Team Explorer** Git user interface. For more information, see the **Visual Studio 2019 - Team Explorer** tab.

## Clone any Git repo

You can clone any Git repo that's accessible to you by using the clone URL of the repo.

#### [Visual Studio 2022](#tab/visual-studio-2022)

[!INCLUDE [Clone any Git repo](includes/clone-any-git-repo.md)]

#### [Visual Studio 2019 - Git menu](#tab/visual-studio-2019-git-menu)

[!INCLUDE [Clone any Git repo](includes/clone-any-git-repo.md)]

#### [Visual Studio 2019 - Team Explorer](#tab/visual-studio-2019-team-explorer)

1. In **Team Explorer**, select **Connect** to open the **Connect** page, and then choose **Clone** under **Local Git Repositories**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/team-explorer/connect-clone.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the Clone link in the  Connect view of Team Explorer in Visual Studio 2019." lightbox="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/team-explorer/connect-clone-lrg.png":::

1. Enter the clone URL of the remote Git repo that you want to clone, verify the local folder path where you want to create the local clone, and then choose **Clone**. To clone the remote Git repo _and_ any Git repos that are nested within it, leave **Recursively Clone Submodules** checked.

   :::image type="content" source="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/team-explorer/clone-remote-repo.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the Clone options in the 'Local Git Repositories' section of the 'Team Explorer' Connect view in Visual Studio 2019." lightbox="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/team-explorer/clone-remote-repo-lrg.png":::

After you've cloned a remote Git repo, Visual Studio detects the local clone and adds it to the list of **Local Repositories** in the **Git** menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/common/local-repositories.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Local Repositories' option from the Git menu in Visual Studio 2019." lightbox="media/clone/visual-studio-2019/common/local-repositories-lrg.png":::

#### [Git Command Line](#tab/git-command-line)

1. If you haven't already, [download and install Git](http://git-scm.com/download). Enable [Git Credential Manager](set-up-credential-managers.md) when prompted during the install, or [configure SSH authentication](use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate.md).

1. At the command prompt, run the Git clone command with the [clone URL](#clone_url) of the remote repo. This command will create a local clone repo under the current folder.

```console
git clone <clone URL>
```

The Git clone command also let's you specify a folder path after the clone URL to create the repo in a specific location. For example:

```console
git clone https://fiber-teams@dev.azure.com/fiber-teams/FiberTests/_git/FiberTests C:\Repos\FiberTests
```

The Git clone command also let's you clone just a single branch. This option is useful when only one branch of a large repo is of interest to you.

```console
git clone <clone URL> --branch <branch name> --single-branch
```

>[!NOTE]
> When you clone a remote repository, Git assigns the alias `origin` as shorthand for the URL of the remote repo you cloned. Git commands often use that alias.
