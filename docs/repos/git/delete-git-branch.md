# Delete a Git branch

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This article describes how to delete a Git branch by using two different methods: in Visual Studio and from the command line.

> [!NOTE] 
> Deleting a branch in your local repo doesn't remove the branch on the remote.

#### [Browser](#tab/Browser/)

1. View your repo's branches by selecting **Repos** > **Branches** while viewing your repo on the web.

2. Select the **More** options button at the end of the row of the branch you want to delete.

   :::image type="content" source="media/delete-git-branch/more-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to access the menu to delete a branch.":::

3. In the options menu, select **Delete branch**.

4. In the **Delete branch** dialog box, select **Delete**.


#### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)

**Visual Studio 2015 & 2017**

1. Open up Team Explorer and go to the **Branches** view.
2. Locate the branch you want to delete. Remember that you can't delete a branch you're currently working in.
3. Right-click the branch name and select **Delete**. Visual Studio will ask if you're sure you want to delete the branch if you have unpublished changes.

You can delete a remote branch using the same method. Locate the tree for the remote in Team Explorer's **Branches** view (such as `remotes/origin`), right-click, and select **Delete**.

#### [Command Line](#tab/command-line/)
Delete a local branch using the `git branch -d` command while checked out to a different branch.

```
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

Deleting a remote branch requires use of the `git push` command using the `--delete` option.

```
git push origin --delete <branch_name>
```
