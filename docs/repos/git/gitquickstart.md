# Get started with Git in Azure Repos

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-2013](../../includes/version-vs-gt-2013.md)] 

Get started with developing your code using Azure Repos and Git repositories. You can use Visual Studio or Git commands to clone a repository, define local branches, commit and push changes, and sync with others. If you need to create or import a repository, see [Create a new Git repo in your project](create-new-repo.md) or [Import a Git repository](import-git-repository.md).

>[!NOTE]
>This article describes how to use Visual Studio to manage Azure Repos Git repositories. Using similar procedures, you can use Visual Studio to manage GitHub repositories. To clone a GitHub repository, get the URL as described in [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

For an overview of the Git workflow, see [Azure Repos Git tutorial](gitworkflow.md).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [azure-repos-prerequisites](includes/azure-repos-prerequisites.md)]

To learn more about permissions and access, see [Default Git repository and branch permissions](../../organizations/security/default-git-permissions.md) and [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md).


<a name="clone"></a>

## Get your code

You can [clone](clone.md) a remote Git repository to create a local copy of it. Cloning creates both a copy of the source code for you to work with and version control information so Git can manage the source code.

If you prefer to create a local repository without cloning, see [Create a new Git repo](creatingrepo.md). After creating your local repository you can proceed to [commit](#commit), [share](#push), and [sync](#pull) your work.

#### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/visual-studio-2019)

Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 and later versions provides a Git version control experience while maintaining the **Team Explorer** Git user interface. You can exercise Git features from either interface interchangeably. Below, we provide a side-by-side comparison for cloning a repository.

> [!NOTE]
> One advantage of connecting to a project through **Team Explorer** is you gain access to the Work Items hub. For an overview of **Team Explorer** features, see [Navigate in Visual Studio Team Explorer](../../user-guide/work-team-explorer.md).

## Commit your work

Git [branches](./create-branch.md) isolate your changes from other work in the project.
The recommended [Git workflow](gitworkflow.md) is to use a new branch for every feature or fix you work on.
You make [commits](commits.md) in your local Git repository to save your changes on that branch.

	![Click the Clone button](media/get-started/VSClone2.png)  


#### [Git Command Line](#tab/command-line)

1. Create a branch where you make your changes to the code. If you're collaborating with someone using a branch they've created, you can skip to the following `git checkout` step.

	> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
	```Git CLI
	> git branch ReadMeFix
    ```

   Choose a descriptive branch name for your work to remind you and others what kind of work is in the branch.

1. Check out your branch so you can start working in it.

	> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
	```Git CLI
	> git checkout ReadMeFix
    ```

   You can also use the `checkout` command to start working on a branch that other team members are already working in.

1. Make changes using your favorite tools on the code.

1. When you're satisfied with the changes, even if you aren't ready to share the work, save them in Git using a commit. Your changes won't be shared until you push them, as described in the following section.

	> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
	```Git CLI
	> git commit -a -m "Descriptive message"
    ```

   This command saves your changes locally to a new [commit](commits.md) in Git. Make sure to give the commit a short message that describes your changes after `-m`.

* * *
<a name="push"></a>

## Share your changes

After you've added one or more commits to a branch and you're ready to share those changes with others, [push](pushing.md) your commits so others can see them.

Once you've pushed your commits, you can create a [pull request](pull-requests.md). A pull request lets others know you'd like to have your changes reviewed. After approval, a pull request typically adds your changes to the default branch of the remote repository.

## Sync with others

You can keep your local branches in sync with their remote counterparts by [pulling](pulling.md) commits created by others. Although Git is good at merging incoming changes with your changes, sometimes you might have to [resolve a merge conflict](merging.md). While you're working on your feature branch, it's a good idea to periodically switch to your `main` branch and pull new commits to keep it current with the remote `main` branch.


#### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/visual-studio-2019)

:::row:::
  :::column span="":::

    **Visual Studio Git** <br><br>

    In the **Git Changes** window, you can keep your local branch current with its remote counterpart by using the **Fetch**, **Pull**, **Push**, and **Sync** buttons.

    :::image type="content" source="media/gitquickstart/visual-studio-2019/git-experience/sync-git-changes-window.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the Fetch, Pull, Push and Sync buttons in the 'Git Changes' window of Visual Studio 2019." lightbox="media/gitquickstart/visual-studio-2019/git-experience/sync-git-changes-window-lrg.png":::

    From left to right in the previous screenshot, the button controls are:

    - **Fetch** downloads remote commits that aren't in your local branch, but doesn't merge them.
    - **Pull** performs a fetch and then merges the downloaded commits into your local branch.
    - **Push** uploads your unpushed commits to the remote repository, which adds them to the corresponding remote branch.
    - **Sync** performs a **Pull** then a **Push**.

    You can also select **Fetch**, **Pull**, **Push**, and **Sync** from the Git menu.

    2. You can download the latest changes to your branch using the **Pull** link. There are two **Pull** links, one near the top and one in the **Incoming Commits** section. You can use either because they both do the same thing.

       :::image type="content" source="media/gitquickstart/visual-studio-2019/team-explorer/incoming-commits.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the Pull link in the Synchronization view of Team Explorer in Visual Studio 2019." lightbox="media/gitquickstart/visual-studio-2019/team-explorer/incoming-commits-lrg.png":::

1. Switch to the branch where you want to download the changes others have made. 

	> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
	```Git CLI
	> git checkout ReadMeFix
    ```

    In this example, you pull changes made by others on your team to the `ReadMeFix` branch to your local copy of the branch.

1. Pull the changes made by others to your local branch.

	> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
	```Git CLI
	> git pull
    ```

   Git downloads the changes and merges them with your own changes into your local branch.
