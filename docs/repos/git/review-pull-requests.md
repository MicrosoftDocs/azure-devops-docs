# Review pull requests

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

When you create a [pull request](pull-requests.md) (PR) and specify required/optional reviewers, Azure Repos will notify the reviewers that your PR is ready for review. All required reviewers must approve the changes in your PR before the changes can merge into the target branch. For PRs that change critical branches like the `main` branch, your team might have created [branch policies](branch-policies.md) that specify the reviewers or require a minimum number of reviewers. If branch policies add optional reviewers to your PR, you can keep them, require them, or remove them. If branch policies add required reviewers to your PR, you can't make them optional or remove them. For information about assigning reviewers through branch policies, see [Automatically include code reviewers](branch-policies.md#include-code-reviewers).

If you're reviewing a PR, try to give constructive feedback that's precise and easy to understand. For more information on review feedback, see [Pull request feedback](about-pull-requests.md#quality-feedback-for-pull-requests). This article describes how to review pull requests in Azure DevOps.

You can only review Azure DevOps PRs in the web portal by using your browser.

## Review changes

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2022"

Pull requests let designated reviewers examine, discuss, and vote on proposed changes before those changes are applied to a target branch of a repo. The following steps describe how reviewers of PRs in Azure Repos can navigate through a PR to understand the proposed changes.

1. From your web browser, open the team project for your Azure DevOps organization. Choose **Repo > Pull requests** to list the PRs. A newly opened PR defaults to the **Overview** tab.

1. The **Overview** tab of a PR shows the title, description, reviewers, linked worked items, history, status, and comments. Read the PR description to see the proposed changes. View the comments to understand the issues raised by other reviewers.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/overview-tab.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Repos PR overview tab.":::

1. Select the **Files** tab to review all content changes in the PR's source branch. The initial view shows a summary view of all file changes. Choose the **View** button next to a file to view only that file's changes. If the file was modified, the **View** button opens a diff view. If the file was added or deleted, the **View** button opens a content pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of a change summary view in the Files tab of a P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-lrg.png":::

    >[!NOTE]
    >For performance reasons, the summary view won't show changes for a file that's larger than 0.5 MB.

1. In a diff view for a file, you can select either a **Side-by-side** or **Inline** diff layout.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-diff-view.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of a side-by-side diff view in the Files tab of a P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-diff-view-lrg.png":::

    >[!TIP]
    >For any *single* file that's larger than 5 MB, the diff view shows truncated file content. For a diff view of the full content, download and review such files using a local diff tool.

    Use the left-hand file tree to view another file, or select the root of the file tree to see a summary view of all file changes.

1. To review the changeset introduced by specific [pushes](pushing.md) to the source branch, select one or more changesets from the changes dropdown list. When you select one or more changesets, the diff view updates to show only the changes from the selected changesets. This feature is useful when changes have been pushed to the PR since your last review and you just want to see the new changes. The changes dropdown list names each changeset with the commit message from the final commit in each push operation.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-changes-dropdown.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the changeset section dropdown in the Files tab of a P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-changes-dropdown-lrg.png":::

    >[!TIP]
    >Hold the **Shift** key when selecting multiple changesets from the changes dropdown list.

1. Choose the **Updates** tab to view all pushed changesets to ensure you haven't missed any source branch changes. The changesets are numbered and the most recent changeset appears at the top of the list. Each changeset shows the commits that were pushed in that push operation. A force-pushed changeset won't overwrite the changeset history and will show up in the changeset list same as any other changeset.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/updates-tab.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of a changeset list in the Updates tab of a P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/updates-tab-lrg.png":::

1. Choose the **Commits** tab to view the commit history of the source branch after it diverged from the target branch. The commit history in the **Commits** tab will be overwritten if the PR author force-pushes a different commit history, so the commits shown in the **Commits** tab might differ from the commits shown in the **Updates** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/commits-tab.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of a commit list in the Commits tab of a P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/commits-tab-lrg.png":::

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

To give a quick picture of PR status, the PR **Overview** tab summarizes checks, requirements, and branch policies that the PR is passing or failing. In some cases, the summary shows a snippet of the failure message from a status check's log. The overview lists only failed policies, but you can see all the passed and failed policy checks by selecting **View \<n> checks**.

On the PR **Overview** tab, you can review the PR description and comments to understand proposed changes and see issues other reviewers raised.

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2020/pull-request-overview-2020.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the PR overview tab.":::

::: moniker-end

### Review files
 

Select the PR **Files** tab to view the actual changes made to the source branch next to the target branch of the pull request.

> [!NOTE]
> The different changes between Azure DevOps Pull request and Azure DevOps Branch compare is caused by the different comparison methods.

There are two comparison methods for the git diff command. Two-dot (```git diff A..B```) and three-dot (```git diff A...B```). By default, pull requests show a three-dot diff while the Branch Comparison instead shows a two-dot diff.

For example:
```
      C---D---E branch
     /
A---B---F---G   master
```

```git diff branch..master``` will retrieve C, D, E, F, G commits. While ```git diff branch...master``` will produce only F, G.

Here are the relevant documentations about the git diff commands: [three-dot-and-two-dot-git-diff-comparisons](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests#three-dot-and-two-dot-git-diff-comparisons) & [git diff](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff)

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2020/pull-request-files.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a file diff view in the Files tab of an Azure Repos PR.":::

> [!NOTE]
> When viewing the difference for a *single selected file*, there's a file size limit of 5 MB. To view and diff files larger than 5 MB, you can download the file and view it using a local diff tool. When viewing the difference for a *collection of files*, the size limit for each file is 0.5 MB, for performance reasons.

### Review updates

Review previous versions of the code from the **All updates** drop-down list.

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2020/pull-request-file-updates.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing PR updates in the Files tab of an Azure Repos PR.":::

Every update to the branch adds a new version to the list and on the **Updates** tab of the PR. As you select different updates, the diff view updates to show the differences between the files in each version of the PR.

You can catch up with PR updates after being away from the PR by stepping through changes made since your last review.

Browse a list of changes from the author on the **Updates** tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2020/pull-request-updates.png" alt-text="Browse a list of changes from the author.":::

View and select changes made in commits to the branch on the **Commits** tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2020/pull-request-commits.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a list of commits in the Commits tab of an Azure Repos PR.":::



## Use comments

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2022"

PR authors and reviewers can communicate with each other by adding and responding to PR comments. When you review a PR, use comments to point out issues with the proposed changes, [suggest changes](#suggest-changes-in-comments), and respond to previous comments. Aim for constructive feedback that's precise and easy to understand. Address recipients directly by using their `@username`. Reference work items by using `#workitemID` and other PRs by using `!pullrequestID`. Sometimes, PR authors create comments for themselves for documentation purposes.

### Provide feedback in comments

If your feedback applies to a specific line or range of lines in a file, add a comment at that location within the file:

1. In the **Files** tab of a PR, hover over the line you want to comment on and select the comment button :::image type="icon" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/new-comment-icon.png"::: to open an inline comment box. You can also select multiple lines and then select the comment button that appears when you hover over those lines.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-icon.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the comment icon in Azure Repos P Rs." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-icon-lrg.png":::

1. Enter your comment in the comment box and choose **Comment**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-box.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the comment box in the Files tab of an Azure Repos P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-box-lrg.png":::

If your feedback applies to the entire file, add a file-level comment by selecting **Add comment** from the file options menu:

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-file-comment.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the file tree context menu in the Files tab of an Azure Repos P R.":::

To provide general feedback unrelated to a specific file, add a comment in the **Overview** tab:

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/overview-tab-comment-box.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of a comment box in the Overview tab of an Azure Repos P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/overview-tab-comment-box-lrg.png":::

PR reviewers can also use comments to [suggest changes](#suggest-changes-in-comments) to specific file lines, as described in the next section.

### Suggest changes in comments

You can use comments to suggest replacement text for one or more lines in a file:

1. In the **Files** tab of a PR, hover over the line you want to comment on and select the comment button :::image type="icon" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/new-comment-icon.png"::: to open an inline comment box. You can also select multiple lines and then select the comment button that appears when you hover over those lines. If accepted, your suggested content will replace the line or lines that your comment was added to.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-icon.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the comment icon in Azure Repos P Rs." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-icon-lrg.png":::

1. Select the light bulb icon under the comment box to make your suggested changes in the comment box within a fenced code block, and then choose **Comment**. You won't see a light bulb icon if you add a comment to the original code (left-hand side) of a side-by-side diff view.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-box-suggestion.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to make a suggested change in the Files tab of an Azure Repos P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-box-suggestion-lrg.png":::

PR authors can accept your suggestion by:

1. Choosing **Apply changes** to stage the change in readiness for a commit.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-box-apply-changes.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to accept a suggested change in the Files tab of an Azure Repos P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-comment-box-apply-changes-lrg.png":::

1. Choosing **Commit all changes** to commit all staged changes. PR authors can unstage a suggestion by choosing **Undo change**.

### Like comments

PR authors and reviewers can *like* their own or someone else's comment by hovering over the comment and choosing the thumbs-up icon:

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-like-comment.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot showing the like button in a P R comment." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/files-tab-like-comment-lrg.png":::

### Reply to comments

PR authors should reply to comments to let the reviewers know how they're addressing feedback and suggestions:

1. To reply to a comment, type your response in the **Write a reply** field. Address recipients directly by using their `@username`. Reference work items by using `#workitemID` and other PRs by using `!pullrequestID`.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/comment-reply.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to reply to a P R comment.":::

1. After entering your response, select **Reply & resolve** if your response is final. Otherwise, select **Reply**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/comment-reply-resolve.png"alt-text="Screenshot showing how to reply and/or resolve a P R comment.":::

    If you select **Reply & resolve**, the comment status will change to **Resolved**. PR authors can also directly change a comment's status, as described in the next section.

### Change comment status

New comments initially have an **Active** status, which PR authors update during PR the review process to indicate how they addressed reviewer feedback and suggestions. PR authors can select a comment status from the status dropdown list:

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/comment-status-dropdown.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the comment status options in a P R comment.":::

- **Active**: the default status for new comments.

- **Pending**: the issue in this comment is under review and awaits something else.

- **Resolved**: the issue in this comment is addressed.

- **Won't fix**: the issue in this comment is noted but won't be fixed.

- **Closed**: the discussion in this comment is closed.

PR authors and reviewers can track PR progress by [filtering](#filter-comments) on comment status, as described in the next section.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

Add comments to a PR to make suggestions, reply to previous comments, and point out problems with the proposed changes.

### Filter comments

::: moniker range=">=  azure-devops-2022"
You can select which comments or updates show on the **Overview** tab by selecting a filter option from the comment filter dropdown list. For example, select the **What's new** filter option to see new comments and updates since you last opened the PR. Each filter option shows the number of items for its category.

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/overview-tab-filter-comments.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot showing the comment filter options in the Overview tab of a P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/overview-tab-filter-comments-lrg.png":::

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

You can select which comments and updates show on the **Overview** tab. Hiding some comments and updates gets them out of the way when reviewing code for the first time. You can also show only what's new since the last time you visited the PR.

To filter comments and updates, select the **Show everything (n)** button above the comment list, and select one of the filtering options. The view changes to show only the selected comments and updates. The button label changes to show the filtering criteria and the number of items shown.

## Vote on PR changes

#### [Browser](#tab/browser)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2022"

PR reviewers can vote on a PR by selecting a vote option from the vote dropdown list. The reviewer icon on the PR page will show an indication of their vote.

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2022/pr-vote-options.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the vote options in an Azure Repos P R." lightbox="media/review-pull-requests/2022/pr-vote-options-lrg.png":::

The voting options are:

- **Approve**: approves the proposed changes in the PR. This option is just a vote and doesn't approve the PR.

- **Approve with suggestions**: approves the proposed changes in the PR with optional suggestions for improvement. This option is just a vote and doesn't approve the PR.

- **Wait for author**: asks the author to review the reviewer comments. The PR author should let the reviewers know to re-review the code after the PR author has addressed the comments. If a required reviewer sets this vote option, the vote will block PR approval.

- **Reject**: indicates that the changes aren't acceptable. When you choose this option, add a comment explaining why. If a required reviewer sets this vote option, the vote will block PR approval.

- **Reset feedback**: clears your vote. The absence of a vote doesn't prevent a PR from being [completed](#complete-a-pr).

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

Use the button at upper right in the PR to vote on the PR changes. The default option is **Approve**, but you can select other options from the dropdown list:

:::image type="content" source="media/review-pull-requests/2020/pr-voting-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows P R voting options.":::

- **Approve**: Approve the proposed changes in the PR.
- **Approve with suggestions**: Approve the PR, but provide optional suggestions for improvement.
- **Wait for author**: Don't approve the changes, and ask the author to review your comments. The author should let you know to review the code again after they address your concerns.
- **Reject**: The changes aren't acceptable. Leave a comment in the PR to explain why.
- **Reset feedback**: Remove your vote.

::: moniker-end

#### [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

To vote on whether to approve a PR, use the [`az repos pr set-vote`](/cli/azure/repos/pr#az-repos-pr-set-vote) command.
