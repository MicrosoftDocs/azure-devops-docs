> Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 and later versions provide a new Git menu for managing the Git workflow with less context switching than Team Explorer. Procedures provided in this article under the Visual Studio tab provide information for using the Git experience as well as Team Explorer. To learn more, see [Side-by-side comparison of Git and Team Explorer](/visualstudio/version-control/git-team-explorer-feature-comparison).
