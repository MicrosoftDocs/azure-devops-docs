## Create a PAT

> [!NOTE]
> The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this article. These differences result from updates made to Azure DevOps or enabled preview features. We've enabled the [New account manager page](/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features) feature. The basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned.

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).
  
2. From your home page, open user settings :::image type="icon" source="../../../media/icons/user-settings-gear.png" border="false":::, and then select **Personal access tokens**.

   ![Select Personal Access Tokens](/azure/devops/repos/git/media/select-personal-access-tokens.jpg)

3. Select **+ New Token**.

   ![Select New Token to create](/azure/devops/repos/git/media/select-new-token.png)

4. Name your token, select the organization where you want to use the token, and then set your token to automatically expire after a set number of days.

   ![Enter basic token information](/azure/devops/repos/git/media/create-new-pat.png)

5. Select the [scopes](../../../integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth.md#scopes)
   for this token to authorize for *your specific tasks*.

   For example, to create a token to enable a [build and release agent](/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents) to authenticate to Azure DevOps Services, limit your token's scope to **Agent Pools (Read & manage)**. To read audit log events, and manage and delete streams, select **Read Audit Log**, and then select **Create**.

   ![Select scopes for your PAT](/azure/devops/repos/git/media/select-pat-scopes-preview.png)   

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may be restricted from creating full-scoped PATs. If so, your Azure DevOps Administrator in Azure AD has enabled a policy which limits you to a specific custom defined set of scopes. For more information, see [Manage PATs with policies/Restrict creation of full-scoped PATs](../../../organizations/accounts/manage-pats-with-policies-for-administrators.md#restrict-creation-of-full-scoped-pats).
   > For a custom defined PAT, the required scope for accessing the Component Governance API, `vso.governance`, isn't selectable in the UI.

6. When you're done, make sure to copy the token and store it in a secure location. For your security, it won't be shown again.

::: moniker-end

 Use your PAT anywhere your user credentials are required for authentication in Azure DevOps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For organizations backed by Azure Active Directory, you have 90 days to sign in with your new PAT, otherwise it's considered inactive. For more information, see [User sign-in frequency for Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime).

### Notifications

Users receive two notifications during the lifetime of a PAT - one upon creation and the other seven days before the expiration.

After you create a PAT, you receive a notification similar to the following example. This notification confirms that your PAT was added to your organization.

   :::image type="content" source="/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/media/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate/pat-creation.png" alt-text="PAT created notification":::

The following image shows an example of the seven-day notification before your PAT expires.

   :::image type="content" source="/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/media/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate/pat-expiration.png" alt-text="PAT near expiration notification":::

#### Unexpected notification

If you receive an unexpected PAT notification, an administrator or tool might have created a PAT on your behalf. See the following examples.

- When you connect to an Azure DevOps Git repo through git.exe. it creates a token with a display name like "git: `https://MyOrganization.visualstudio.com/` on MyMachine."
- When you or an administrator sets up an Azure App Service web app deployment, it creates a token with a display name like "Service Hooks: : Azure App Service: : Deploy web app."
- When you or an administrator sets up web load testing as part of a pipeline, it creates a token with a display name like "WebAppLoadTestCDIntToken".
- When a Microsoft Teams Integration Messaging Extension is set up, it creates a token with a display name like "Microsoft Teams Integration".

> [!WARNING]
> If you believe that a PAT exists in error, we suggest that you [revoke the PAT](../../../organizations/accounts/admin-revoke-user-pats.md). Then, change your password. As an Azure AD user, check with your administrator to see if your organization was used from an unknown source or location. See also the FAQ about [accidentally checking in a PAT to a public GitHub repository](../../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md#q-what-happens-if-i-accidentally-check-my-pat-into-a-public-repository-on-github).

## Use a PAT

Your PAT is your identity and represents you when you use it, just like a password. 

**Git**

Git interactions require a username, which can be anything except the empty string.
The PAT is used as the password. Also, you have to Base64-encode the username and PAT to use with HTTP basic authentication.

#### [Windows](#tab/Windows/)

In PowerShell, enter the following code.

```powershell
$MyPat = ':PatStringFromWebUI'
$UserName = ':UserNameToUseWithToken'
$B64Pat = [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("$UserName:$MyPat"))
git -c http.extraHeader="Authorization: Basic $B64Pat" clone https://dev.azure.com/yourOrgName/yourProjectName/_git/yourRepoName
```

To keep your token more secure, use credential managers so you don't have to enter your credentials every time. We recommend [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager). [Git for Windows](https://www.git-scm.com/download/win) is required.

#### [Linux/macOS](#tab/Linux/)

In Bash, enter the following code.

```bash
MY_PAT=yourPAT # replace "yourPAT" with ":PatStringFromWebUI"
B64_PAT=$(printf "%s"":$MY_PAT" | base64)
git -c http.extraHeader="Authorization: Basic ${B64_PAT}" clone https://dev.azure.com/yourOrgName/yourProjectName/_git/yourRepoName 
```

To keep your token more secure, use credential managers so you don't have to enter your credentials every time. We recommend [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager).

***

**Existing repos**

For existing repositories, if you already added the origin using the username, run the following command first.

``git remote remove origin``

Otherwise, run the following command.

``git remote add origin https://<PAT>@<company_machineName>.visualstudio.com:/<path-to-git-repo> path to git repo = <project name>/_git/<repo_name> git push -u origin --all``

### Use a PAT in your code

You can use a PAT in your code, however note the following warning.

[!INCLUDE [warning-api-scopes](../../../organizations/accounts/includes/warning-api-scopes.md)]

#### [Windows](#tab/Windows/)

If you wish to provide the PAT through an HTTP header, first convert it to a Base64 string. The following example shows how to convert to Base64 using C#.

```cs

Authorization: Basic BASE64_USERNAME_PAT_STRING
```

The resulting string can then be provided as an HTTP header in the following format.

The following sample uses the [HttpClient class](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) in C#.

```cs
public static async void GetBuilds()
{
    try
    {
        var personalaccesstoken = "PATFROMWEB";

        using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
        {
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(
                new System.Net.Http.Headers.MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));

            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic",
                Convert.ToBase64String(
                    System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(
                        string.Format("{0}:{1}", "", personalaccesstoken))));

            using (HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(
                        "https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/build/builds?api-version=5.0").Result)
            {
                response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
                string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> When you're using variables, add a `$` at the beginning of the string, like in the following example.
>
>```cs
>public static async void GetBuilds()
>{
>    try
>   {
>       var personalaccesstoken = "PATFROMWEB";

>
>            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic",
>                Convert.ToBase64String(
>                    System.Text.ASCIIEncoding.ASCII.GetBytes(
>                        string.Format("{0}:{1}", "", personalaccesstoken))));
>
>           using (HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(
>                        $"https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/build/builds?api-version=5.0").Result)
>            {
>                response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
>                string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
>                Console.WriteLine(responseBody);
>            }
>        }
>    }
>    catch (Exception ex)
>    {
>        Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
>    }
>}
>```


#### [Linux/macOS](#tab/Linux/)

The following sample gets a list of builds using curl.

```curl

curl -u :{PAT} https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/build-release/builds
```

When your code is working, it's a good time to switch from basic auth to [OAuth](../../../integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth.md).

For more information and examples of how to use PATs, see the following articles:

- [Git credential managers](../set-up-credential-managers.md)
- [REST APIs](/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-5.1&preserve-view=true#assemble-the-request)
- [NuGet on a Mac](../../../artifacts/nuget/consume.md#mac-os)
- [Reporting clients](../../../report/powerbi/client-authentication-options.md#enter-credentials-within-a-client)
- [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../../cli/index.md).
