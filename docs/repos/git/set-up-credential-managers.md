#  Use Git Credential Managers to Authenticate to Azure Repos
#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015

Git Credential Managers simplify authentication with your Azure DevOps Services/TFS Git repos. Credential Managers let you use the same credentials that you use for the Azure DevOps Services/TFS web portal and support multi-factor authentication through Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). In addition to supporting multi-factor authentication with Azure DevOps Services, the credential managers also provide support two-factor authentication with [GitHub repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

Azure DevOps Services provides IDE support for MSA and Azure AD authentication through [Team Explorer in Visual Studio](../../organizations/projects/connect-to-projects.md), [IntelliJ and Android Studio with the Azure Repos Plugin for IntelliJ](/azure/devops/java/download-intellij-plug-in), and [Eclipse (with the Team Explorer Everywhere plug-in)](https://github.com/Microsoft/team-explorer-everywhere). If your environment doesn't have an integration available, configure your IDE  with a [Personal Access Token](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) or [SSH](use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate.md) to connect with your to your repos.

## Install the Git Credential Manager
 
### Windows 
Download and run the latest [Git for Windows installer](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which includes the Git Credential Manager for Windows. Make sure to leave the Git Credential Manager installation option enabled when prompted.

### macOS and Linux
We recomend [using SSH keys](use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate.md) to authenticate to Azure DevOps, not a credential manager.

> Review the [system and software requirements](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Mac-and-Linux/blob/master/Install.md#system-requirements) before installing the credential manager.
 
On macOS and Linux, there are [several install options](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Mac-and-Linux/blob/master/Install.md) that use native package managers to install the credential manager. After installing the package for your platform, run the following command to configure Git to use the credential manager :

&gt; git-credential-manager install</pre>

## Using the Git Credential Manager

When you connect to a Git repo in Azure Repos from your Git client for the first time, the credential manager  prompts for your Microsoft Account or Azure Active Directory credentials. If your account has multi-factor authentication enabled, you are prompted to go through that experience as well.

Once authenticated, the credential manager creates and caches a [personal access token](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md) for future connections to the repo. Git commands that connect to this account won't prompt for user credentials until the token expires or is revoked through Azure DevOps Services/TFS.

### Getting help 

You can open up and report issues with the Git Credential Manager for Windows on the [project GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/issues). 
Frequently Asked Questions for the Git Credential Manager for Windows are available in [the online readme](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/blob/master/Docs/Faq.md). 

Manual installation steps for the [Windows Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/blob/master/README.md#manual-installation) and the [macOS and Linux Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Mac-and-Linux/blob/master/Install.md#installing-on-mac-or-linux-without-a-package-manager) are available. Use these steps to install the credential manager if the recommended steps above are not suitable for your environment.

### Learn more

In addition to providing full source code, we've also documented how the credential manager integrates with Git. Refer to the MSDN blog posts on the [macOS and Linux Git Credential Manager](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/11/18/visual-studio-team-services-git-credential-manager-for-mac-and-linux.aspx) and the 
[Windows Credential Manager](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudioalm/archive/2015/12/08/announcing-the-git-credential-manager-for-windows-1-0.aspx). There is also
[an article on the project GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows/wiki/How-the-Git-Credential-Managers-works) with information on the low-level internals of the Git Credential Manager for Windows.
