[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-2015](../../includes/version-vs-gt-2015.md)]

Create pull requests (PRs) to change, review, and merge code in a [Git repository](creatingrepo.md). You can create PRs from branches in the upstream repository or from branches in your [fork](forks.md) of the repository. Your team can [review the PRs](review-pull-requests.md) and give feedback on changes. Reviewers can step through the proposed changes, leave comments, and vote to approve or reject the PRs. Depending on [branch policies](branch-policies.md) and other requirements, your PR might need to meet various criteria before you can [complete the PR](complete-pull-requests.md) and merge the changes into the target branch.

For PR guidelines and management considerations, see [About pull requests](about-pull-requests.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/note-cli-not-supported.md)]

## Add updates with cherry-pick

You can copy commits from one branch to another by using cherry-pick. Unlike a merge or rebase, cherry-pick only brings the changes from the commits you select, instead of all the changes in a branch.

To cherry-pick changes from a completed PR, select **Cherry-pick** on the PR's **Overview** page. To copy changes from an active PR, select **Cherry-pick** from the PR's **More options** menu. This action creates a new branch with the copied changes. You can then create a new PR from the new branch. For detailed instructions, see [Copy changes with cherry-pick](cherry-pick.md).

## Switch source and target branches of your pull request

Before the first time you save a PR, you can switch the source and target branches of the PR by selecting the **Switch source and target branches** icon next to the branch names. Once the PR is active, this icon goes away, but you can still [change the target branch](#change-the-target-branch-of-a-pull-request) of the PR.

![Screenshot of the switch source and target branches icon.](media/pull-requests/switch-branches.png)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

## Use pull request templates

A pull request template is a file containing Markdown text that populates the PR description when you create a PR. Good PR descriptions tell PR reviewers what to expect, and can help track tasks like adding unit tests and updating documentation. Your team can create a default PR template that adds text to all new PR descriptions in the repo. Also, you can select from branch-specific templates or other templates your team defines. For more information about creating and using PR templates, see [Improve pull request descriptions using templates](pull-request-templates.md).

If your repo has a default template, all PRs in the repo have the default template's description text at creation. To add other templates, select **Add a template** and then choose a template from the dropdown list. You can edit the template text in your description, remove it, or add other text.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

## Create draft PRs

If your PR isn't ready for review, you can create a draft PR to indicate work in progress. When the PR is ready for review, you can publish it, and begin or resume the full review process.

Draft PRs have the following differences from published PRs:

- Build validation policies don't run automatically. You can queue build validations manually by selecting the more options menu in the PR.
- Voting is disabled while in draft mode.
- Required reviewers aren't automatically added. Notifications are sent only to reviewers that you explicitly add to the draft PR.
- Draft PRs display in the PR list with a **Draft** badge.

> Creating draft PRs requires Azure DevOps Server 2019.1 update or later version.
::: moniker-end


# [Browser](#tab/browser)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

To create a draft PR, select the arrow next to **Create** and select **Create as draft** when creating the PR. You don't have to use title prefixes such as WIP or DO NOT MERGE.

![Screenshot showing Create as draft P R.](media/pull-requests/create-draft-pr.png)

When you're ready to have the PR reviewed and completed, select **Publish** at upper right in the PR. Publishing a PR assigns required reviewers, evaluates policies, and kicks off voting.

![Screenshot showing Publish for a P R.](media/pull-requests/publish-pr.png)

To change an existing published PR to a draft, choose **Mark as draft**. Marking a PR as draft removes all existing votes.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

To set a PR to draft, from the **Pull Requests** view in Team Explorer, right-click the PR and select **Open in browser**. On the PR's **Overview** page, select **Mark as draft**. 

# [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

To create a PR as a draft, set the `--draft` parameter to `true` when you create the PR. (Requires Azure DevOps Server 2020 or later version.)

For example:

```azurecli
az repos pr create --repository Fabrikam --source-branch new --draft true
```

To set an existing PR to draft, use `az repos pr update --id <PR Id> --draft true`.

To remove draft status from a PR, set `--draft` to `false`.

## Add or edit pull request title and description

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

On the **New pull request** page, enter a **Title** and detailed **Description** of your changes, so others can see what problems the changes solve. On a new PR as in existing PRs, you can see the **Files** and **Commits** in your PR on separate tabs. You can add reviewers, link work items, and add tags to the PR.

When you're ready to have your changes reviewed, select **Create** to create the PR.

Don't worry if you don't have all of the work items, reviewers, or details ready when you create your PR. You can add or update these items after you create the PR.

### Edit PR title and description

Keep the PR title and description up to date so reviewers can understand the changes in the PR.

You can update the title of an existing PR by selecting the current title and updating the text. Select the **Save** icon to save changes, or select the **Undo** icon to discard the changes.

Edit the PR description by selecting the **Edit** icon in the **Description** section.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

When you create a PR in Visual Studio, enter a title and detailed description of your changes so others can see what problems the changes solve. Keep these fields up to date so reviewers can understand the changes in the PR.

To edit the title, description, or any other details in an existing PR, open the PR in your browser. Right-click the PR from the **Pull Requests** view in Team Explorer, select **Open in browser**, and then make your updates on the PR's **Overview** page.


# [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
<a id="add-details-pr" /> 

You can add details during PR creation with [az repos pr create](/cli/azure/repos/pr#az-repos-pr-create), or update details in existing PRs with [az repos pr update](/cli/azure/repos/pr#az-repos-pr-update).

When you create a PR with `az repos pr create`, add a `--title` and a detailed `--description` of your changes so others can see what problems the changes solve. The `--description` parameter accepts Markdown entry, and each value in the argument is a new line of the PR description.

For example:

```azurecli
az repos pr create --repository Fabrikam --source-branch new --title "Update the readme" --description "This PR updates the readme." "These are *new* changes."
```

Keep these fields up to date so reviewers can understand the changes in the PR. To update details of a PR, use `az repos pr update` with the required PR `--id` parameter.

For example, to update the title and description for PR #21, use:

```azurecli
az repos pr update --id 21 --description "These updates are *no longer new*." --title "Old updates"
```

<a id="link-work-items-pr" /> 

You can link Azure Boards work items to PRs at PR creation with `az repos pr create --work-items <Id1> <Id2>`, where \<Id> is the work item's ID.

For example, the following command links work items #63 and #64 to a new PR in the `new` branch:

```azurecli
az repos pr create --repository Fabrikam --source-branch new --work-items 63 64
```

To manage work items for an existing PR, use [az repos pr work-item](/cli/azure/repos/pr/work-item).

- To link work items to an existing PR, use `az repos pr work-item add --id <PR Id> --work-items <Id1> <Id2>`.
- To list the work items linked to a PR, use `az repos pr work-item list --id <PR Id>`.
- To unlink a work item from a PR, use `az repos pr work-item remove --id <PR Id> --work-items <Id1>`.
  Unlinking only removes the link between the work item and the PR. Links created in the branch or from commits stay in the work item.

```azurecli
az repos pr work-item add --id
                          --work-items
                          [--detect {false, true}]
                          [--org]

<a name="add-tags"></a>

::: moniker range="> tfs-2018"

## Add tags to a pull request

Use tags to show important details and help organize PRs. Tags can communicate extra information to reviewers, such as that the PR is still a work in progress, or is a hotfix for an upcoming release. 

![Screenshot showing P Rs with tags.](media/pull-requests/pull-request-labels.png)

To add a tag when creating a PR, type a tag name in the **Tags** section. After you create the PR, you can manage tags in the **Tags** section.

## Add labels to a pull request

You can communicate extra information about a PR to the reviewers by using labels. Maybe the PR is still a work in progress, or it's a hotfix for an upcoming release. Use labels to communicate important details and help organize PRs.
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

> [!NOTE]
> Using PR labels requires TFS 2018.2 or later version.

<a name="change-the-target-branch-of-a-pull-request"></a>
::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2019"

## Change the target branch of an active pull request

For most teams, nearly all PRs target a default branch, such as `main` or `develop`. If you sometimes need to target a different branch, it's easy to forget to change the target branch when you create the PR. If that happens, you can change the target branch of an active PR:

1. Select **More actions** at upper-right on the PR **Overview** page, and then select **Change target branch** from the dropdown menu.
1. In the **Change target branch** pane, select **Choose a target branch**, select the new branch, and then select **Change**.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

## Email pull request notifications to stakeholders

You can share a pull request by email to notify reviewers and communicate with team members. To share a PR:

1. Select **More options** on the PR **Overview** page, and then select **Share pull request**.

   ![Screenshot that shows selecting Share pull request on a P R's Overview page.](media/pull-requests/share.png)

1. On the **Share pull request** screen, add recipients by typing their names in the **To:** field and selecting from the user names that appear. You can also remove recipients.

1. Add an optional message in the **Note (Optional)** field, and then select **Send**. Recipients receive an email requesting their attention and linking to the PR.

>[!NOTE]
>If you use the built-in email feature, you can only send the email to project members' individual addresses. Adding a team group or security group to the **To:** line isn't supported. If you add an email account that the system doesn't recognize, you receive a message that one or more recipients of your email don't have permissions to read the mailed pull request.

::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
For the email feature to work, your administrator for Azure DevOps Server must [configure an SMTP server](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts?view=azure-devops-2020&preserve-view=true).
