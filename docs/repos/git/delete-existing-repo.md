# Delete a Git repo from your project
#### Azure Repos | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015

Remove unused Git repos from your project when they are no longer needed. 

>[!TIP]
> Consider [renaming](repo-rename.md) the repo and [locking](lock-branches.md) its default branch instead of removing it. The [commit history](review-history.md) of the repo will be lost when it is deleted.


>[!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot remove a repo if it is the only Git repo in the Project. If you need to delete the only Git repo in a Project, [create a new Git repo](create-new-repo.md) first, then delete the repo.
>      
> You must have [Delete Repository permissions](../../organizations/security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md#git-repository) to delete a repo from a project. 


>[!NOTE]
>The steps in this article show how to delete a Git repo from your project. If you want to delete the entire project, see [Delete a project](../../organizations/projects/delete-project.md).
