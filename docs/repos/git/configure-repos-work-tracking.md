# Configure repositories and branches to integrate with work tracking  

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

To support traceability of your Git code with work tracking, you can exercise one or more features and configure several options.  
 

The following table summarizes the integration points between Azure Boards and Azure Repos, Git. Through various link types, you can track code changes&mdash;commits and pull requests for Git&mdash;that support development of user stories and features. The link types used to construct these links include *Branch , Commit, Pull Request*, and *Tag*.

## Configure Git repositories to support work tracking 

You can enable several options to automate linking of work items from commits or pull requests. 

To configure the repository, open **Project Settings>Repositories**, choose a repository, and then view the **Settings** tab. 

:::image type="content" source="media/work-tracking/repo-settings-work-tracking.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Project Settings>Repositories>Settings showing work tracking options."::: 

Enable the following options: 

- **Commit mention linking**
	When enabled, commit messages containing `#` followed by a valid work item ID will automatically link the commit to the mentioned work item. Disable this option when pushing a repository previously contained by a different account or service. If you [import a repository](import-git-repository.md), we automatically turn this option off.
- **Commit mention work item resolution**
	Enable this option to support closing work items mentioned in commits with the `Fixes` prefix, for example `Fixes #*WorkItemID*`. 
- **Work item transition preferences**
	When enabled, the default option, the system remembers each user's last choice to complete linked work items during pull request completion. Depending on your team's preference, you may choose to disable this option to discourage users from completing work items with their pull requests. When disabled, users must opt-in to completing work items for each pull request.

## Configure branch policies to support work tracking

To ensure that changes to a branch have links to work items, you configure the branch policy for a Git repository. 


To configure the branch, open **Project Settings>Repositories**, choose a Git  repository, and then view the **Policies** tab. Scroll down and choose a branch under the **Branch policies** section. Linking work items provides additional context for your changes and ensures that updates go through your work item tracking process.

Turn on the **Check for linked work items** option. 
- Choose **Required** to mandate all pull requests have at least one linked work item in order to be completed. 
- Choose **Optional** to allow pull requests to be completed without linked work items, but issue a warning that there are no linked work items.
