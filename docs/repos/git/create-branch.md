# Create a new Git branch

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-2015](../../includes/version-vs-gt-2015.md)]

The first commit in a new Git repo is the start of the `main` branch. As you work in the `main` branch, you make commits to record your work in that branch. Branching in Git occurs when you create a new line of development that diverges from a prior branch. You might choose to create a new branch to develop and test a new feature before adding it to your `main` branch. The recommended [Git workflow](gitworkflow.md) is to use a new branch for every feature or bugfix. When you switch between branches, Git almost instantly switches the version of your repo files to match the branch you selected. Your [commits](commits.md) are always saved to the current branch, and are isolated from commits in other branches.

For an overview of the Git workflow, see [Azure Repos Git tutorial](gitworkflow.md).


## Create a new branch

> [!NOTE]
> Branch names can't contain ASCII control characters, such as spaces, tildes, and colons. It's common practice to use lowercase characters and to separate words with a hyphen. Forward slashes can be used to group branches. Branch name length shouldn't exceed 250 ASCII characters. To avoid ambiguity between branch names and commit hashes, don't use branch names that consist of 40 hexadecimal characters. For more information on branch naming, see [git-check-ref-format](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-check-ref-format.html) and [Git cross-platform compatibility](os-compatibility.md).

#### [Browser](#tab/browser)

#### GitHub

From your web browser, navigate to the main page of your **GitHub** repo, select a base branch to launch the **Switch branches/tags** dialog, enter a unique new branch name, and then choose **Create branch**.

:::image type="content" source="media/create-branch/browser/github/create-branch.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'Switch branches/tags' dialog on the main page of a GitHub repo.":::

The main page of your repo now shows the files in your new branch.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2020 >= azure-devops-2019"

1. View your repo's branches by selecting **Repos** > **Branches** while viewing your repo on the web.

> `git fetch`<br>
> `git switch <remote branch name>`


#### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/visual-studio-2019)

Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8 and later versions provides a Git version control experience while maintaining the **Team Explorer** Git user interface. To use **Team Explorer**, uncheck **Tools** > **Options** > **Preview Features** > **New Git user experience** from the menu bar. You can use Git features from either interface interchangeably. Below, we provide a side-by-side comparison of how to create a branch.

:::row:::
  :::column span="":::

    **Visual Studio Git** <br><br>

    1. From the **Git** menu on the menu bar, choose **New Branch** to open the **Create a new branch** window.

      :::image type="content" source="media/create-branch/visual-studio-2019/git-experience/branches.png" border="true" alt-text="Screenshot of the 'New Branch' option in the Git menu in Visual Studio 2019." lightbox="media/create-branch/visual-studio-2019/git-experience/branches-lrg.png":::

    2. In the **Create a new branch** window, enter a descriptive branch name to let others know what work the branch contains. By default, Visual Studio creates your new branch from the current branch. The **Checkout branch** checkbox automatically switches you to the newly created branch. Select **Create**.

    **Visual Studio Team Explorer** <br><br>

    1. In **Team Explorer**, select the **Home** button and choose **Branches**.

    2. Right-click the default branch, often named `main`, and then choose **New Local Branch From**

    3. Enter a descriptive branch name to let others know what work the branch contains. Select **Create Branch**.

#### [Visual Studio 2017 & earlier](#tab/visual-studio)

**Visual Studio 2015 & 2017**

1. Open up Team Explorer and go to the **Branches** view.
1. Right-click the parent branch (usually `main`) to base your changes and choose **New Local Branch From...**. 
1. Supply a branch name in the required field and select **Create Branch**. Visual Studio automatically performs a `checkout` to the newly created branch.

#### [Git Command Line](#tab/git-command-line)

To create a new branch, use the `git branch` command. This command doesn't switch your current branch to the new branch.

```Git CLI
git branch <new branch name>
```

To switch to a branch, use the `git checkout` command.

```Git CLI
git checkout <existing branch name>
```

To create and switch to a branch in one command, use the `git checkout` command with the `-b` flag.

```Git CLI
git checkout -b <new branch name>
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also use `git switch <existing branch name>` to switch to a new branch. Or, to create and switch to a new branch in one command, use `git switch -c <new branch name>`.
