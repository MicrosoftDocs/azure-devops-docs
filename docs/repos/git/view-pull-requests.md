# View, filter, and open pull requests

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-2015](../../includes/version-vs-gt-2015.md)]

You create pull requests (PRs) to [review](review-pull-requests.md) and [merge](complete-pull-requests.md) code changes in a [Git repository on Azure Repos](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#add-a-repository-to-your-project). Team members and stakeholders can review changes and give feedback before merging the code into the target branch. Reviewers can also comment on changes and vote to approve or reject the code.

Teams can require PRs for any changes on protected branches, and set [branch policies](branch-policies.md) to require certain PRs to meet specific criteria. 

There are several ways to list, filter, view, and open PRs for a project.

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
- **Repos** must be enabled on your project. If the **Repos** hub and associated pages don't display, see [Turn an Azure DevOps service on or off](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md) to reenable Repos.
 
- To view PRs, you must be a member of the Azure DevOps project the PR is in, with **Basic** access or higher. If you aren't a project member, [get added](../../organizations/accounts/add-organization-users.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > For public projects, users granted **Stakeholder** access have full access to Azure Repos.

- To learn more about permissions and access, see [Default Git repository and branch permissions](../../organizations/security/default-git-permissions.md) and [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md).

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

- In Azure DevOps Services, you can manage PRs and other resources from the [Azure command-line interface (CLI)](/cli/azure/) with the `azure-devops` extension. To learn how to work with the Azure DevOps Services CLI, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md). Azure Repos CLI commands for PRs use [az repos pr](/cli/azure/repos/pr).

<a id="define-custom-pr-view" />

## Define a custom pull request view

Filtering the PR list helps you find and organize PRs to prioritize the most important files in your workflow.

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

To filter the PR list, on the **Pull requests** page, select the **Filter** icon at upper right. Then select **Target branch** or other column header, and select the branch or other value you want to filter on.

To further customize your view of the PR list, select **Customize view** at upper right on the **Pull requests** page.

![Screenshot showing the Customize view button on the Pull requests page.](media/view-pull-requests/customize-view.png)

On the **Customize view** page, you can rearrange the current view sections, edit them, or remove them. To create a new section, select **Add section**.

![Screenshot showing the Customize view page with the Add section button.](media/view-pull-requests/add-section.png)

On the **Customize section** page, enter and select values to filter the section by parameters like draft state or updated date. You can choose whether to **Show pull requests I've approved or rejected on a separate tab**, or **Exclude pull requests (duplicates) included in previous sections**. When you finish customizing the view, select **Save**.

![Screenshot showing the Customize section page.](media/view-pull-requests/customize-section.png)

These customized views create separate, collapsible sections on the pull request page. These custom queries also work across repositories on the **My pull requests** tab of the organization home page.
![Screenshot of the Pull Requests page showing collapsible sections.](media/view-pull-requests/views.png)

To change the parameters of the customized views, select the **Customize** button next to the view. Or select **Customize view**, and on the **Customize view** screen, select the view you want to change. Some views, like **Assigned to me**, can't be customized, but they can be rearranged or removed.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

On a PR **Files** tab, you can use several filters to select files and comments for faster reviews. Select **Filter**, and then select among the options.

![Screenshot of the Files tab with filter options.](./media/view-pull-requests/filter.png)

- Keyword: Enter a keyword.
- Reviewed/Unreviewed: **All** (default), **Pending**, **Reviewed**.
- Commented files: **All files** (default), **Files with comments**.
- Comments: **Show** (default), **What's new**, **Hide**.
- Comment status: **Active** (default), **Pending**, **Resolved**, **As designed**, **Won't fix**, **Closed**.
- Commented by: **All comments** (default), or a specific person.

You can also type a string into the Search field to show matching results from the preceding options.

::: moniker-end

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

From the Team Explorer **Pull Requests** view:
- Select **Active**, or **Assigned to me or my team**, to filter the PR lists by PR status or assignment.
- Or, type in the **Type here to filter the list** fields to filter the PR lists by date, author, branch, or other attributes.

# [Azure DevOps CLI](#tab/azure-devops-cli)

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can use several [az repos pr list](/cli/azure/repos/pr#az-repos-pr-list) parameters to filter the list of PRs, such as `--creator`, `--project`, `--repository`, `--reviewer`, `--source-branch`, `--status`, `--target-branch`, and `--top`.

The `--creator` and `--reviewer` values can be display names or email addresses. The `--top` parameter defines the maximum number of PRs to list.

For example, to list details about the last PR you created, regardless of its status, use:

```azurecli
az repos pr list --creator "My Name" --status all --top 1
```

::: moniker-end

<a id="open-pr" />

## Open a pull request

When you open a PR from the browser, from Visual Studio, or from Azure CLI, the PR **Overview** page opens in the browser. 

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

To open a PR in the browser, select the PR from the list on the **Pull requests** page. The PR opens to its **Overview** tab. The **Overview** tab shows the PR title, description, reviewers, linked worked items, history, and status. You can see a summary of branch policies that are passing or failing, and see comments reviewers have made.

:::image type="content" source="media/view-pull-requests/pull-request-overview-2020.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the P R Overview tab.":::

On the PR **Files** tab, you can review the actual changes in the PR files. On the **Updates** and **Commits** tabs, you can see changes the author has made to update the PR branch.

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

From the Team Explorer **Pull Requests** view, right-click the PR and select **Open in browser** to open the PR in the web portal.

### Check out a branch

Starting with Visual Studio 2017 Update 6, you can check out a PR's source branch directly from the **Pull Requests** view. Right-click a PR, and choose **Checkout Source Branch**.

![Screenshot that shows Checkout source branch.](./media/view-pull-requests/checkout-pr-source-branch.png)


[!INCLUDE [temp](includes/note-new-git-tool.md)]
