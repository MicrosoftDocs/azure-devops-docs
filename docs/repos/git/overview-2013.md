<p>You can begin using [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) distributed version control before you write your first line of code with virtually no cost or risk. You get many benefits, including being able to revert to a known good state whenever you get in trouble. When you need to switch contexts, you can quickly create a private local branch. Later, you can either publish the branch or dispose of it.</p>

<p>All this is done on your local dev machine, with no server required. When you're ready, you can quickly share your code and begin collaborating in TFS or on a third-party Git service.</p>

<p>You can use Visual Studio and Git to collaborate with your team using Azure DevOps Services or TFS, on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/), or on a third-party service such as GitHub or Bitbucket.</p>
