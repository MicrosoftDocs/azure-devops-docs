5. Select the [scopes](/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth#scopes)
   for this token to authorize for *your specific tasks*.

   For example, to create a token to enable a [build and release agent](/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents) to authenticate to Azure DevOps Services, 
   limit your token's scope to **Agent Pools (Read & manage)**, and then select **Create**.

## Use your personal access token

Your token is your identity and represents you when it's used. Keep your tokens secret and treat them like your password.


See the following examples of using your PAT.

- Username: yourPAT
- Password: yourPAT

or
 
- git clone https://anything:{yourPAT}@dev.azure.com/yourOrgName/yourProjectName/_git/yourRepoName

To keep your token more secure, use credential managers so you don't have to enter your credentials every time. We recommend the following credential managers:

* [Git Credential Manager for macOS and Linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Mac-and-Linux)
* [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows)
	(requires [Git for Windows](https://www.git-scm.com/download/win))

## Revoke personal access tokens to remove access

When you don't need your token anymore, just revoke it to remove access.

1. From your home page, open your profile. Go to your security details.

2. Revoke access.
