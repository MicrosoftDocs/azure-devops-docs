#  Git command reference 
#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 Update 2

## Overview

<a name="set_up"></a>
<a name="pat"></a>

Visual Studio's [Team Explorer](../../user-guide/work-team-explorer.md) lets you perform most common Git tasks you'll need for your day to day work right from Visual Studio. 
Open Team Explorer through the **View** menu in Visual Studio, or with the **Ctrl+\, Ctrl+M** hotkey.   

Team Explorer and the Git command line work great together. When you make updates and perform commands through one interface, you'll see those changes reflected in the other.

[Git Installation instructions](/azure/devops/learn/git/install-and-set-up-git) are available if you don't have Git installed on your computer.

> [!TIP]
> Windows users: If you aren't using Visual Studio, installing [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) will set up the [Git credential manager for Windows](set-up-credential-managers.md). The credential manager makes it easy to authenticate with Azure Repos.

While in Visual Studio, open a command prompt in your repo from Team Explorer's **Connect** view. Right-click on your local repo and select **Open Command Prompt**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some commands require having [specific Git permissions](../../organizations/security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md#git-repository) in Azure Repos to complete.
