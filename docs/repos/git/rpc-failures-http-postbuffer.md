# RPC failures and http.postBuffer

#### Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013

If you see an `RPC failed` error during `git push`, such as:

* `error: RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 404`
* `error: RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 411`
* `Unable to rewind rpc post data - try increasing http.postBuffer`
  `error: RPC failed; result=56, HTTP code = 0`

... and search for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2702731/git-fails-when-pushing-commit-to-github) or [MSDN forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/cdeb11b8-5c79-4563-bf7d-db969e2e951d/tfs-2013-visual-studio-online-git-push-size-limitation?forum=TFService), you'll see a lot of old recommendations to set `http.postBuffer`.

**Don't do it!** At least not blindly. First, review the suggestions in this article.

## Upgrade Git
If you're still running a Git client that's version 2.8 or older, you should upgrade Git first. There are a bug fixes in newer versions of Git that should obviate the need to set `http.postBuffer`.

We had enough support requests from internal users and external customers hitting bugs in older versions of Git that we decided to add a server-side reminder to Azure DevOps Services/TFS.

```
c:\mydir>git fetch
remote: Microsoft (R) Visual Studio (R) Team Services
remote: We noticed you're using an older version of Git. For a better experience, upgrade to the latest version at https://git-scm.com/downloads
remote: Found 4 objects to send. (6 ms)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
```

## Check hotfixes

Check if these hotfixes are applicable if your TFS server is running Windows 2012 R2 or earlier:

* [Pushing large files to Team Foundation Server by Git client hangs](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4017691/pushing-large-files-to-team-foundation-server-by-git-client-hangs)

## Check if you're using a proxy or load balancer
If you're using a terrible proxy that's buggy or doesnâ€™t support chunked encoding, you'll see errors for larger pushes. The same thing can happen if you put on-prem TFS behind a misconfigured load balancer. If the same push succeeds when bypassing the proxy, or bypassing the load balancer (e.g. by pushing to localhost from the server itself), then fix your proxy or load balancer instead!

### What if my proxy or load balancer is broken, but I don't have any control over it?
This is the only scenario that we've seen where setting `http.PostBuffer` is useful for newer versions of Git.

## http.postBuffer questions

### Is setting `http.postBuffer` harmful?

In our experience, it's more unnecessary than harmful, but there are a few negative side effects:

* Increasing it above the default may increase latency for larger pushes (since the client will buffer the HTTP request into larger chunks).
* If you set it larger than the HTTP chunk size limit for your HTTP server (e.g. `maxAllowedContentLength` and `maxRequestLength` in `web.config` for TFS servers), then all pushes larger than the chunk size limit will start failing.

### How do I unset `http.postBuffer` if I've already set it?

To check if it's set, run:

```
git config --show-origin --get-all http.postBuffer
```

You may have to unset it in both your global `.gitconfig` file:

```
git config --global --unset http.postBuffer
```

As well as in your repo level `.git/config` (which overrides the global setting):

```
git config --local --unset http.postBuffer
```
