# Set branch permissions

#### Azure Repos | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 Update 1

## Overview

Set up permissions to control who can read and update the code in a branch on your Git repo.
You can set permissions for individual users and groups, and inherit and override permissions as needed from your [repo permissions](../../organizations/security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md#git-repository).

## Use the branches view to configure security

1. Open the **Branches** page by navigating to your project in the web portal and selecting **Repos**, **Branches**.

  ![Open up the Branches page on the web](_img/branches/branches_nav-new-nav.png)

  If you're not using the new navigation preview, select **Code**, **Branches**.

  ![Open up the Branches page on the web](_img/branches/branches_nav.png)

1. Locate your branch in the page. You can browse the list or you can search for your branch using the **Search all branches** box in the upper right.

0. Open the context menu by selecting the **...** icon next to the branch name. Select **Branch security** from the menu.

## Add users or groups

> Avoid trouble:  You can only add permissions for users and groups already in your Project. [Add new users and groups to your Project](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md) before setting branch permissions. 

Add users or groups to your branch permissions by selecting **Add** 
Enter the sign-in address or group alias, then select **Save Changes**.

## Remove users or groups

Remove permissions for a user or group by selecting the user or Azure DevOps group, then selecting **Remove**. 
The user or group will still exist in your Project and this change will not affect other permissions for the user or group.

## Set permissions 

Control branch permission settings from the branch permission view. Users and groups with permissions set at the repo level will
[inherit those permissions](../../organizations/security/about-permissions.md#inheritance) by default. 

> [!NOTE] 
> These permissions have changed in TFS 2017 Update 1 and Azure DevOps Services.
> Ensure you are viewing the correct version of this documentation for permissions by choosing your product version

### Permissions in Azure DevOps Services

>[!NOTE]
>[In Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/release-notes/2018/jul-10-vsts#allow-bypassing-branch-policies-without-giving-up-push-protection), the **Exempt from policy enforcement** permission (which is still available in TFS 2015 through TFS 2018 Update 2) was removed and its functionality divided into the following two new permissions:
>
>- **Bypass policies when completing pull requests**
>- **Bypass policies when pushing**
>
>Users that previously had **Exempt from policy enforcement** enabled now have the two new permissions enabled instead. See the following table for more details on these two new permissions.

| Permission  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Contribute                                       | Users with this permission can push new commits to the branch and lock the branch.                          |
| Edit Policies                                    | Can edit [branch policies](branch-policies.md).                                                                                   |
| Bypass policies when completing pull requests    | Users with this permission are exempt from the [branch policy](branch-policies.md) set for the branch when completing pull requests and can opt-in to override the policies by checking **Override branch policies and enable merge** when completing a PR.                            |
| Bypass policies when pushing   | Users with this permission can push to a branch that has branch policies enabled. Note that when a user with this permission makes a push that would override branch policy, the push automatically bypasses branch policy with no opt-in step or warning.  |
| Force Push (Rewrite History and Delete Branches) | Can force push to a branch, which can rewrite history. This permission is also required to delete a branch. |
| Manage Permissions                               | Can set permissions for the branch.                                                                         |
| Remove Others' Locks                             | Can remove [locks](lock-branches.md) set on branches by other users.                                                            |
