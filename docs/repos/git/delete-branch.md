# Delete a Git branch from the web portal

**Azure Repos | Azure DevOps Server 2020 | Azure DevOps Server 2019 | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**

>[!IMPORTANT]
> This topic covers deleting a Git branch via the web in Azure DevOps Services and TFS. If you need to delete a Git branch in your own repo from Visual Studio or the command line,
> follow [these steps](./delete-git-branch.md) in the [Azure Repos Git tutorial](gitworkflow.md).

1. Open your repo on the web and [select the **Branches** view](manage-your-branches.md).

2. Locate your branch on the branches page. If you don't see it, select **All** to view all branches and filter the branches using the **Search all branches** box in the upper right.

3. Select the trashcan icon next to the branch you want to delete.
