#### Q: Why is my first Azure bill larger than expected?

A: Charges for your first purchase are prorated during the 
1st month and are combined with charges for the next month, 
which are billed on the 1st day of the calendar month.
This means your first Azure bill might include these 
partial charges **and** your 1st full month.
