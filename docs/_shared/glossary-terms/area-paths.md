## Area path
Area paths are used to group work items by team, product, or feature area. Iteration paths are used to group work into sprints, milestones, or other event-specific or time-related periods. You can use area paths to define a hierarchy of paths. To learn more, see [About area and iteration paths](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations).
