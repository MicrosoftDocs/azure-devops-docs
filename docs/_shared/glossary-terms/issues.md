## Issues or impediments
A type of work item that helps track unplanned activities. Resolving an issue or 
impediment requires more work beyond what was scheduled based on actual requirements. 
Using the issue (Agile or CMMI process) or impediment (Scrum process) work item type helps 
you track and manage these issues until you can resolve and close them.  Learn more:
