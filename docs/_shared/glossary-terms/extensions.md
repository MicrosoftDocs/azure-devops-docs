## Extensions

Extensions are simple add-ons that are used to customize and extend the DevOps experience of Azure DevOps Services and TFS. They are written with standard technologies&mdash;HTML, JavaScript, CSS&mdash;and can be developed using your preferred development tools. Hundreds of extensions are available from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), Azure DevOps tab.
