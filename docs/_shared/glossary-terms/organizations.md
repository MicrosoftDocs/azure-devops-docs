## Organizations

An organization in Azure DevOps corresponds to a business unit you define to support a set of services and users. It can be for your whole company, a specific business unit within your company, or just you. Each organization is associated with a separate URL, such as `https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam-engineering`, and is mostly isolated from other organizations.
