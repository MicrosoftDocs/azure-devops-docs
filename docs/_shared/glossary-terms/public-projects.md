## Public projects	

A project created within an Azure DevOps Services organization that is visible to the whole world. Everyone in the world can discover them and perform limited operations. Administrators can control who gets to fully contribute. Administrators can switch a project from private to public, and vice-versa, as described in [Change the project visibility](/azure/devops/organizations/public/make-project-public).
