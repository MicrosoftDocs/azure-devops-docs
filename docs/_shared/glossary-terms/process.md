## Process
A process defines the building blocks of a work-tracking system. To customize a process, you first create an inherited process from one of the default system processes, [Agile](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process), [Scrum](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process), or [CMMI](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process). All projects that use the process see the changes you make. To learn more, see [About process customization and inherited processes](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model).
