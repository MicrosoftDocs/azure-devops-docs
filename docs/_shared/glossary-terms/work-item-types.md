## Work item types (WITs) 

A WIT specifies the fields, workflow, and form used to track an item of work. Each WIT is associated with more than 30 system fields and several more type-specific fields. You use work items to plan and track the work required to develop your project. For an overview of predefined WITs provided with the default processes, see [Choose a process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process).
