## Work items

You plan and track work using work items. Specific types of work items show up on backlogs and boards. Each work item represents an instance of a work item type&mdash;such as a user story, feature, bug, or issue&mdash;that is assigned a unique identifier, an ID, which is unique across all projects defined in an organization.
