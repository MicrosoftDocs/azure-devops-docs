## Projects
A project, which was previously known as a *team project*, provides a repository for source code. A project provides a place where a group of people can plan, track progress, and collaborate on building software solutions. A project is defined for an Azure DevOps Services organization or within a TFS project collection. You can use it to focus on those objects defined within the project. To learn more, see [About projects and scaling your organization](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/about-projects).
