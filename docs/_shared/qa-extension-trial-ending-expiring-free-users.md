#### Q:	What should I do when the trial is almost expired or has ended for extensions that include free users?

A:	To keep or restore access to an extension that includes free users, 
[assign the extension up to the number of free users that you get](/azure/devops/marketplace/assign-paid-extensions). 
For additional users who need access, 
[buy the extension for these users from the Visual Studio Marketplace](/azure/devops/organizations/billing/change-number-paid-extension-users) 
and [assign the extension to these users](/azure/devops/marketplace/assign-paid-extensions), 
so they have access. Otherwise, non-free users will lose access 
when the extension trial expires.
