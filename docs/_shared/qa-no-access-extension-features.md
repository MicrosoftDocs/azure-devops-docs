#### Q: Why can't users access extension features?

A: This can happen for the following reasons: 

*	Most extensions require that users have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder. 
For example, you can install the free 
[Code Search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search), 
but each user must have at least Basic access to search for code. 
To help your team improve app quality, you can install the free 
[Test & Feedback extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-exploratorytesting-web), 
but you'll get different capabilities based on your access level 
and whether you work offline or connected to Azure DevOps Services or TFS. 
For more details, see the extension's description 
in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops), Azure DevOps tab.
