#### Q: What happened to my preview extension?

A: Your extension is no longer in preview and 
is now generally available as a paid extension, 
but offers a grace period before you have to buy the extension. 
All preview extensions will automatically convert to a 
[free trial](/azure/devops/billing/try-additional-features-vs) 
before you have to buy the extension.
