#### Q: What happens if my Azure subscription is disabled?

A: If you're the [Azure subscription Account Administrator](/azure/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator), 
check your subscription status in the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/), 
then try to [fix your subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-subscription-become-disable/).
