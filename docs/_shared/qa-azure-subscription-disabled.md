#### Q:	What happens if my Azure subscription is disabled?

A:	If you're the organization owner or 
[Azure subscription Account Administrator](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator), 
check your subscription status in the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/), 
then try to [fix your subscription](/azure/billing-subscription-become-disable). 
This will restore your paid settings. 
Or you can link your organization to another Azure subscription by 
[unlinking your organization from the disabled subscription](/azure/devops/billing/change-azure-subscription). 
While your subscription is disabled, your organization goes back to the free 
monthly limits until your subscription is fixed.
