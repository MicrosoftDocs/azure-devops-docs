#### Q:  Where can I check my bill or update billing details on my Azure subscription?

A:  If you're the Azure Account Administrator, 
[view your subscription at the Azure account portal](https://portal.azure.com).

#### Q: What if I have other questions about Azure subscriptions and billing?

A: Check the 
[Azure Billing and Subscription FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-subscription-faq/), 
or try [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).

#### Q: Why can't I link more organizations to my Azure subscription? What does the error "The resource is blocked to receive any update" mean?

A: There is a limit to the number of organizations that you can link to your Azure subscription.  After you add 25 organizations, Azure stops you from adding more organizations.
