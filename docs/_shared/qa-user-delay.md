#### Q: Why don't users appear or disappear promptly in Azure DevOps after I add or delete them in the Users hub?

A:	If you experience delays finding new users or having deleted users promptly removed from Azure DevOps (for example, in drop-down lists and groups) after you add or delete users, [file a problem report on Developer Community](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=820594) so we can investigate.
