####Q: Why don't users appear or disappear promptly in Team Services after I add or delete them in the Users hub?

A:	If you experience delays finding users or having them 
promptly removed from Team Services, like in drop-down 
lists and Team Services groups, after you add or delete 
them through the Users Hub, please 
[file a problem report on Developer Community](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=820594) 
so that we can investigate.
