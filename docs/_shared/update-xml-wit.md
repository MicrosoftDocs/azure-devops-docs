## Update the XML definition for a WIT 
If you are new to WIT customization, note the following: 
 
- To customize any aspect of a WIT requires updating the XML definition for the WIT. The WIT XML definition is described in [All WITD XML elements reference](/azure/devops/reference/xml/all-witd-xml-elements-reference)   
- If you are customizing the web form that uses the new work item experience, you'll want to reference the [WebLayout and Control elements](/azure/devops/reference/xml/weblayout-xml-elements)  
- If you are customizing a client form for use with Visual Studio, you'll want to reference the [Layout XML element reference](/azure/devops/reference/xml/layout-xml-element-reference) 
- Follow the sequence of steps outlined in [Customize the work item tracking web form](/azure/devops/reference/customize-wit-form).
