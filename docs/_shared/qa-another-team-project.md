#### Q:	Can I create more than one project?

A: Yes, multiple projects help you keep work separate when you have development projects for different teams. Only one project collection is supported.

To create projects, you need project collection administrator or organization owner permissions. For details, see [Create a project](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project).

To learn more about projects and when you should or shouldn't add one, see [About projects and scaling your organization](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/about-projects).
