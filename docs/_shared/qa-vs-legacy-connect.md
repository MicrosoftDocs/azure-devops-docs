#### Q: Can I use earlier versions of Visual Studio to connect to Azure DevOps?

A: Yes, you can use Visual Studio 2013 or 2012. You can also use Visual Studio 2010, 
but you'll need to install [Service Pack 1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=34677) 
and [KB2662296](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2662296) first. Or, you can use Visual 
Studio 2008 SP1, with [this GDR update](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2673642). 
Launch Visual Studio, then connect to Azure DevOps  
and select your project.
