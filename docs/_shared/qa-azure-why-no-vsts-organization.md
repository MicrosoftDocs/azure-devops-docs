#### Q:  Why don't I see my organization in the Azure portal?

A:  In both Azure portals, you must have
[Azure Service Administrator or Co-administrator](/azure/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator) 
permissions for the Azure subscription that's linked to your organization in Azure DevOps.
Also, in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you must have project collection administrator or organization owner permissions.
