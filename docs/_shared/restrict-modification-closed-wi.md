Depending on your business processes, you may want to prevent users from continuing to modify or update work items that have been closed or completed. You can add rules to work item types to prevent users from re-opening closed work items. 

To learn how, see this blog post, [Prevent reopening work item once closed](http://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/prevent-reopening-work-item-once-closed-azure-devops-with-video/).

> [!NOTE] 
> The blog post addresses how to add a custom rule to an Inherited process, however, the idea can be equally applied by adding one or more custom rules to an Online XML process and work item type definitions. To learn more, see [Apply a field rule](/azure/devops/reference/xml/apply-rule-work-item-field).
