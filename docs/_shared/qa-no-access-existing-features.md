#### Q: Why can't users access some features?

A:	Make sure that users have the correct 
[access level](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/compare-features/) 
in the Users hub. For VSTS, learn [how to manage users and access levels](/vsts/accounts/add-account-users-assign-access-levels). 
For TFS, learn [learn how to change access levels](/vsts/organizations/security/change-access-levels).  

Also, [some features are available only as extensions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/compare-features/), 
so you'll need to install these extensions. Most extensions require that you have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder.
Check the extension's description in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com). 

For example, to search your code, you can install the free 
[Code Search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search) 
but you'll need at least Basic access to use the extension. 
To help your team improve app quality, you can install the free 
[Test & Feedback extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-exploratorytesting-web), 
but you'll get different capabilities based on your access level 
and whether you work offline or connected to VSTS or TFS. 
To create test plans in the Test hub, you'll need to install the 
[Test Manager extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web). 
Some [Visual Studio subscribers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web) 
can use this extension for free, but users with Basic access will need paid extension access before they can use Test Manager. 
Learn [how to get extensions for VSTS](/vsts/marketplace/install-vsts-extension) or 
[how to get extensions for TFS](/vsts/marketplace/get-tfs-extensions). Also, learn 
[how to buy access to the TFS Test hub](/vsts/billing/buy-access-tfs-test-hub).
