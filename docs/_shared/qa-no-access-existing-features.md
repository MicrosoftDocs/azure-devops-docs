#### Q: Why can't users access some features?

A: Make sure that users have the correct [access level](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/compare-features/) assigned to them.  

* Learn [how to manage users and access levels for Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/add-organization-users).

* Learn [how to change access levels for Team Foundation Server](/azure/devops/organizations/security/change-access-levels).

Some features are available only as [extensions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/compare-features/). You need to install these extensions. Most extensions require you to have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder access. Check the extension's description in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops), Azure DevOps tab.

For example, to search your code, you can install the free [Code Search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search), but you need at least Basic access to use the extension.

To help your team improve app quality, you can install the free [Test & Feedback extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-exploratorytesting-web), but you get different capabilities based on your access level and whether you work offline or connected to Azure DevOps Services or Team Foundation Server (TFS).

Some [Visual Studio subscribers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web) can use this feature for free, but Basic users need to upgrade to Basic + Test Plans access before they can create test plans.
