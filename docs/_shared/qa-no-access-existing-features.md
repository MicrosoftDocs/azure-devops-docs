#### Q: Why can't users access some features?

A: Make sure that users have the correct [access level](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/compare-features/) assigned to them.  

* Learn [how to manage users and access levels for Azure DevOps](../organizations/accounts/add-organization-users.md).

* Learn [how to change access levels for Team Foundation Server](/azure/devops/organizations/security/change-access-levels).

Some features are available only as [extensions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/compare-features/). You need to install these extensions. Most extensions require you to have at least Basic access, not Stakeholder access. Check the extension's description in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com), Azure DevOps tab.

For example, to search your code, you can install the free [Code Search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-code-search), but you need at least Basic access to use the extension.

To help your team improve app quality, you can install the free [Test & Feedback extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-exploratorytesting-web), but you get different capabilities based on your access level and whether you work offline or connected to Azure DevOps Services or Team Foundation Server (TFS).

To create test plans, install the [Test Manager extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web). Some [Visual Studio subscribers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-testmanager-web) can use this extension for free, but users with Basic access need paid extension access before they can use Test Manager.
