> [!NOTE]   
> Your first project was created by using a Git repository and the [Agile process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process). If you want a project that uses the Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repository or the Scrum or CMMI process, see [Choose a process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process) for a comparison of processes. Then, you can choose a process by [adding another project](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project). 

Select one of the following tasks to get started:  
- **Boards** to begin [adding work items](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/view-add-work-items).
- **Repos** to open the [Repos > Files](/azure/devops/repos/git/clone) page. There, you can clone or import a repository or [initialize a README file](/azure/devops/project/wiki/project-vision-status) for your project summary page.
- **Pipelines** to start [defining a pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/index).
- **Test Plans** to start [defining test plans and test suites](/azure/devops/test/create-a-test-plan).
- [Manage your services](/azure/devops/settings/set-services) to disable the visibility of one or more services.

To get started managing your project, see [Get started as an administrator](/azure/devops/user-guide/project-admin-tutorial).
