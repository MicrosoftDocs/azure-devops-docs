An organization is created based on the account you used to sign in. Sign in to your organization at any time, (`https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}`).

You can rename and delete your organization, or change the organization location. To learn more, see the following articles:

- [Rename an organization](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/rename-organization)
- [Change the location of your organization](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-organization-location)

If you signed in with an existing Microsoft account, your next step is to [Create a project](/azure/devops/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates#CreateProject). If you signed in with a newly created Microsoft account, then your project is automatically created and named after your account name. To learn more about managing projects, see [Manage projects](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/about-projects).
