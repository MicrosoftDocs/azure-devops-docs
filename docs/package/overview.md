# Package Management in VSTS and TFS

**VSTS** | **TFS 2018** | **TFS 2017**

> [!NOTE]
> Package Management is an **[extension](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=723595)** that hosts NuGet, npm, and Maven packages alongside all your other VSTS assets: source code, builds, releases, etc.
> The extension must be installed from the Marketplace to create or consume packages.

## Package Management Overview

Package Management introduces the concept of multiple *feeds* that can be used to organize and control access to your packages. If you're familiar with using packages from [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org) or [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com), you can think of those places each as a single feed. 

A note on terminology: you may also have heard feeds called package *repositories* or package *sources*, especially if you're an npm or Maven user.

## Get started using Package Management
Get up and running with NuGet, npm, and Maven in VSTS and TFS in just a few minutes with the [NuGet quick start](get-started-nuget.md), [npm quick start](get-started-npm.md), and [Maven quick start](get-started-maven.md).

If you haven't used packages before, see the [conceptual introduction](index.md). When you're ready to get started, [install and license Package Management](install.md).
