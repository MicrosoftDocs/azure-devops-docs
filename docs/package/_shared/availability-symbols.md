> [!NOTE]
> A symbol server is available with Package Management in **VSTS** and works best with **Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 or later**. 
> 
> **Team Foundation Server** users and users without the Package Management extension can publish symbols to a file share using a [build task](/vsts/build-release/tasks/build/index-sources-publish-symbols).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use symbol server, ensure you've [installed Package Management](../install.md), [enabled the symbol server preview](../install.md#symbol-server), and assigned a license for each user that will consume symbols.
