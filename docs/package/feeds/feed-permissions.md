# Secure feeds using permissions

**VSTS | TFS 2017**

## Feed permissions overview
Feeds have three levels of access: Owners, Contributors, and Readers. Owners can add any type of identity&mdash;individuals, teams, and groups&mdash;to any access level.

| Permission | Reader | Contributor | Owner |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| List and restore/install packages             | &#x2713; | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Push packages                                 |          | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Unlist/deprecate packages                     |          | &#x2713; | &#x2713; |
| Delete/unpublish package                      |          |          | &#x2713; |
| Edit feed permissions                         |          |          | &#x2713; | 
| [Rename and delete feed](edit-feed.md)        |          |          | &#x2713; |

By default, the Project Collection Build Service is a Contributor and your project team is a Reader.
