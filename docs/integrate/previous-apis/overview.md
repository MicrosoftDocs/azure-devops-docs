# REST API Overview for TFS 2015, 2017, and 2018 (RTW and Update 1)

The Team Foundation Server APIs are based on REST, JSON and service hooks - all standard web technologies broadly supported in the industry.

> [!NOTE]
> The REST APIs documented here are for older versions of the APIs (TFS 2015 up to TFS 2018 Update 1). The newest versions can be found in the [Azure DevOps Services REST API documentation](/rest/api/vsts). 

This article walks you through:

- The basic components of a REST API request/response pair.
- Overviews of creating and sending a REST request, and handling the response.

## Components of a REST API request/response pair

A REST API request/response pair can be separated into five components:

1. The **request URI**, in the following form: `VERB https://{server:port}/tfs[/{collection}[/{team-project}]/_apis[/{area}]/{resource}?api-version={version}`
   * *collection*: The name of the collection, like `DefaultCollection`.
   * *resource path*: The collection should be followed by `_apis/{area}/{resource}`. For example, `_apis/wit/workitems`.
   * *api-version*: Every API request should include an api-version to avoid having your app or service break as APIs evolve. api-versions are in the following format: `{major}.{minor}[-{stage}[.{resource-version}]]`, for example:
       * `api-version=1.0`
       * `api-version=1.2-preview`
       * `api-version=2.0-preview.1`

     > Note: *area* and *team-project* are optional, depending on the API request. Check out the [TFS to REST API version mapping matrix](#api-and-tfs-version-mapping) below to find which REST API versions apply to your version of TFS.

2. HTTP **request message header** fields:
    * A required [HTTP method](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) (also known as an operation or verb), which tells the service what type of operation you are requesting. Azure REST APIs support GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, and PATCH methods.
    * Optional additional header fields, as required by the specified URI and HTTP method. For example, an Authorization header that provides a bearer token containing client authorization information for the request.
3. Optional HTTP **request message body** fields, to support the URI and HTTP operation. For example, POST operations contain MIME-encoded objects that are passed as complex parameters. 
    * For POST or PUT operations, the MIME-encoding type for the body should be specified in the Content-type request header as well. Some services require you to use a specific MIME type, such as `application/json`.
4. HTTP **response message header** fields:
    * An [HTTP status code](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html), ranging from 2xx success codes to 4xx or 5xx error codes. Alternatively, a service-defined status code may be returned, as indicated in the API documentation.
    * Optional additional header fields, as required to support the request's response, such as a `Content-type` response header.
5. Optional HTTP **response message body** fields:
    * MIME-encoded response objects may be returned in the HTTP response body, such as a response from a GET method that is returning data. Typically, these objects are returned in a structured format such as JSON or XML, as indicated by the `Content-type` response header. For example, when you request an access token from Azure AD, it will be returned in the response body as the `access_token` element, one of several name/value paired objects in a data collection. In this example, a response header of `Content-Type: application/json` is also included.


## Create the request

### Authenticate 

There are many ways to authenticate your application or service with Team Services or TFS. The following table is an excellent way to decide which method is the best for you:

| Type of application | Description | example |Authentication mechanism | Code samples |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|-------------------------|--------|
| Interactive client-side  | GUI based client side application | Windows app enumerating bugs for a user | [Active Directory authentication library (ADAL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries) | [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-auth-samples/tree/master/ManagedClientConsoleAppSample) |
| Interactive Javascript | GUI based Javascript application | AngularJS single page app displaying work items for a user | [ADAL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-libraries) | sample (coming soon) |
| Non-interactive client-side | Headless text only client side application | Console app displaying all bugs assigned to a user | [Device Profile](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/active-directory-dotnet-deviceprofile/?v=17.23h) | [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-auth-samples/tree/master/DeviceProfileSample) |
| Interactive web | GUI based web application | Custom Web dashboard displaying build summaries |[OAuth](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth) | [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-auth-samples/tree/master/OAuthWebSample) |
| TFS application | TFS app using the Client OM library | TFS extension displaying team bug dashboards | [Client Libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/dotnet-client-libraries) | [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-auth-samples/tree/master/ClientLibraryConsoleAppSample) |
| [TFS Extension](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/integrate/extensions/get-started/node#files) | TFS extension | [Agile Cards](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=spartez.agile-cards) | [VSS Web Extension SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/vss-web-extension-sdk) | [sample walkthrough](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/integrate/extensions/develop/add-dashboard-widget) |

> [!NOTE]
> You can find more information on authentication on our [authentication guidance page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/authentication-guidance).

### Assemble the request

For TFS, `instance` is `{server:port}/tfs` and by default the port is 8080. The default collection is `DefaultCollection`, but can be any collection.

Here's how to get a list of team projects from TFS using the default port and collection.

```dos
curl -u {username}[:{personalaccesstoken}] https://{server}:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/projects?api-version=2.0
```

The examples above use personal access tokens, which requires that you [create a personal access token](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md).

## Process the response

You should get a response like this.

```json

    "value": [

                "url": "https: //fabrikam-fiber-inc:8080/_apis/projectCollections/d81542e4-cdfa-4333-b082-1ae2d6c3ad16",
                "collectionUrl": "https: //fabrikam-fiber-inc:8080/DefaultCollection"
            },
            "defaultTeam": {
                "id": "8bd35c5e-30bb-4834-a0c4-d576ce1b8df7",
                "name": "Fabrikam-Fiber-GitTeam",
                "url": "https: //fabrikam-fiber-inc:8080/DefaultCollection/_apis/projects/6ce954b1-ce1f-45d1-b94d-e6bf2464ba2c/teams/8bd35c5e-30bb-4834-a0c4-d576ce1b8df7"
            }
        }
    ],
    "count": 2
}
```

The response is [JSON](https://json.org/). That's generally what you'll get back from the REST APIs although there are a few exceptions,
like [Git blobs](git/blobs.md).

Now you should be able to look around the specific API areas like [work item tracking](wit/overview.md) or [Git](git/overview.md) and get to the resources that you need. Keep reading to learn more about the general patterns that are used in these APIs.

## API and TFS version mapping

Below you'll find a quick mapping of REST API versions and their corresponding TFS releases. All API versions will work on the server version mentioned as well as later versions.
