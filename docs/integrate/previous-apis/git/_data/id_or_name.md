> [!NOTE] 
> Repositories have both a name and an identifier.
> Identifiers are globally unique, but several projects may contain a repository of the same name.
> You don't need to include the project if you specify a repository by ID.
> However, if you specify a repository by name, you must also specify the project (by name or ID).
