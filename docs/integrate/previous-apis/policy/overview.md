# Policy
[!INCLUDE [API_version](../_data/version2-preview1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [disclaimer](../_data/disclaimer.md)]

If you havenâ€™t already, look at the information on getting started with these APIs and our documentation on [branch policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=615252). Use these APIs to define policies for your projects. 
[Configurations](./configurations.md) associate a [type](./types.md), such as "Required reviewers", with specific [settings](./settings.md), such as  "For pull requests with files named *.dll targeting the master branch in the Fabrikam Git repository, add the Source-Controlled Binaries Team as a required reviewer".
