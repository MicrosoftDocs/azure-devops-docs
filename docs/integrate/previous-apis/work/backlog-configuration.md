# Backlog Configuration

<b>Team Services</b> 

[!INCLUDE [API_version](../_data/version3-preview1.md)]

[!INCLUDE [GET_STARTED](../_data/get-started.md)]

There are three classes of backlogs:
1. Portfolio backlogs that track high-level features, scenarios, or epics.
2. A product or requirement backlog that contains a prioritized list of user stories, deliverables, or work you plan to build or fix.
3. An iteration or sprint backlog that each team is working on during a scheduled sprint.

The hierarchy of work items follows the order above. Work item types on the portfolio levels (e.g. Scenarios) are at the top and work item types on the iteration backlog are on the bottom (e.g. Tasks). For more information on backlogs, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/work/backlogs-boards-plans).
