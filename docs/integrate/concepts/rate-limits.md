# Rate limits

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Azure DevOps, like many software-as-a-service solutions, uses multi-tenancy to reduce costs and improve performance. This design leaves users vulnerable to performance issues and even outages when other users, of their shared resources, have spikes in their consumption.
To combat these problems, Azure DevOps limits the resources individuals can consume, and the amount of requests they can make to certain commands.
When these limits are exceeded, future requests may be either delayed or blocked.

When a user's requests are delayed by a significant amount, that user gets an email and sees a warning banner in the web.
For the build service account and others without an email address, members of the Project Collection Administrators group get the email.
For more information, see [Usage monitoring](../../organizations/accounts/usage-monitoring.md).

When an individual user's requests get blocked, responses with HTTP code 429 (too many requests) are received, with a message similar to the following message:

```TF400733: The request has been canceled: Request was blocked due to exceeding usage of resource <resource name> in namespace <namespace ID>.```

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Git limits](../../repos/git/limits.md)

## Current rate limits

Azure DevOps currently has a global consumption limit.
This limit delays requests from individual users beyond a threshold when shared resources are in danger of being overwhelmed.

### Global consumption limit

This limit is focused exclusively on avoiding outages when shared resources are close to being overwhelmed.
Individual users typically only have their requests delayed when one of the following occurs:

- One of their shared resources is at risk of being overwhelmed
- Their personal usage exceeds 200 times the consumption of a typical user within a (sliding) five-minute window

The amount of the delay depends on the user's sustained level of consumption.
Delays range from a few milliseconds per request up to 30 seconds.
Once consumption goes to zero or the resource is no longer overwhelmed, the delays stop within five minutes.
If consumption remains high, delays may continue indefinitely to protect the resource.

#### Azure DevOps throughput units (TSTUs)  

Azure DevOps users consume many shared resources, and consumption depends on many factors. For example:

- Uploading a large number of files to version control creates a large amount of load on databases and storage accounts.
- Complex work item tracking queries create database load based on the number of work items they search through.
- Builds drive load by downloading files from version control, producing log output, and so on.
- All operations consume CPU and memory on various parts of the service.

To accommodate all of this, Azure DevOps resource consumption is expressed in abstract units called Azure DevOps throughput units, or TSTUs.  

TSTUs eventually incorporate a blend of the following:

- [Azure SQL Database DTUs](/azure/azure-sql/database/purchasing-models) as a measure of database consumption
- Application tier and job agent CPU, memory, and I/O as a measure of compute consumption
- Azure Storage bandwidth as a measure of storage consumption  

For now, TSTUs are primarily focused on Azure SQL Database DTUs, since Azure SQL Databases are the shared resources most commonly overwhelmed by excessive consumption.

A single TSTU is the average load we expect a single normal user of Azure DevOps to generate per five minutes.
Normal users also generate spikes in load.
These spikes are typically 10 or fewer TSTUs per five minutes.
Less frequently, spikes go as high as 100 TSTUs.
The global consumption limit is 200 TSTUs within a sliding five-minute window.

## Pipelines

Rate limiting is similar for Azure Pipelines.
Each pipeline is treated as an individual entity with its own resource consumption tracked.
Even if build agents are self-hosted, they generate load in the form of cloning and sending logs.

We apply a 200 TSTU limit for an individual pipeline in a sliding 5-minute window. This limit is the same as the global consumption limit for users.
If a pipeline is delayed or blocked by rate limiting, a message appears in the attached logs.

### Work item tracking request limits

This limit restricts individual users to 5,000 work item tracking (WIT) commands per hour per organization. When this rate is exceeded, additional WIT commands will be blocked. When
the user falls back below this rate, the blocking will stop. It is important to note that the hour window is a sliding window.

To avoid disruption of existing applications, the following commands are temporarily added to an allow list:

- ```GetWorkItem```
- ```PageWorkitemsById```

To avoid hitting these limits, we recommend:

- Using the reporting APIs (Work item revisions and Work item links) instead of GetWorkItem and PageWorkitemsById.
- Saving work item changes in batches, rather than one at a time.
- Reducing the frequency of running applications which make many WIT requests.

As discussed above, we expect to add additional rate limits over time. And we always reserve the right to slow down or block usage which we believe to be abusive.

## API client experience

When requests are delayed or blocked, Azure DevOps returns response headers to help API clients react.
While not fully standardized, these headers are [broadly in line with other popular services](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16022624/examples-of-http-api-rate-limiting-http-response-headers).

The following table lists the headers available and what they mean.
Except for `X-RateLimit-Delay`, all of these headers get sent before requests start getting delayed.
This design gives clients the opportunity to proactively slow down their rate of requests.

      **Header name**

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `Retry-After`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
       The [RFC 6585](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4")-specified header sent to tell you how long to wait before you send your next request to fall under the detection threshold. Units: seconds.

      `X-RateLimit-Resource`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
       A custom header indicating the service and type of threshold that was reached. Threshold types and service names may vary over time and without warning. We recommend displaying this string to a human, but not relying on it for computation.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      `X-RateLimit-Limit`

   :::column span="1":::
      `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
       Number of TSTUs remaining before being delayed. If requests are already being delayed or blocked, it's 0.

   :::column span="1":::
       `X-RateLimit-Reset`
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
       Time at which, if all resource consumption stopped immediately, tracked usage would return to 0 TSTUs. Expressed in Unix epoch time.

### Recommendations

We recommend that you at least respond to the `Retry-After` header. If you detect a `Retry-After` header in any response, wait until that amount of time has passed before sending another request. Doing so helps your client application experience fewer enforced delays. Keep in mind that the response is 200, so you don't need to apply retry logic to the request.

If possible, we further recommend that you monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Limit` headers.

Doing so allows you to approximate how quickly you're approaching the delay threshold.

Your client can intelligently react by spreading out its requests over time.
