## General
<a name="marketplace"></a>
#### Q: How do I add my extension to the Visual Studio Marketplace?

A: The Visual Studio Marketplace is currently in preview. Continue managing your Visual Studio extensions through the [Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/). Once the Marketplace is ready, your extension will be automatically migrated to the Marketplace.


<a name="add_2013_support"></a>
#### Q: I have a Visual Studio 2015 Extension, how do I add Visual Studio 2013 support for it?

A: Reference the 2013 assembly when you build instead of the 2015 assembly. Visual Studio 2015 contains a binding redirect to ensure it continues to work when you run it within Visual Studio 2015.
