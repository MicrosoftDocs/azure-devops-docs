# I want to extend the UI

There are many reasons you may want to customize (or extend) the UI, either for yourself or your workgroup. You may just need to add a button here or there, or you may want to create an entirely custom interface. These links are a good starting place:
* [Extending Menus and Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/legacy-language-service-essentials)
* [Adding a Button to a Toolbar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/adding-a-command-to-the-solution-explorer-toolbar)
* [Adding Commands to Toolbars](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/adding-commands-to-toolbars)
