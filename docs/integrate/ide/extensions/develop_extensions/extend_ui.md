# I want to extend the UI

There are many reasons you may want to customize (or extend) the UI, either for yourself or your workgroup. You may just need to add a button here or there, or you may want to create an entirely custom interface. These links are a good starting place:
* [Extending Menus and Commands](/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/legacy-language-service-essentials)
* [Adding a Button to a Toolbar](/visualstudio/extensibility/adding-a-command-to-the-solution-explorer-toolbar)
* [Adding Commands to Toolbars](/visualstudio/extensibility/adding-commands-to-toolbars)
* [Extending and Customizing Tool Windows](/visualstudio/extensibility/extending-and-customizing-tool-windows)
