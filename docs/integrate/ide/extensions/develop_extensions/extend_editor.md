# I want to extend the Editor

The Editor provides extension points that you can extend as Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) component parts. These are the main extension point categories:
* Content types
* Classification types and classification formats
* Margins and scrollbars
* Tags 
* Adornments
* Mouse processors
* Drop handlers
* Options
* IntelliSense

To learn more about each point category, see [Editor Extension Points](/visualstudio/extensibility/language-service-and-editor-extension-points).
