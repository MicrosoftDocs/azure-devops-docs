# Extensibility samples on GitHub

There are many code samples available to you in our Git repository.  The repo has a full list of all available samples. Start by exploring the repo and cloning it to your local machine.

The samples demonstrate how to customize the appearance and behavior of the Visual Studio IDE and editor: 
* Add commands, buttons, menus, and other UI elements to the IDE
* Add tool windows for new functionality
* Add support in Visual Studio for new programming languages
* Add refactoring or language analyzers to fix and improve code
* Add a custom project type or new project or item templates
* Enable high-DPI/high-resolution, theme-aware, and high-contrast images and icons in your UI
* Use the Image Service/Catalog
