# Integrate applications  

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You can build custom applications or services that integrate with Azure DevOps by using the **REST APIs** to make direct HTTP calls, or use our **.NET Client Libraries**.

Along with interacting with Azure DevOps in your application, you can also integrate with popular non-Microsoft services such as Slack or Jenkins.

To get started, see the following articles: 

- [Create a bug](./quickstarts/create-bug-quickstart.md)
- [Get work items using queries](./quickstarts/work-item-quickstart.md)

## Integrate applications with Azure DevOps

Integrate Azure DevOps with other tools and services to not only enhance team collaboration but also streamline workflows across the software development lifecycle. Whether you're building custom integrations or using off-the-shelf services, it's essential that you understand the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites for integration

Before you start the integration process, ensure you have the following items: 

- **Access:** Ensure proper permissions and use secure authentication.
- **API knowledge:** Understand Azure DevOps REST API and the target tool API. 
- **Data mapping:** Identify and align fields and data types between systems to ensure compatibility in field names, formats, and value ranges. 
- **Network and connectivity:** Ensure your network supports API calls, webhook notifications, and connectivity between Azure DevOps and self-hosted tools.
