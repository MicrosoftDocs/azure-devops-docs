# Integrate applications  

[!INCLUDE [version-all](../includes/version-vsts-tfs-2018.md)]

You can build custom applications or services that integrate with Azure DevOps by using the **REST APIs** to make direct HTTP calls, or use our **.NET Client Libraries**.

Along with interacting with Azure DevOps in your application, you can also integrate with popular third-party services such as Slack or Jenkins.

To get started, see: 

- [Create a bug](./quickstarts/create-bug-quickstart.md)
- [Get work items using queries](./quickstarts/work-item-quickstart.md)
