# Integrating with VSTS and Team Foundation Server

You can build custom applications or services that integrate with your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS) accounts by using the **REST APIs** to make direct HTTP calls, or utilize our **.NET Client Libraries**.

Along with interacting with VSTS or TFS in your application, you can also integrate with popular third-party services such as Slack or Jenkins.
