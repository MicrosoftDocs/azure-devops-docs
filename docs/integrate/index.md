# Integrate applications  

You can build custom applications or services that integrate with your Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server (TFS) accounts by using the **REST APIs** to make direct HTTP calls, or utilize our **.NET Client Libraries**.

Along with interacting with Azure DevOps Services or TFS in your application, you can also integrate with popular third-party services such as Slack or Jenkins.
