#### VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | VS 2017 | VS 2015 | VS 2013

Administrators of Team Foundation version control can add, configure, and remove check-in notes. Check-in notes settings are set in the Source Control Settings window. For more information about check-ins, see [Check In Pending Changes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181411).

**Required Permissions**  
To complete this procedure, you must have the **Edit project-level information** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../security/permissions.md).

2.  In the **Source Control Settings** dialog box, choose the **Check-in Notes** tab, and click **Add**.  
3.  In the **Add Check-in Note** dialog box, in the **Title** box, either type the desired name (for example, Documentation Reviewer), or select an existing check-in note from the drop-down list.  
4.  If you want the note to be mandatory for check-ins, select the **Required on check-ins** box.  
5.  Click **Add**, to return to the **Check-in Notes** tab in the **Source Control Settings** window with the new check-in note title added.
