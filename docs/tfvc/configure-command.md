Enables an administrator to view and change the following configuration settings for a team project in the **Source Control Settings** dialog box:

-   Check-out settings

-   Check-in policies

-   Check-in notes

**Required Permissions**

To use the **configure** command, you must have the **Edit server-level information** permission set to **Allow**. For more information, see [Permissions and groups reference](../security/permissions.md).

    tf configure [PathOfTeamProject] [/collection:TeamProjectCollectionUrl][/login:username,[password]]

## Parameters

|**Argument**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|*PathOfTeamProject*|Path of the team project whose configuration settings an administrator can view, change, or both.|
|*TeamProjectCollectionUrl*|The URL of the team project collection that contains the team project that you specified (for example, http://myserver:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection).|
|*username*|Provides a value to the **/login** option. You can specify a username value as either *DOMAIN\UserName* or *UserName.*|

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**/collection**|Specifies the team project collection.|
|**/login**|Specifies the user name and password to authenticate the user with Team Foundation Server.|

## Remarks

You can manage the following team project settings using the **configure** command:

-   **Check-out settings** can be used to determine whether multiple users can edit files at the same time. Also, they can be used to configure the get latest on check-out behavior.

-   **Check-in policies** provide controls that are invoked at check-in time, to make sure that defined criteria are met before a user checks in pending changes.

-   **Check-in notes** define custom fields into which users provide information during the check-in process. Check-in notes can be either required or optional.

The settings are configured in the **Source Control Settings** dialog box which appears after you run the **configure** command. When you complete your changes, click **OK** to save them to the server.

For more information about these settings, see [Walkthrough: Customizing Checkin Policies and Notes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181281).
