Discards one or more pending changes to files or folders.

**Requirements:** See [Permissions and groups reference](../security/permissions.md).

    tf undo [/workspace:workspacename[;workspaceowner]]
    [/recursive] itemspec [/noprompt] [/login:username,[password]]
    [/collection:TeamProjectCollectionUrl]

## Parameters


<table><thead>

<tr>
	<td><p><strong>/collection</strong> : <em>TeamProjectCollectionUrl</em></p></td>
	<td><p>Specifies the URL of the team project collection that contains the items. For example: http://myserver:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection.</p><p>If you do not use the <strong>/workspace</strong> option, by default the team project collection is presumed to be the one that contains the workspace that maps the current directory.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><em>itemspec</em></p></td>
	<td><p>Specifies the scope of the items. You can specify more than one <em>itemspec</em> argument. For syntax, see <a href="use-team-foundation-version-control-commands.md">Use Team Foundation version control commands</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><strong>/login</strong></p></td>
	<td><p>Specifies the user account to use to run the command. See <a href="use-team-foundation-version-control-commands.md">Use Team Foundation version control commands</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><strong>/noprompt</strong></p></td>
	<td><p>Suppresses the display of windows and dialog boxes and redirects output data to the command prompt. See <a href="use-team-foundation-version-control-commands.md">Use Team Foundation version control commands</a>.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><strong>/recursive</strong></p></td>
	<td><p>Recursively undoes changes to items in the specified directory and any subdirectories.</p></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><strong>/workspace</strong> <em>workspacename</em>[;<em>workspaceowner</em>]</p></td>
	<td><p>Specifies the name of the workspace in which you want to undo pending changes. If not specified, the workspace is the one that maps the current directory.</p><p>You can specify <em>workspaceowner</em> to undo a pending change in a workspace that belongs to a specific user. If not specified, the workspace is presumed to be the current user, or if specified, the <strong>/login:</strong><em>username</em>. You must have the UndoOther permission set to Allow to undo changes in another user's workspace.</p><table><thead>
<tr><th><strong>Note</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr>
	<td><p>If you use the <strong>undo</strong> command to undo a pending change in a remote workspace that is still in use, then before continuing work in that workspace, a user must log on to the machine that hosts the workspace and then get (and in some cases <a href="get-command.md">get /all</a>) the items affected by the undo.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody>

## Remarks

For each item on which there is a pending [edit](check-out-edit-files.md) change, the **undo** command determines if the file has been modified on disk. If the file has been modified and the **/noprompt** option has not been specified, the system prompts you to confirm that you want to proceed. Choose the **N** key to leave the change in place, the **Y** key to proceed with only the current change, or the **A** key to proceed with this and any other modified files that are subsequently detected.

The **undo** command removes any [locks](work-version-control-locks.md) on the items.

## Examples

### Remove pending changes to a file

    c:\code\SiteApp\Main\SolutionA\Project1>tf undo program.cs

Removes all pending changes to program.cs.

### Recursively remove pending changes to all items in a folder

    c:\code\SiteApp\Main>tf undo * /recursive

Removes all pending changes in the c:\\code\\SiteApp\\Main folder and all its subfolders.

### Remove pending changes to a file in a remote workspace

    c:\>tf undo /collection:http://fabrikam-3:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection
    /workspace:FABRIKAM-1;JuliaI $/SiteApp/Main/SolutionA/Project1/program.cs

Removes all pending changes to program.cs in the specified collection and workspace.

## Work in Visual Studio

-    [Develop code and manage pending changes](develop-code-manage-pending-changes.md)  Use Visual Studio to undo pending changes.

## Tips

-   To view a list of pending changes in the current or in a remote workspace, use the [Status command](status-command.md).  
-   You can use the **/workspace** option (and as needed, the **/collection** option) to undo changes on a remote dev machine. This capability is especially useful in cases when, for example, a file has been checked out and possibly locked on a dev machine that you cannot access. See the above explanation of the **/workspace** for information about how this works.  
-   If you need to clean your workspace (for example, because your work is interrupted by a more urgent task) and want to preserve the pending changes instead of undoing them, you can suspend them. See [Shelve Command](shelve-command.md). You can also preserve the position of your open windows, breakpoints, and other important cues. See [Suspend your work and manage your shelvesets](suspend-your-work-manage-your-shelvesets.md).  
-   You can also discard changes that have already been checked in. See [Undelete Command](undelete-command.md) and [Rollback Command (Team Foundation Version Control)](rollback-command-team-foundation-version-control.md).
