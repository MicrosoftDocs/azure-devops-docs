> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Azure DevOps Demo Generator is discontinued**
> 
> Microsoft has discontinued further development and investment in the Azure DevOps Demo Generator. While this tool provided valuable functionality for creating preconfigured Azure DevOps projects with sample data, we're focusing our resources on other platform capabilities that better serve evolving customer needs.
>
> **Recommended alternatives:**
> - Create Azure DevOps projects manually using our [getting started guides](../../get-started/index.yml)
> - Use [Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md) for automated project setup
> - Explore [Azure DevOps REST APIs](../../integrate/index.md) for custom project creation scripts
