The purpose of this system is to simplify working with the hands-on-labs, demos and other education material provided by the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketing team. You can use it to experiment with different services and options in a personal, pre-configured sandbox, or to simply develop comfort with UI and workflows without impacting a production environment.
