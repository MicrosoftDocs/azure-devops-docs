The Azure DevOps Services Demo Generator helps you create projects in your organization with prepopulated sample content. The tool configures projects that include source code, work items, iterations, service connections, and build and release pipelines based on templates you select.

## What the Demo Generator provides

When you use the Demo Generator, it creates projects that contain:

- **Source code repositories** with sample applications and code structures
- **Work items** including user stories, tasks, and bugs with realistic data
- **Sprint iterations** with work items assigned across multiple sprints
- **Service connections** configured for various deployment scenarios
- **Build pipelines** set up with sample build definitions
- **Release pipelines** configured with deployment stages and approvals

## Getting started with the Demo Generator

Explore these resources to learn how to use the Azure DevOps Services Demo Generator:

- **[Use the Demo Generator](use-demo-generator-v2.md)** - Learn how to create sample projects using the Demo Generator interface
- **[Configure the Demo Generator](configure.md)** - Set up and run the Demo Generator as a console application or executable
- **[Build your own template](build-your-own-template.md)** - Create custom templates for specific scenarios and requirements

## Alternative approaches

Since the Demo Generator receives no further updates, consider these alternatives for creating sample projects:

- **Manual project creation** using Azure DevOps project templates
- **[Azure DevOps CLI](../cli/index.md)** for scripted project setup
- **[REST API automation](../integrate/index.md)** for custom project provisioning
- **Sample repositories** available in the Azure DevOps community

## Important considerations

Keep these factors in mind when using the Demo Generator:

- **No new features**: The tool receives no new templates or functionality updates
- **Limited support**: Microsoft provides minimal support for issues or questions
- **Legacy templates**: Existing templates might not reflect the latest Azure DevOps features
- **Migration planning**: Consider transitioning to alternative solutions for ongoing needs
