# Default TFVC permissions 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Once you have been added as a team member, you are a member of the Contributors group. This allows you to contribute to a TFVC repository. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. These groups are assigned the default permissions for contributing to the repository as listed below.

From the project admin content, **Version Control** page, you can [set permissions on a repository](set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/code-tfvc.md)]
