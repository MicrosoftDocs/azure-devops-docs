# Default Git repository and branch permissions

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Once you have been added as a team member, you are a member of the Contributors group. This allows you to contribute to a Git repository. The most common built-in groups include Readers, Contributors, and Project Administrators. These groups are assigned the default permissions for contributing to a branch or repository as listed below.

From the project admin content, **Version Control** page, you can [set permissions on a repository](set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md). 

From the team project admin content for Version Control, you can [set permissions on a repository](set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md). From the **Code>Branches** page, you can [set permissions for a specific branch and set branch policies](../git/branch-permissions.md).
