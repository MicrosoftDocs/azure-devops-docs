# Permissions and groups in VSTS and TFS

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

This topic provides a comprehensive reference for each built-in group and permission. To learn how to add users to a group or set a specific permission that you can manage through the web portal, see the following resources:

>[!NOTE]  
>The images you see from your web portal may differ from the images you see in this topic. These differences result from updates made to VSTS or your on-premises TFS. However, the basic functionality available to you remains the same unless explicitly mentioned. 



<a name="groups"></a>
## Groups

Permissions can be granted directly to an individual, or to a group.
Using groups can make things a lot simpler,
and TFS sets up some built-in groups for that purpose.
These groups and the permissions they're assigned to exist at several different levels:
server (TFS deployment), team project collection, team project, and specific objects.
You can also create your own groups and grant them the specific set of permissions
that are appropriate for certain roles in your organization.

<!---
Team Foundation Administrators
Team Foundation Proxy Service Accounts
Team Foundation Service Accounts
Team Foundation Valid Users
Project Server Integration Service Accounts

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Server-level groups 

When you install TFS, the system creates default groups that have [deployment-wide, server-level permissions](#server-permissions). You can neither remove nor delete the built-in server-level groups.

![ADMIN_GROUPS_PERMISSIONS](_img/permissions/server-groups-and-permissions.png)


You can't remove or delete the default server level groups.

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team administrator role

For each team that you add, you can assign one or more team members as administrators. The team admin role isn't a group with a set of defined permissions. Instead, the team admin role is tasked with managing  team assets. To learn more, see [About security roles, Team administrator role](about-security-roles.md#team-administrator-role). To add a user as a team administrator, see [Add a team administrator](../work/scale/add-team-administrator.md).

> [!NOTE]   
> Project Administrators can manage all team admin areas for all teams. 

## Permissions


The system manages permissions at different levels&mdash;server, collection, project, or object&mdash;and by default assigns them to one or more built-in groups. You manage most permissions through the web portal.

<a id="server">  </a>
<a id="server-permissions">  </a>

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Server-level 

You manage server-level permissions through the [Team Foundation Administration Console](../tfs-server/add-administrator-tfs.md) or [TFSSecurity command-line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md#permissions). Team Foundation Administrators are granted all server-level permissions. Other server-level groups have select permission assignments.

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project-level

You manage project-level permissions from the [web portal admin context](../user-guide/work-web-portal.md#admin-context) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md#team-project-level-permissions). Project Administrators are assigned all project-level permissions. Other project-level groups are assigned a subset of these permissions.

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build (object-level)

You manage build permissions [for each build defined in the web portal](../build-release/set-permissions.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md#build-permissions). Project Administrators are granted all build permissions and Build Administrators are assigned most of these permissions. You can set build permissions for all build definitions or for each build definition.

<img src="_img/permissions/build-permissions-vsts.png" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />


Permissions in Build follow a hierarchical model. Defaults for all the permissions can be set at the team project level and can be overridden on an individual build definition.

To set the permissions at project level for all build definitions in a project, choose **Security** from the action bar on the main page of Builds hub.

To set or override the permissions for a specific build definition, choose **Security** from the context menu of the build definition.

The following permissions are defined in Build. All of these can be set at both the levels.

<!---
Commenting this section out as it duplicates that defined in the following table.
| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Administer build permissions** | Can change any of the other permissions listed here. |
| **Queue builds** | Can queue new builds. |
| **Delete build definition** | Can delete build definition(s). |
| **Delete builds** | Can delete builds for a definition. Builds that are deleted are [retained](../build-release/concepts/policies/retention.md) in the **Deleted** tab for a period of time before they are destroyed. |
| **Destroy builds** | Can delete builds from the **Deleted** tab. |
| **Edit build definition** | Can save any changes to a build definition, including configuration variables, triggers, repositories, and retention policy. |
| **Edit build quality** | Can add tags to a build. |
| **Override check-in validation by build** | Applies to [TFVC gated check-in builds](../build-release/concepts/definitions/build/triggers.md). This does not apply to PR builds. |
| **Retain indefinitely** | Can toggle the retain indefinitely flag on a build. |
| **Stop builds** | Can stop builds queued by other team members or by the system.  |
| **View build definition** | Can view build definition(s). |
| **View builds** | Can view builds belonging to build definition(s). |
| **Update build information** | It is recommended to leave this alone. It's intended to enable service accounts, not team members. |
| **Manage build qualities** | _Only applies to XAML builds_ |
| **Manage build queue** | _Only applies to XAML builds_ |

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Area path (object-level)     

Area path permissions grant or restrict access to branches of the area hierarchy
and to the work items in those areas.
You manage the security of each area path from the [web portal](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md#area). Area permissions grant or restrict access to create and manage area paths as well as create and modify work items defined under area paths.

Members of the Project Administrators group are automatically granted permissions to manage area paths for a team project. Consider granting team administrators or team leads permissions to create, edit, or delete area nodes.


> [!NOTE]  
> Multiple teams may contribute to a team project.
> When that's the case, you can set up teams that are associated with an area.
> Permissions for the team's work items are assigned by assigning permissions to the area.
> There are other [team settings](../work/scale/manage-team-assets.md)

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iteration Path (object-level) 

Iteration path permissions grant or restrict access to create and manage iteration paths.

Multiple teams may contribute to a team project. 
When that's the case, you can set up teams that are associated with an area. 
Permissions for the team's work items are assigned by assigning permissions to the area. 
There are other [team settings](../work/scale/manage-team-assets.md) 
that configure the team's agile planning tools.
To learn more, see [Set permissions to restrict access to work items](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).

You manage the security of each iteration path from the [web portal](../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md) or using the [TFSSecurity command-line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md#iteration-permissions). 

Members of the Project Administrators group are automatically granted these permissions for each iteration defined for a team project. Consider granting team administrators, scrum masters, or team leads permissions to create, edit, or delete iteration nodes.

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release (object-level) 

If you are working with the Release Management client and server supported for TFS 2015, see [Automate deployments with Release Management](../release/previous-version/release-management-overview.md).

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2017"

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Release (object-level) 

You manage permissions [for each release defined in the web portal](../build-release/set-permissions.md). Project Administrators and Release Administrators are granted all release management permissions. These permissions can be granted or denied in a hierarchical model at the team project level, for a specific release definition, or for a specific environment in a release definition. Within this hierarchy, permissions can be inherited from the parent or overridden.

In addition, you can assign approvers to specific steps within a release definition to ensure that the applications being deployed meet quality standards.

The following permissions are defined in Release Management. The scope column explains whether the permission can be set at the team project, release definition, or environment level.

| Permission | Description | Scopes |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Administer release permissions** | Can change any of the other permissions listed here. | Project, Release definition, Environment |
| **Create releases** | Can create new releases. | Project, Release definition |
| **Delete release definition** | Can delete release definition(s). | Project, Release definition |
| **Delete release environment** | Can delete environment(s) in release definition(s). | Project, Release definition, Environment |
| **Delete releases** | Can delete releases for a definition. | Project, Release definition |
| **Edit release definition** | Can save any changes to a release definition, including configuration variables, triggers, artifacts, and retention policy as well as configuration within an environment of the release definition. To make changes to a specific environment in a release definition, the user also needs **Edit release environment** permission. | Project, Release definition |
| **Edit release environment** | Can edit environment(s) in release definition(s). To save the changes to the release definition, the user also needs **Edit release definition** permission. This permission also controls whether a user can edit the configuration inside the environment of a specific release instance. The user also needs **Manage releases** permission to save the modified release. | Project, Release definition, Environment |
| **Manage deployments** | Can initiate a direct deployment of a release to an environment. This permission is only for direct deployments that are manually initiated by selecting the **Deploy** action in a release. If the condition on an environment is set to any type of automatic deployment, the system automatically initiates deployment without checking the permission of the user that created the release. | Project, Release definition, Environment |
| **Manage release approvers** | Can add or edit approvers for environment(s) in release definition(s). This permissions also controls whether a user can edit the approvers inside the environment of a specific release instance. | Project, Release definition, Environment |
| **Manage releases** | Can edit the configuration in releases. To edit the configuration of a specific environment in a release instance, the user also needs **Edit release environment** permission. | Project, Release definition |
| **View release definition** | Can view release definition(s). | Project, Release definition |
| **View releases** | Can view releases belonging to release definition(s). | Project, Release definition |

Default values for all of these permissions are set for team
project collections and team project groups. For example,
**Project Collection Administrators**, **Project Administrators**, and
**Release Administrators** are given all of the above permissions by
default. **Contributors** are given all permissions except
**Administer release permissions**. **Readers**, by default,
are denied all permissions except **View release definition** and
**View releases**.

<a id="task-group">  </a>

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Task group (Build and Release) permissions

You manage permissions [for task groups from the **Build and Release** hub](../build-release/set-permissions.md#task-group) of the web portal. Project, Build, and Release Administrators are granted all permissions. Task group permissions follow a hierarchical model. Defaults for all the permissions can be set at the team project
level and can be overridden on an individual task group definition.

You use task groups to encapsulate a sequence of tasks already defined in a build or a release definition into a single reusable task. You [define and manage task groups](../build-release/concepts/library/task-groups.md) in the **Task groups** tab of the **Build and Release** hub.

| Permission | Description | 
|------------|-------------| 
| **Administer task group permissions** | Can add and remove users or groups to task group security. |
| **Delete task group** | Can delete a task group. | 
| **Edit task group** | Can create, modify, or delete a task group. |

<a id="lab">  </a>

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab Management 

Visual Studio Lab Management permissions are specific to virtual machines, environments, and other resources. In addition, the creator of an object in Lab Management is automatically granted all permissions on that object.
You can set these permissions by using the [TFSLabConfig permissions command-line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfslabconfig-cmd.md#permissions).

By default, the team project level and collection-level Readers groups have only View lab resources (Read) permissions.

> [!NOTE]  
> Lab Management is deprecated for TFS 2017. We recommend that you [use Build and Release Management instead of Lab Management for automated testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/test/lab-management/use-build-or-rm-instead-of-lab-management).

##&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notifications or alerts

There are no UI permissions associated with [managing email notifications or alerts](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md). Instead, they can be managed using the [TFSSecurity command line tool](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md#collection-level-permissions).


- By default, members of the team project level **Contributors** group can subscribe to alerts for themselves.
- Members of the **Project Collection Administrators** group,
  or users who have the **Edit collection-level information**
  can set alerts in that collection for others or for a team.
- Members of the **Project Administrators** group,
  or users who have the **Edit project-level information**
  can set alerts in that team project for others or for a team.

You can manage alert permissions using [TFSSecurity](../tfs-server/command-line/tfssecurity-cmd.md).
