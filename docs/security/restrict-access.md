# Grant or restrict access to select features and functions

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You can grant or restrict access to resources that you manage in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or Team Foundation Server (TFS). Depending on your project needs, you may want to open up or close down access to a select set of features and for a select set of users. While the built-in security groups provide a standard set of permission assignments, you may need additional security requirements not met by these assignments.

If you are new to administrating permissions and groups, review [About permissions and groups](about-permissions.md) to learn about permission states and inheritance.

<!--- 
This topic should provide useful steps to think about what they want to shut down, addressing the most common areas that admins have expressed that they want to shut down or open up. Also - consider how they might structure their project - repos, area paths, etc. and how that influences permissions 

Maybe consider this in a 2 or 3 step process: 
- what areas to open up/close down
- Role and delegation 
- Impact on project structure (what tends to get out of hand over time - sprawling set of teams, queries, iteration paths, area paths, etc.

> [!TIP]    
> Because you set many permissions at an object-level, such as repositories and area paths, how you structure your team project will determine the areas you can open up or close down. 


## Recommended method for granting and restricting permissions 

For maintenance purposes, we recommend you use either the built-in security groups or [custom security groups to manage permissions](change-individual-permissions.md). 

You can't change the permission settings for the Project Administrators group or the Project Collection Administrators group. This is by design. However, for all other groups, you can change the permissions. 

If you manage a small number of users, then you may find changing individual permissions a valid option. However, custom security groups allows you to better track roles and permissions assigned to those roles.  


## Delegate tasks to specific roles

As an administrator or account owner, it's a good idea to delegate administrative tasks to those team members who lead or manage an area. Several of the main built-in roles which come with default permissions and role assignments are:
- Readers 
- Contributors 
- Stakeholders (access role)  
- Team administrator role 
- Project Administrators
- Project Collection Administrators  

For a summary of permissions provided to the above roles, see [Default permissions and access](permissions-access.md), or for the Project Collection Administrators, see [Add administrators](set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) 

To delegate tasks to other members within your organization, consider creating a custom security group and then granting permissions as indicated in the following table.

## Restrict access to view or modify objects  

VSTS and TFS are designed to enable all valid users to be able to view all objects defined in the system. You can restrict access to resources by setting the permission state to **Deny**. You can set permissions for members that belong to a custom security group or for an individual user. To learn more about how to set these types of permissions, see [Change individual permissions, grant select access to specific functions](change-individual-permissions.md). 


<table>
<tr>
<td width="25%">**Area to restrict**  
</td>
<td width="75%">**Permissions to set to Deny**
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>View or contribute to a repository</td>
<td>View, Contribute<br/>See [Set repository permissions for Git or TFVC](set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>View, create, or modify work items within an area path</td>
<td>Edit work items in this node, View work items in this node<br/>See [Set permissions and access for work tracking, Modify work items under an area path](set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>View or update select build and release definitions</td>
<td>Edit build definition, View build definition<br/>
Edit release definition, View release definition<br/>
You set these permissions at the object level. See [Set build and release permissions](../pipelines/policies/set-permissions.md).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Edit a dashboard</td>
<td>View dashboards<br/>
See [Set dashboard permissions](../report/dashboards/dashboard-permissions.md).</td>
</tr>

## Restrict modification of work items based on a user or group  

For the [Hosted XML process model](../work/customize/hosted-xml-process-model.md) and [On-premises XML process model](../work/customize/on-premises-xml-process-model.md), you can customize work item types to support these restriction requests: 
- Restrict who can create or modify a work item 
- Restrict who can create specific work item types, such as Epics or Features 

You achieve this by adding a rule to the work item type, usually within the **WORKFLOW** section. To learn more, see [Add a rule to a work item type, Apply or ignore rules based on user or group](../work/customize/reference/apply-rule-work-item-field.md#apply-or-ignore-rules-based-on-user-or-group). 

> [!NOTE]   
> These restriction types aren't available for VSTS accounts and the [Inheritance process model](../work/customize/inheritance-process-model.md). 

<!---STEPS TO CONSIDER
What do you want to restrict access to? Look up the permission associated with that feature - you can use the Reverse Lookup to determine if it is at the object-level, project-level, or collection-level. 
Who do you want to restrict access?  Is it one or two folks, or a large number of users. 
Create a custom security group 
Add users to that group 
Set the permissions to restrict access to a feature. 

Should we have a Concepts topic about restricting -- address things that we support/don't support. 

User Voice requests: 
* Hide Work Item Types (WITs) based on permission/security group

If you have requirements where you want to restrict user views or select users ability to contribute within an area, you may want to create a separate team project where you restrict access. 

What you can do on TFS differs from what is available  from VSTS
