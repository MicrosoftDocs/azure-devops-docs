# Set up Active Directory or Azure Active Directory

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

The method we recommend for managing a large set of user accounts is to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Active Directory (AD) for Team Foundation Server (TFS). By managing your user base using AD/Azure AD, you simplify the maintenance of managing permissions across your organization.

If you only have to manage a small set of users, then you can skip this step. However, if you foresee that your organization may grow, you may want to set up AD or Azure AD. Also, if you plan on paying for extra services, you'll need to set up Azure AD for use with VSTS or TFS to support billing.

> * Set up Active Directory for use with TFS

> [!NOTE]
> Without Azure AD, all VSTS users must sign in using Microsoft accounts, and you must manage account access by individual user accounts. Even if you manage account access using Microsoft accounts, you need to set up an [Azure subscription in order to manage billing](../billing/set-up-billing-for-your-account-vs.md).

## Set up Azure Active Directory for use with VSTS or TFS

* [Access VSTS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](../accounts/access-with-azure-ad.md)

## Manage organizational access with Azure AD

* [Add VSTS users to your Azure AD](../accounts/add-users-to-aad.md)
* [Connect VSTS account to Azure AD](../accounts/connect-account-to-aad.md)
* [Disconnect VSTS account from Azure AD](../accounts/disconnect-account-from-aad.md)
* [Delete users from VSTS connected to Azure AD](../accounts/delete-users-from-services-aad.md)

## Set up Active Directory for use with TFS

Use these resources to learn about installing Active Directory. Typically, you should install Active Directory prior to installing TFS.

* [Install Active Directory Domain Services (Level 100)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/deploy/install-active-directory-domain-services--level-100-)
* [Step-By-Step: Setting up Active Directory in Windows Server 2016](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/canitpro/2017/02/22/step-by-step-setting-up-active-directory-in-windows-server-2016/)
