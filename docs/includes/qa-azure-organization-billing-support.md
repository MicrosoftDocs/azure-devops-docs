### Where can I check my bill or update billing details on my Azure subscription?

If you're the Azure Account Administrator, 
[view your subscription at the Azure account portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### What if I have other questions about Azure subscriptions and billing?

Check the [Azure Billing and Subscription FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-subscription-faq/), 
or try [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).

### Why can't I link more organizations to my Azure subscription? What does the error "The resource is blocked to receive any update" mean?

You can link up to 25 organizations to your Azure subscription. After you add 25 organizations, Azure stops you from adding more organizations.
