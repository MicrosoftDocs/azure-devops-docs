> This article applies to project customization for Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models. Many features you can customize in a process template for on-premises Azure DevOps aren't supported for Azure DevOps Services, which is based on the [Inheritance process model](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model). For an overview of process models, see [Customize your work tracking experience](/azure/devops/reference/customize-work).
