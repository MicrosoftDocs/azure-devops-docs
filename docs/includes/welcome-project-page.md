> [!NOTE]   
> Your first project was created by using a Git repository and the [Agile process](../boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md). If you want a project that uses the Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) repository or the Scrum or CMMI process, see [Choose a process](../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md) for a comparison of processes. Then, you can choose a process by [adding another project](../organizations/projects/create-project.md). 

Select one of the following tasks to get started:  
- **Boards** to begin [adding work items](../boards/work-items/view-add-work-items.md).
- **Repos** to open the [Repos > Files](../repos/git/clone.md) page. There, you can clone or import a repository or [initialize a README file](../organizations/projects/project-vision-status.md) for your project summary page.
- **Pipelines** to start [defining a pipeline](../pipelines/index.yml).
- **Test Plans** to start [defining test plans and test suites](../test/create-a-test-plan.md).
- [Manage your services](/azure/devops/settings/set-services) to disable the visibility of one or more services.

To get started managing your project, see [Get started as an administrator](../user-guide/project-admin-tutorial.md).
