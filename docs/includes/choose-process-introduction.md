Anytime you create a project, you must choose a process or process template based on the process model selected for your organization or collection. When choosing a process for your project, it's important to understand the following terms: 

- A *process model* refers to the model used to support projects created for an organization (Azure DevOps Services) or project collection (Azure DevOps Server). Only one process model is supported for a project at a time. A comparison of the three process models&mdash;Inheritance, On-premises XML, and Hosted XML&mdash;is provided in [Customize work tracking](../reference/customize-work.md#collection-level-process-customization).  
- A *process* defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and supports the Inheritance process model for Azure Boards. This model supports customization of projects through a WYSIWYG user interface. 
- A *process template* defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and other subsystems you access through Azure DevOps. Process templates are only used with the Hosted XML and On-premises XML process models. You customize projects by modifying and importing process template XML definition files.
