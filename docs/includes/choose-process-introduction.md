When you create a project, you choose a *process* or *process template* based on the *process model* for which your organization or collection was created. Before you choose a process for your project, understand the following terms: 

|Term  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Process model | Refers to the model used to support projects created for an organization or project collection. Only one process model is supported for a project at a time.         |
|Process     | Defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and supports the *Inheritance* process model for Azure Boards. This model supports customization of projects through a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) user interface.        |
|Process template     | Defines the building blocks of the work item tracking system and other subsystems you access through Azure DevOps. Process templates are only used with the *Hosted XML* and *On-premises XML* process models. You can customize projects by modifying and importing process template XML definition files.        |
