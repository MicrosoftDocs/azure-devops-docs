## Add users to your project 

You add users to a team or project so they can contribute to the team and project. Users can be added to multiple teams and projects. 

Users that have been added to an organization, can easily be added to a project by adding them to a team or inviting them to contribute to a project.  

Team administrators can add users to their team which automatically adds them to the project. By adding users to a team, you make team-specific tools aware of them, such as the team security group, Team Members widget, and sprint capacity planning tools. To learn more about teams, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

Members of the **Project Administrators** group can add users to a project.  Adding users to a team or project automatically adds them to the project's **Contributors** group. Members of this group have permissions to most features needed to contribute to work items, code, builds, and releases. For an overview of default permissions, see [Default permissions quick reference](../../organizations/security/permissions-access.md).

 Once users have been added to a project or organization, you can browse for their display name or user name (email alias) from any people-picker tool. Users can connect to a project and access features available through a supported client or the web portal.
