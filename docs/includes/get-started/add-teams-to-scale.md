## Add teams to scale your project

As your organization grows, we recommend that you add teams to scale your project. Each team gets [access to their own set of customizable Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

![Agile tools and team assets](../../organizations/settings/media/agile-tools/agile-tools-team-assets-post-2018.png)

To learn more, see the following articles:

- [About projects and scaling your organization](../../organizations/projects/about-projects.md)
- [Add a team, move from one default team to several teams](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md)  
- [Add a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md)
