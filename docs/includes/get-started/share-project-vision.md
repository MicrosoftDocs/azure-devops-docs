## Share your project vision, set up a project wiki 


::: moniker range="azure-devops"  

Each project has a summary page that's useful for sharing information through **README** files. Or, redirect users to a project Wiki. For users who are new to your project, we recommend that you [set up your project summary page](../../organizations/projects/project-vision-status.md). Or, you can [provision a Wiki](../../project/wiki/wiki-create-repo.md). Use these features to share established processes and procedures for your project.
