## Remove unused services 

To simplify the web portal user interface, you can disable select services. For example, if you use a project only to log bugs, then disable all services except for **Boards**. To learn more, see [Turn a service on or off](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md).  

This example shows that **Test Plans** is disabled:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Disable a service](../../user-guide/media/services/set-service-visibility.png)
