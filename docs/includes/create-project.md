## Create a project

If you signed up for Azure DevOps with a newly created Microsoft account (MSA), your project is automatically created and named based on your sign-in.

If you signed up for Azure DevOps with an existing MSA or GitHub identity, you're automatically prompted to create a project. You can create either a public or private project. To learn more about public projects, see [What is a public project?](../organizations/projects/about-projects.md). 

1. Enter information into the form provided, which includes a project name, description, visibility selection, initial source control type, and work item process.

   For more information, see [Choose the right version control for your project](../repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc.md) and [About processes and process templates](../boards/work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).  

2. When your project is complete, the welcome page appears.
