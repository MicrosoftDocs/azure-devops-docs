## Portfolio backlog 
An interactive list of work items, similar to the product backlog, that supports organizing or grouping work under features, epics, or scenarios. Portfolio backlogs work similarly to product backlogs in that you can prioritize work and view the tree hierarchy of work. Learn more: [Define features and epics](../../boards/backlogs/define-features-epics.md).
