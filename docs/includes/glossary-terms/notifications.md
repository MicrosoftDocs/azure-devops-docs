## Notifications
With notifications, you receive an email when changes occur to work items, code reviews, pull requests, source control files, and builds. For example, you can get notified whenever a bug that you opened is resolved, or when a work item is assigned to you. You receive notifications based on rules or subscriptions made by you, for your teams, or for the project. Learn more: [About notifications](../../notifications/about-notifications.md).
