## Public projects	

A project created within an Azure DevOps Services organization that is visible to the whole world. Everyone in the world can discover them and perform limited operations. You can use the [Azure DevOps CLI to discover a list of projects](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md#list-and-connect-to-projects). Administrators can control who gets to fully contribute. Administrators can switch a project from private to public, and vice-versa, as described in [Change the project visibility](../../organizations/public/make-project-public.md).
