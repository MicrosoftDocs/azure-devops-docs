## Plans (also known as delivery plans) 
 
A plan is a configurable view that displays work from multiple teams and projects laid out within a calendar based on each team's iterations. Each row in the view represents the work from a team's product or portfolio backlog. Each card corresponds to a work item, such as user story, feature, or epic. To learn more, see [Review team delivery plans](../../boards/plans/review-team-plans.md).
