## Discussion 

Area within a work item form that supports adding and reviewing comments made about the work being performed. This way, you capture all comments within the work item rather than maintaining a long email thread. Within the discussion section, you can use the [<strong>@mention</strong> control](/azure/devops/notifications/at-mentions) to notify another team member about the discussion. Simply type **@** and their name.
