## Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)

A centralized version control system. With TFVC, devs have only one version of each file on their dev machines. Branches are path-based and created on the server. Historical data is maintained only on the server. Learn more: [Use Team Foundation Version Control](/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/overview).
