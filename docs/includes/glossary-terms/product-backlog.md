## Product backlog 
An interactive list of work items that corresponds to a team's project plan or roadmap for what the team plans to deliver. The product backlog supports prioritizing work, forecasting work by sprints, and quickly linking work to portfolio backlog items. You can define your backlog items and then manage their status using the Kanban board. 

Each product backlog can be customized by a team. Learn more: [Create your backlog](../../boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).
