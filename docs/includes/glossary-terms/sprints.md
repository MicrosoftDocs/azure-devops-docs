## Sprints (also known as iterations) 
A sprint is a time period of usually two to three weeks that's used to group work items to be completed during that time period. Sprints are used in Scrum methods to support sprint planning, sprint burndown, and other Scrum processes. Sprints are defined via iteration paths. To learn more, see [About area and iteration paths (aka sprints)](../../organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations.md).
