### Q: Why can't I sign in after I select "personal Microsoft account" or "work or school account"?

A: When your sign-in address is shared by your personal Microsoft account and by your work account or school account, but your selected identity doesn't have access, you can't sign in. Although both identities use the same sign-in address, they're separate: they have different profiles, security settings, and permissions.

Sign out completely from Azure DevOps by completing the following steps. Closing your browser might not sign you out completely. Sign in again and select your other identity:

1. Close all browsers, including browsers that aren't running Azure DevOps.

2. Open a private or incognito browsing session. 

3. Go to this URL: `https://aka.ms/vssignout`.

   You see a message that says, "Sign out in progress." After you sign out, you're redirected to the Azure DevOps @dev.azure.microsoft.com webpage.

   > [!TIP]
   > If the sign-out page takes more than a minute to sign you out, close the browser and continue.

4. Sign in to Azure DevOps again. Select your other identity.
