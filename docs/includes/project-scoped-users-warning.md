> [!WARNING]  
> When the **Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects** preview feature is enabled for the organization, project-scoped users are unable to search for users who were added to the organization through Azure Active Directory group membership, rather than through an explicit user invitation. This is an unexpected behavior and a resolution is being worked on. To self-resolve this issue, disable the **Limit user visibility and collaboration to specific projects** preview feature for the organization.
