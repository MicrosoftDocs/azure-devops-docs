### Why do I need to choose between a "work or school account" and a "personal account"?

Choose a "work or school account" or a "personal account" when you sign in by using an email address (for example, jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com) that both accounts share. Although both identities use the same sign-in address, they're separate and have different profiles, security settings, and permissions.
