### Why do I have to choose between a "work or school account" and my "personal account"?

You have to choose between a "work or school account" and your "personal account" when you sign in with an email address (for example, jamalhartnett@fabrikam.com) shared by both accounts. Although both identities use the same sign-in address, they're separate and have different profiles, security settings, and permissions.
