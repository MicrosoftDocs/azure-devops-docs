# Set up Cloud Solution Provider customer and billing in Partner Center

**VSTS**

Partners in the [Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/cloud-solution-provider) program
can purchase Visual Studio cloud services for their customers
via the [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com).

Get started:

* Partners need to have the appropriate permissions role to purchase in the Partner Center. [Learn more](https://msdn.microsoft.com/partner-center/create-user-accounts-and-set-permissions) about roles in Partner Center.
* Set up a customer tenant and CSP-based Azure subscription in Partner Center by following these steps:

## Customer set up steps from video

1. Sign in to your [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com) account. 
2. On the Dashboard, choose **Add new customer**, or add a new customer from the **Customers** page. Provide the customer's details and advance to the customer's subscriptions.
3. Add an Azure subscription, which the marketplace uses for billing. Customers can have as many Azure subscriptions as needed. Choose **Add subscription** and then **Microsoft Azure** to add more.
4. Review your order and **Submit**.

New subscriptions will initially have the subscription name "Microsoft Azure", so be sure to give subscriptions
appropriate nicknames. Simply choose the subscription name, enter a new subscription nickname, and submit.

Now you're ready to buy Visual Studio. To purchase Visual Studio for a customer, choose the appropriate customer and
then choose **service management**.  If you haven't added an Azure subscription for the customer, the **Visual Studio
Marketplace** and **Manage Visual Studio Subscriptions** links won't appear.

The Visual Studio Marketplace is where you go to purchase Visual Studio cloud subscriptions and VSTS resources for your
customers.  Choose **Manage Visual Studio Subscriptions** to assign subscriptions you've already purchased for your
customer's end user.  You can also delete existing assigned subscriptions or reassign them to a different user.

## View Visual Studio pricing for CSP partners

To view Visual Studio pricing for CSP partners, log into the [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com).  Choose
**Pricing and offers** from the left nav.  Choose the current month pricing file under **usage-based services** in
the upper right. Once the Excel spreadsheet downloads, go to the **Azure Price List** sheet, and
filter the **Meter Category** column to **Visual Studio**.

> [!NOTE]
> Partners purchase Visual Studio in the CSP program through the Partner Center. At this time, there is no API
> for automation.
