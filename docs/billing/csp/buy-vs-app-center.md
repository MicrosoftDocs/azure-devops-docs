# Buy Visual Studio App Center resources

Partners in the CSP program can enable their customers to purchase [App Center resources](http://www.visualstudio.com/app-center/),
including build pipelines, test device concurrencies, and advanced push notifications, using a CSP-based Azure subscription.

To enable the customer to purchase App Center resources using a CSP-based Azure subscription, confirm the following:

* The customer has **Org Admin** rights in App Center, granting them access to the **Billing** tab.

* The customer has **Owner** role permissions to the CSP-based Azure subscription in order to make purchases. [Learn more about adding users with co-owner permissions] (/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-or-change-co-administrator).
