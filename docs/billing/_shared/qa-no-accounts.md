####Q:		Why don't I see my VSTS account in the Visual Studio Marketplace?

A:	If you don't see your account when buying from the Visual Studio Marketplace, 
try these steps:

0.	Check the identity that you use to sign in to the Visual Studio Marketplace. 
In the top right corner of the page, click your user name to view your profile. 
0.	On the left side, make sure that your email address and directory are correct.
0.	Close all browser windows.
0.	Open a private or incognito browsing session.
0.	Sign in to the Visual Studio Marketplace with the identity 
that's a user in the VSTS account that you want.

	> [!TIP]
	> If you're asked to choose "work or school account" or 
	> "personal account", this means you used an email address 
	> that's the same for a Microsoft account and a "work or school account" 
	> that's managed by your organization in Azure Active Directory. 
	> Although these identities have the same email address, 
	> they're still separate identities with different profiles, 
	> security settings, and permissions.
	> 
	> Choose the identity that's the user in 
	> the VSTS account that you want to select.
