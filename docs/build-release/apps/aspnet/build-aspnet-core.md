# Build your ASP.NET Core app

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.3**

Follow these steps to set up a continuous integration (CI) process for an ASP.NET Core app using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or Team Foundation Server (TFS).

As you walk through this quickstart, we'll ask you to choose:

* Which kind of Git service you're using: VSTS or TFS, or GitHub.

* How you want to define your build: in a web interface, or configured as code in YAML

* For continuous deployment, what is your target: Azure web app or IIS server in a Windows VM, a Linux VM, or a Docker container.

As you choose from these options in the sections below, this topic will adapt to your choices.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-cd-prerequisites-vsts.md)]

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-cd-prerequisites-tfs.md)]

## Get the sample code

The sample app we use here is a Visual Studio solution that has two projects: An ASP.NET Core Web Application project and a Unit Test project (both targeting .NET Core 2.0 framework). This quickstart works for any apps that target the .NET Core 1.1 or 2.0 frameworks.

```

Where do you want to keep your code? Whichever service you choose, our system can automatically clone and pull code from it every time you push a change.

## Web or config as code

Do you want to define your build process in your web browser or configure it as code in YAML?

# [Web](#tab/web)

Choose this option if you prefer a graphical interface in your web browser.

![PowerShell script task says "Hello World"](../../_shared/_img/powershell-script-hello-world.png)

# [YAML](#tab/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

Choose this option if you want the advantages of configuration as code. This means your definition is versioned with your code and follows the same branching structure as your code. 

```YAML
steps:
- script: echo hello world 
```

This choice also offers parallel processing (fan out and fan in), and the ability to test and debug the process locally.

## Create the CI process definition

[!INCLUDE [include](../../_shared/ci-quickstart-intro.md)]

[//]: # (TODO: Restore use of includes when we get support for using them in a list.)

Begin by creating your build definition.

# [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/gitvsts/web)

1. Navigate to the **Files** tab of the **Code** hub, and then choose **Set up build**.

 ![Screenshot showing button to set up build for a repository](../_shared/_img/set-up-first-build-from-code-hub.png)

 You are taken to the **Build and Release** hub and asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

1. In the right panel, select **ASP.NET Core**, and then choose **Apply**.

 ![Screenshot showing dotnet core template](_shared/_img/apply-aspnet-core-build-template.png)

# [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/gitvsts/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

To create a definition that is configured as code, you'll modify a YAML file in the repo root that has a well-known name: **.vsts-ci.yml**. The first time you change this file, VSTS automatically uses it to create your build definition.

1. Navigate to the **Code** hub, choose the **Files** tab, and then choose the repository you created in the above steps.

1. Choose the **.vsts-ci.yml** file, and then choose **Edit**.

1. Replace the contents of the file with code from the next section.

# [GitHub repo](#tab/github/web)

::: moniker range="vsts"

In VSTS:

1. Navigate to the **Builds** tab of the **Build and Release** hub in VSTS or TFS, and then choose **+ New**. You're asked to **Select a template** for the new build definition.

1. In the right panel, select **ASP.NET Core**, and then choose **Apply**.

To create a definition that is configured as code, you'll modify a YAML file in the repo root that has a well-known name: **.vsts-ci.yml**. You'll then create a build definition that points to the YAML file.

In GitHub:

1. Edit the **.vsts-ci.yml** file in the root of your repo, and replace the contents of the file with code from the next section.

## Choose your deployment target

While a CI build process is a powerful way to do day-to-day development, continuous deployment is how many teams accelerate how they deliver value to customers. After each successful CI build, you can automatically deploy your app. 

To get ready for continuous deployment, choose which kind of deployment target you want, and then adjust your CI process as needed.

# [Azure web app or IIS server](#tab/deploy-windows/web)

All the tasks you need were automatically added to the build definition by the template. These are the steps that will automatically run every time you push code changes. Proceed to finish the CI process definition.

# [Linux VM](#tab/deploy-linux/web)

To prepare your CI build to deploy to a Linux VM:

1. Select **Tasks**.

1. Select the **.NET Core** publish task, and then clear the **Zip published projects** checkbox.
  
> **Why do this?** 
By default, the build template creates a .ZIP file for deploying to an Azure Web App or a Windows VM.
This change causes the build to publish a set of uncompressed files and folders suitable for deployment to a Linux VM running the nginx web server.

## Finish the CI process definition

You're nearly ready to go. Just a few more steps to complete your CI build process.

# [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/gitvsts/web)

1. For the **Agent queue**:

 * **VSTS:** Select _Hosted Linux_. This is how you can use our pool of agents that have the software you need to build your app.

 * **TFS:** Select a queue that includes a [Linux build agent](../../actions/agents/v2-linux.md) on a machine that has Docker and is configured to run containers.

1. Select **Get sources** and then:

 Observe that the new build definition is automatically linked to your repository.

1. Select the **Triggers** tab in the build definition. Enable the **Continuous Integration** trigger. This will ensure that the build process is automatically triggered every time you commit a change to your repository.

1. Choose **Save & queue** to kick off your first build. On the **Save build definition and queue** dialog box, choose **Save & queue**.

1. A new build is started. You'll see a link to the new build on the top of the page. Choose the link to watch the new build as it happens.

# [VSTS or TFS repo](#tab/gitvsts/yaml)

::: moniker range="vsts"

1. Navigate to the **Build and Release** hub.

1. Observe that there's a new build definition named _{name-of-your-repo} YAML CI_. A build is queued; its status could be either not started or running. Choose the number of the build: _{year}{month}{day}.1_.

1. In the left column of the running build, select **Job**. After an agent is assigned to your job and the agent is initialized, then you'll see information about the build in the console.

For this example, to learn some of the basics, you changed the YAML file to use the  `dotNetCoreCLI` task instead of calling the `dotnet` command directly in a script. The changes you made affect how the build output is organized. Each step is shown and can be inspected in the build summary, instead of all the output combined in one log from a single script.

The changes you made also modified what the build does. For example, the `dotnet restore` command you replaced creates .DLL files, but it doesn't create a web deployment file. After you've completed the above steps, your build instead uses the `dotNetCoreCLI` task, which in addition to creating the .DLL file, also creates a web deployment package (a .ZIP file) that is more efficient to deploy.

1. Select **Get sources** and then:

 Select your version control repository. You'll need to authorize access to your repo.

1. Select the **Triggers** tab in the build definition. Enable the **Continuous Integration** trigger. This will ensure that the build process is automatically triggered every time you commit a change to your repository.
