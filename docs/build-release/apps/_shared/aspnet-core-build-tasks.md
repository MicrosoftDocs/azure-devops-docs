After you select the **ASP.NET Core (PREVIEW)** template, instances of the .NET Core task are added to your build definition to [restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/dotnet-restore), [build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/dotnet-build), [test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/dotnet-test), and [publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/dotnet-publish) the app.
