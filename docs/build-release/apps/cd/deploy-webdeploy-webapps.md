# Deploy a web app to Azure App Services

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.2**

We'll show you how to set up continuous deployment of your ASP.NET or Node app to an Azure web app using
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS). You can use the steps in this quickstart
as long as your continuous integration process publishes a Web Deploy package.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need a CI build that publishes your Web Deploy package. To set up CI for your specific type of app, see:

* [Build your ASP.NET 4 app](../aspnet/build-aspnet-4.md)

* [Build your ASP.NET Core app](../aspnet/build-aspnet-core.md)

* [Build your Node app with Gulp](../nodejs/build-gulp.md)

You'll also need an Azure web app where you will deploy the app.
If you don't have one already, create one now. If you need help, follow the
steps in [this example](../../apps/cd/azure/aspnet-core-to-azure-webapp.md#create-webapp-portal).

[!INCLUDE [create-release](../_shared/create-release.md)]

## Next steps

* [Deploy to a staging slot and then swap to production](howto-webdeploy-webapps.md#swapslots)
* [Deploy multiple apps in the same release](howto-webdeploy-webapps.md#multipleapps)
* [Apply environment-specific configurations](howto-webdeploy-webapps.md#configenvir)
* [Deploy to a Government cloud or Azure Stack instead of a public cloud](howto-webdeploy-webapps.md#govtcloud)
