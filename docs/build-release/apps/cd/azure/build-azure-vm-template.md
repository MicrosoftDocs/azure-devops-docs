# Build an Azure virtual machine using an Azure RM template

[!INCLUDE [version-rm-dev14](../../../_shared/version-rm-dev14.md)]

In just a few steps, you can provision Azure virtual machines (VMs)
using [Resource Manager (RM) templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-template-deploy/).
Managing the definitions for virtual machines in this
way is considered **Infrastructure as code** and is
a good DevOps practice.

For this example, the template for creating the Azure
VMs must be checked into a version control repository
along with the rest of the application code, and it
must be published as part of the build output.

## Get set up

Before you can build the solution, you must create an
Azure RM template.

### Create the template 

Follow these steps to create and check-in a new Resource Manager template.

1. In Visual Studio, choose **File | Add | New project** and add a
   new **Azure Resource Group** project to your solution.

1. When prompted for an Azure template, select **Windows Virtual Machine**.

   >The **Windows Virtual Machine** template is a simple example of
   provisioning a single virtual machine in Azure.
   For provisioning other types of resources, you can either edit the
   **WindowsVirtualMachine.json** file, select other
   templates in the project creation wizard, or download one
   of the many templates available at
   [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates).

1. Add a project for your app to the solution. This could be
   a project for an existing app, or a new project created from the
   Visual Studio **File | Add | New project** menu.

1. Save the entire solution (not just the project) and 
   commit the changes into a [Team Foundation Server](../../../../tfvc/index.md) or 
   [VSTS Git](../../../../git/index.md) repository.

### Create the build definition

Carry out the following steps to publish an artifact with the Resource Manager template files.

1. Make sure that the template files from the **HelloWorldARM**
   project are included in the artifacts published by Build. 

1. Queue a new build and verify that the artifact contains 
   the **Templates** folder containing the template files
   **WindowsVirtualMachine.json** and **WindowsVirtualMachine.parameters.json**.

### Enable continuous integration (CI)

On the Triggers tab, enable **continuous integration** (CI). This tells the system to queue a build whenever someone on your team commits or checks in new code.

## Queue and test the build

Save the build definition and queue a new build by selecting the **Queue new build** command. Once the build is done, click **Artifacts** and then **Explore** to see the template files produced by the build. This is the template that your release definition will consume to provision an Azure virtual machine.

## Provision your virtual machine

After you've run the build, you're ready to create a release definition to provision your virtual machine:
