# Deploy to an Azure Web App for Containers

**VSTS**

We'll show you how to set up continuous deployment of your Docker-enabled app to an Azure web app using
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).

For example, you can continuously deliver your app to a Windows VM hosted in Azure.

After you commit and push a code change, it is automatically built and then deployed. The results will automatically show up on your site.

## Define your CI build process

You'll need a continuous integration (CI) build process that publishes a Docker container image.
To set up a CI build process, see:

* [Build and push a Docker image](../containers/build.md).

## Prerequisites

You'll need an Azure subscription. You can get one free through [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/).

[!INCLUDE [create-azure-webapp-to-host-container](../_shared/create-azure-webapp-to-host-container.md)]

[!INCLUDE [create-release-azure-webapp-container](../_shared/create-release-azure-webapp-container.md)]

## Next steps

* [Set up multi-stage release](../../actions/define-multistage-release-process.md)
