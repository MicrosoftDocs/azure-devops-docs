# Test: Publish Code Coverage Results

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-tfs-2015-rtm.md)]

![icon](_img/publish-code-coverage-results-icon.png)
Publishes the code coverage results generated by a build that uses a third-party tool such as 
[Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) and [Jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/).
See the vendor's documentation for more information about these tools. 

## Demands

The build agent must have the following capabilities:

* MSBuild
* Azure PowerShell

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Code Coverage Tool** | Required. The tool with which code coverage results are generated. Currently supported schemas are [Cobertura](http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/xml/coverage-04.dtd) and [Jacoco](http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/coverage/report.dtd). |
| **Summary File** | Required. The path of the summary file containing code coverage statistics such as line, method, and class coverage. The value may contain [minimatch patterns](../file-matching-patterns.md). Example: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/**/site/cobertura/coverage.xml` |
| **Report Directory** | The path of the code coverage HTML report directory. The report directory is published for subsequent viewing as an artifact of the build. The value may contain [minimatch patterns](../file-matching-patterns.md). Example: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/MyApp/**/site/cobertura` |
| **Additional Files** | The file path pattern specifying any additional code coverage files to be published as artifacts of the build. The value may contain [minimatch patterns](../file-matching-patterns.md). Example: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*.exec` |
| **Control options** | See [Control options](../../concepts/process/tasks.md#controloptions) |
