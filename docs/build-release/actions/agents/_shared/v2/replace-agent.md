 ## Replace an agent
 
 When you configure an agent using the same name as an agent that already exists, you're asked if you want to replace the existing agent. If you answer `Y`, then make sure you remove the agent (see below) that you're replacing. Otherwise after a few minutes of conflicts, one of the agents will shut down.
