# Deploy an agent on Windows

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | [TFS 2015](v1-windows.md) | [Previous versions (XAML builds)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms252495%28v=vs.120%29.aspx)**

To build and deploy Windows, Azure, and other Visual Studio solutions you'll need at least one Windows agent. Windows agents can also build Java and Android apps.

> Before you begin:
> * If your code is in [VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs) and a [hosted agent](../../concepts/agents/hosted.md) meets your needs, you can skip setting up a private Windows agent.
> * If your code is in an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2015 server, see [Deploy an agent on Windows for on-premises TFS 2015](v1-windows.md).
> *  Otherwise, you've come to the right place to set up an agent on Windows. Continue to the next section.

## Check prerequisites

Make sure your machine is prepared with our [Windows system prerequisites](https://aka.ms/vstsagentwinsystem).

If you're building from a Subversion repo, you must install the Subversion client on the machine.

## Download and configure the agent

<ol>
<li>Log on to the machine using the account for which you've prepared permissions as explained above.</li>
<li>In your web browser, sign on to VSTS or TFS, and navigate to the **Agent pools** tab:
[!INCLUDE [include](../../concepts/agents/_shared/agent-pools-tab.md)]
</li>

<li>Click **Download agent**.</li>

<li>On the **Get agent** dialog box, click **Windows**.</li>

<li>Click the **Download** button.

<li>Follow the instructions on the page.</li>
</ol>

> [!IMPORTANT]

> Make sure your server is [configured to support the authentication method](configure-tfs-authentication.md) you want to use. 
  
When you configure your agent to connect to TFS, you've got the following options:

* **Alternate** Connect to TFS using Basic authentication. After you select Alternate you'll be prompted for your credentials.

* **Negotiate** Connect to TFS as a user other than the signed-in user via a Windows authentication scheme such as NTLM or Kerberos. After you select Negotiate you'll be prompted for credentials.

* **Integrated** (Default) Connect a Windows agent to TFS using the credentials of the signed-in user via a Windows authentication scheme such as NTLM or Kerberos. You won't be prompted for credentials after you choose this method.
 
* **PAT** Supported only on VSTS and TFS 2017 and newer. After you choose PAT, paste the [PAT token you created](#permissions) into the command prompt window.

> [!NOTE]
> When using PAT as the authentication method, the PAT token is used only for the initial configuration of the agent. Learn more at [Communication with VSTS or TFS](../../concepts/agents/agents.md#communication).

## Choose interactive or service mode

For guidance on whether to run the agent in interactive mode or as a service, see [Agents: Interactive vs. service](../../concepts/agents/agents.md#account).

 If you configured the agent to run interactively, to run it:

 ```ps
 .\run.cmd
 ```

If you configured the agent to run as a service, it starts automatically. You can view and control the agent running status from the services snap-in. Run `services.msc` and look for "VSTS Agent (*name of your agent*)".

If you need to change the logon account, don't do it from the services snap-in. Instead, see the information below to re-configure the agent.

[!INCLUDE [include](_shared/v2/replace-agent.md)]

## Remove and re-configure an agent

To remove the agent:

```ps
.\config remove
```

After you've removed the agent, you can [configure it again](#download-configure).

## Help on other options

To learn about other options:

```ps
.\config --help
```

The help provides information on authentication alternatives and unattended configuration.
