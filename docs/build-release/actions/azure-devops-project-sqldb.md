# Tutorial:  Deploy your ASP.NET App and Azure SQL Database with the Azure DevOps Project

The Azure DevOps Project presents a simplified experience where you bring your existing code and Git repository, or choose from one of the sample applications to create a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline to Azure.  The DevOps project automatically creates Azure resources such as an Azure SQL Database, creates and configures a release pipeline in VSTS that includes a build definition for CI, sets up a release definition for CD, and then creates an Azure Application Insights resource for monitoring.

You will:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure DevOps project for an ASP.NET App and Azure SQL Database
> * Configure VSTS and an Azure subscription

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. You can get one free through [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/).

## Create an Azure DevOps project for an ASP.NET App and Azure SQL Database

The Azure DevOps Project creates a CI/CD pipeline in VSTS.  You can create a **new VSTS** account or use an **existing account**.  The Azure DevOps Project also creates **Azure resources** such as an Azure SQL Database in the **Azure subscription** of your choice.

1. Sign into the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Choose the **+ New** icon in the left navigation bar, then search for **DevOps project**.  Choose **Create**.

1. Select **.NET**, and then choose **Next**.

1. For **Choose an application Framework**, select **ASP.NET**.

1. Select **Add a database**, then choose **Next**.  

1. The application framework, which you chose on the previous steps, dictates the type of Azure service deployment target available here.  Select **Next**.

## Configure VSTS and an Azure subscription

1. Create a **new** VSTS account or choose an **existing** account.  Choose a **name** for your VSTS project.  

1. Select your **Azure subscription**.

1. Select the **Change** link to see additional Azure configuration settings, and identify the **username** in the **Database Server Login Details** section.  **Store** the **username** for future steps in this tutorial.
 
1. Exit the Azure configuration area, and choose **Done**.

1. It will take several minutes for the Azure virtual machine to be ready.  A sample ASP.NET application and SQL Server Database Project is set up in a repository in your VSTS account, an Azure SQL Server Database resource is created, a build and release executes, and your application deploys to Azure.  

	Once complete, the Azure DevOps **project dashboard** loads in the Azure portal.  You can also navigate to the **Azure DevOps Project Dashboard** directly from **All resources** in the **Azure Portal**.  

	This dashboard provides visibility into your VSTS **code repository**, **VSTS CI/CD pipeline**, **Azure SQL Database**, and deploys any code changes to your repository.  You can further configure additional options in VSTS.  On the right side of the dashboard, select **Browse** to view your running application.

## Configure the Azure SQL Server Database

The Azure DevOps project dashboard provides a direct link to the management page for the Azure SQL Database resource.  You can configure additional settings for the database, retrieve connection string information, and perform various other database management related tasks.  You also manage the **SQL Server** that hosts the **SQL Database** by performing various actions such as resetting the server login password.

1. From the Azure DevOps Project dashboard, select the **SQL Database** to navigate to the management page for the SQL DB.
   
1. Select **Set server firewall**, and then select **+ Add client IP**.  

1. Select **Save**.  You're client IP is now allowed access to the **SQL Server Azure resource**.

1. Navigate back to the **SQL Database** blade. 

1. On the right side of the screen, select the **Server name** to navigate to the configuration page for the **SQL Server**.

1. Select **Reset password**, enter a password for the **SQL Server admin login**, and then select **Save**.  **Keep** this password for future steps in this tutorial.

1. You may now optionally use client tools such as **SQL Server Management Studio** or **Visual Studio** to connect to the Azure SQL Server and Database.
	
## Examine the VSTS CI Build definition

The Azure DevOps Project automatically configures a full VSTS CI/CD pipeline in your VSTS account.  You can explore and customize the pipeline.  Follow the steps below to familiarize yourself with the VSTS build definition.

1. Navigate to the **Azure DevOps Project dashboard**.

1. Select **Build Pipelines** from the **top** of the **Azure DevOps project dashboard**.  This link opens a browser tab and opens the VSTS build definition for your new project.

1. Move the mouse cursor to the right of the build definition next to the **Status** field. Select the **ellipsis** that appears.  This action opens a menu where you can perform several activities such as **queue a new build**, **pause a build**, and **edit the build definition**.

1. Select **Edit**.

1. From this view, **examine the various tasks** for your build definition.  The build performs various tasks such as fetching sources from the VSTS Git repository, restoring dependencies, and publishing outputs used for deployments.

1. At the top of the build definition, select the **build definition name**.

1. Change the **name** of your build definition to something more descriptive.  Select **Save & queue**, then select **Save**.

1. Under your build definition name, select **History**.  You see an audit trail of your recent changes for the build.  VSTS keeps track of any changes made to the build definition and allows you to compare versions.

1. Select **Triggers**.  The Azure DevOps project automatically created a CI trigger, and every commit to the repository initiates a new build.  You can optionally choose to include or exclude branches from the CI process.

1. Select **Retention**.  Based on your scenario, you can specify policies to keep or remove a certain number of builds.

## Examine the VSTS CD Release Management definition and configure the SQL password

The Azure DevOps Project automatically creates and configures the necessary steps to deploy from your VSTS account to your Azure subscription.  These steps include configuring an Azure service connection to authenticate VSTS to your Azure subscription.  The automation also creates a VSTS Release Definition, and this provides the CD to the Azure.  Follow the steps below to examine more about the VSTS Release Definition.

1. Select **Build and Release**, then choose **Releases**.  The Azure DevOps project created a VSTS release definition to manage deployments to Azure.

1. On the left-hand side of the browser, select the **ellipsis** next to your release definition, then choose **Edit**.

1. The release definition contains a **pipeline**, which defines the release process.  Under **Artifacts**, select **Drop**.  The build definition you examined in the previous steps produces the output used for the artifact. 

1. To the right-hand side of the **Drop** icon, select the **Continuous deployment trigger** **icon** (which appears as a lightning bolt.)  This release definition has an enabled CD trigger.  The trigger initiates a deployment every time there is a new build artifact available.  Optionally, you can disable the trigger, so your deployments will then require manual execution. 

1. On the left-hand side of the browser, select **Variables**. 

1. There is a single **Password** variable you need to configure.  To the right of the **Value** text box, select the **padlock** icon.  **Enter** the password you chose earlier for the **SQL Server user**, and then select **Save**.

1. On the left-hand side of the browser, select **Tasks**, and then choose your **environment**.  

1. The tasks are the activities your deployment process performs, and they are grouped in **Phases**.  There is a single phase for this release definition.  The phase contains an **Azure App Service Deploy** and **Azure SQL Database Deployment** task.

1. Select the **Execute Azure SQL** task and examine the various properties used for the SQL deployment.  Under **Deployment Package**, notice the task uses a **SQL DACPAC file**.

1. On the right-hand side of the browser, select **View releases**.  This view shows a history of releases.

1. Select the **ellipsis** next to one of your releases, and choose **Open**.  There are several menus to explore from this view such as a **release summary**, **associated work items**, and **Tests**.

1. Select **Commits**.  This view shows code commits associated with the specific deployment. You can compare releases to view the commit differences between deployments.

1. Select **Logs**.  The logs contain useful information about the deployment process.  They can be viewed both during and after deployments.

## Commit changes to VSTS and automatically deploy to Azure 

 > [!NOTE]
 > The steps below test the CI/CD pipeline with a simple text change.  You may optionally make a SQL Server Schema change to the table to test the SQL deploy process.

You're now ready to collaborate with a team on your app with a CI/CD process that automatically deploys your latest work to your web site.  Each change to the VSTS git repo initiates a build in VSTS, and a VSTS Release Management definition executes a deployment to your Azure VM.  Follow the steps below, or use other techniques to commit changes to your repository.  The code changes initiate the CI/CD process and automatically deploys your new changes to the IIS website on the Azure VM.

1. Select **Code** from the VSTS menu, and navigate to your repository.

1. Navigate to the **SampleWebApplication\Views\Home** directory, then select the **ellipsis** next to the **Index.cshtml** file, and then choose **Edit**.

1. Make a change to the file such as some text inside one of the **div tags**.  At the top right, select **Commit**.  Select **Commit** again to push your change. 

1. In a few moments, a **build initiates in VSTS**, and then a release executes to deploy the changes.  You can monitor the **build status** with the DevOps project dashboard or in the browser with your VSTS account.

1. Once the release completes, **refresh your application** in the browser to verify you see your changes.

## Configure Azure Application Insights monitoring

With Azure Application insights, you can easily monitor your application's performance and usage.  The Azure DevOps project automatically configured an Application Insights resource for your application.  You can further configure various alerts and monitoring capabilities as needed.

1. Navigate to the **Azure DevOps Project** dashboard in the **Azure portal**.  On the bottom-right of the dashboard, choose the **Application Insights** link for your app.

1. The **Application Insights** blade opens in the Azure portal.  This view contains usage, performance, and availability monitoring information for your app.

    ![Application Insights](_img/azure-devops-project-github/appinsights.png) 

1. Select **Time range**, and then choose **Last hour**.  Select **Update** to filter the results.  You now see all activity from the last 60 minutes.  Select the **x** to exit time range.

1. You can find **Alerts** and several other useful links near the top of the dashboard.  Select **Alerts**, then select **+ Add metric alert**.

1. Enter a **Name** for the alert.

1. The default alert is for a **server response time greater than 1 second**.  Select the **Metric** drop-down to examine the various alert metrics.  For example, you can configure **ASP.NET request execution time** for an ASP.NET app.  You can easily configure a variety of alerts to improve the monitoring capabilities of your app.

1. Select the check-box for **Notify via Email owners, contributors, and readers**.  Optionally, you can perform additional actions when an alert fires by executing an Azure logic app.

1. Choose **Ok** to create the alert.  In a few moments, the alert appears as active on the dashboard.  **Exit** the Alerts area, and navigate back to the **Application Insights blade**.

1. Select **Availability**, then select **+ Add test**. 

1. Enter a **Test name**, then choose **Create**.  This creates  simple ping test to verify the availability of your application.  After a few minutes, test results are available, and the Application Insights dashboard displays an availability status.

## Clean up resources

 > [!NOTE]
 > The steps below will permanently delete resources.  Only use this functionality after carefully reading the prompts.

If you are testing, you can clean up resources to avoid accruing billing charges.  When no longer needed, you can delete the Azure virtual machine and related resources created in this tutorial by using the **Delete** functionality on the Azure DevOps Project dashboard.  **Be careful**, as the delete functionality destroys the data created by the Azure DevOps Project in both Azure and VSTS, and you will not be able to retrieve it once its gone.

1. From the **Azure Portal**, navigate to the **Azure DevOps Project**.
2. On the **top right** side of the dashboard, select **Delete**.  After reading the prompt, select **Yes** to **permanently delete** the resources.
