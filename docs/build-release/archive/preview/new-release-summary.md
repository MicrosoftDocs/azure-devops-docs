# New release progress views

A new and fully redesigned user experience is available for release progress in VSTS.
To use this page, you simply need to switch it on using one of the on-screen prompts,
or from the [user profile **Previews** panel](../../../collaborate/preview-features.md#enable-features-for-your-use).

Open the new pipeline view using the link in the toolbar.

The view shows information about the release and the deployment results.
