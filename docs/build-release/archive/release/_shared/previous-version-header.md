**Visual Studio 2015 | VSTS | TFS 2015 | [Previous version](../overview-rm2013.md)**  

![horizontal-line](../_img/horizontal-line.png)

![information](../_img/info1.png)
**A newer version of Release Management is available**

Release Management features have been integrated into the **Build &amp; Release** hub in
Team Foundation Server (TFS) and VSTS.
For more information, see [Build and Release in VSTS and TFS](../../../overview.md). 

The newer web-based version is the recommended alternative 
to the server and client version described in this topic.
If you do not already have Release Management installed, 
we encourage you to use the web-based version in TFS 2015 
Update 2 and above or VSTS instead 
of the version described here.
If you are already using an earlier server and client 
version, you should be aware that no new features will
be added to these versions.
