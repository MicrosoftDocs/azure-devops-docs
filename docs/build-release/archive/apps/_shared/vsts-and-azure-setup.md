## Get ready to go

Before you begin, make sure that you are:

* A co-administrator of the Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can get one free through [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/).

* An administrator of the VSTS account. If you don't yet have a VSTS account, you can [create one for free](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137).

* Using the **New Release Definition Editor** that is currently in preview.
