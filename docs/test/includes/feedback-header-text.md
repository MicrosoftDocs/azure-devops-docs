[Stakeholders](../../organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder.md)
can respond to feedback requests for user stories and 
features generated in Azure DevOps using
a lightweight end-to-end flow based on the 
[Test &amp; Feedback extension](../perform-exploratory-tests.md).
Only users with Basic access can request feedback. Basic users
can provide feedback using the flow described in
[this topic](../provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#non-stakeholder-feedback).

* [Request feedback](../request-stakeholder-feedback.md#request)
* [Provide feedback](../provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#provide)
* [Voluntary feedback](../voluntary-stakeholder-feedback.md#voluntary)
* [Track requests](../track-stakeholder-feedback.md#track)

> [!NOTE]
> This lightweight end-to-end flow is applicable only for web apps
> and by using Azure DevOps. To get feedback for desktop apps, or for
> earlier versions of TFS, use the feedback flow described in
> [Get feedback](/previous-versions/azure/devops/project/feedback/get-feedback)
> about the Microsoft Feedback Client.
