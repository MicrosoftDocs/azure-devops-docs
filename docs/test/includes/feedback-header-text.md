Stakeholders can respond to feedback requests in Azure DevOps by using the Test & Feedback extension, [Exploratory testing](../perform-exploratory-tests.md).

Users with Basic access can request feedback from stakeholders by using the work-item shortcut menu. If you have Basic access and want to provide feedback, follow the non‑stakeholder workflow described in [Provide stakeholder feedback](../provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#non-stakeholder-feedback).

Quick links
- [Request feedback](../request-stakeholder-feedback.md)
- [Provide feedback](../provide-stakeholder-feedback.md)
- [Voluntary feedback](../voluntary-stakeholder-feedback.md)
- [Track requests](../track-stakeholder-feedback.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The end-to-end flow described here applies to web apps and to Azure DevOps. To collect feedback for desktop apps or for older versions, use the [Get feedback](/previous-versions/azure/devops/project/feedback/get-feedback) workflow.
