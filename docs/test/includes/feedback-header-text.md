features generated in Azure DevOps or TFS using
a lightweight end-to-end flow based on the

Only users with Basic access can request feedback. Basic users
can provide feedback using the flow described in
[this topic](../provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#non-stakeholder-feedback).

> and by using Azure DevOps or TFS 2017. To get feedback for desktop apps, or for
> earlier versions of TFS, use the feedback flow described in
