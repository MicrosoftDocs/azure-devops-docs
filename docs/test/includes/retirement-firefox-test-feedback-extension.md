> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Azure DevOps Test & Feedback Extension for Firefox retirement**
> 
> The Test & Feedback Extension for Firefox will be retired on **November 30, 2026**. After this date, it will be removed from the Firefox Add-ons Marketplace and will no longer be available or supported.
>
> **Action required:** We strongly recommend switching to the actively developed and fully supported Test & Feedback Extensions for Microsoft Edge or Chrome as soon as possible. Both alternatives offer feature parity and a reliable experience, to avoid workflow disruption.
>
> **Impact if you don't migrate:** The Firefox extension will be removed and will no longer function after the retirement date. Users who don't migrate lose access to Test & Feedback capabilities via Firefox. No data loss is expected, but workflows relying on the Firefox extension are interrupted. Additionally, on the day of retirement, you might be prompted to uninstall the extension.
