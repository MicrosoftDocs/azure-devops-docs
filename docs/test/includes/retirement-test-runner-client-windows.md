> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Azure Test Plans Test Runner Client for Windows retirement**
> 
> The Test Runner Client for Windows will be retired on **November 30, 2026**. After this date, it will no longer be available or supported.
>
> **Action required:** We strongly recommend transitioning to the web-based test runner as soon as possible, which provides the same functionality with improved performance and ongoing development, to avoid workflow disruption.
>
> **Impact if you don't migrate:** Test execution workflows that rely on the Test Runner Client will be interrupted after the retirement date. No data loss is expected, but you can't execute tests through the desktop client.
