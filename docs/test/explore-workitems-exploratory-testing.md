# Explore work items with the Test &amp; Feedback extension

[!INCLUDE [version-header](_shared/version-header.md)]

Use the Test &amp; Feedback extension to explore existing work items and 
associate them with a new or an in-progress exploratory session. 
After a work item is associated with a session, all new bugs, tasks and test cases created 
in the current session are automatically linked to that work item.
This enables end-to-end traceability, and simplifies tracking
and management of issues.

You can explore:

* Work items belonging to a requirement category, a feature category, or an epic category
* Requirements-based test suites and test cases.

You can explore a work item from the [Kanban board](#kanban) or from the [extension](#extension).
You can also explore [multiple work items in the same session](#multipleitems).

## Explore work items from the Kanban board

1. In the Kanban board, open the shortcut menu of the work item
   you want to explore, and choose **Do exploratory testing**.

1. Launch the Test &amp; Feedback extension. 
   If there are acceptance criteria for the work item, these are shown.

   If you have not already started a session, start one now. 
   The work item is automatically associated with the current or new session. 

1. All bugs, tasks, and test cases you create will automatically be 
   linked to the current work item.

## Explore multiple work items in the same session

To explore another work item, you must first dissociate the current work item from the in-progress session.

1. Open the **Explore work item** page and choose **Change**.

2. Associate the new work item with the in-progress session as [described above](#extension).

## See your exploratory session results 

After you file bugs, create tasks, or create test cases, all these show up in the "Recent exploratory sessions" page in Azure Test Plans or TFS.
