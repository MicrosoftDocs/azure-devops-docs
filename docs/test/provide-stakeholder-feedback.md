## Provide feedback directly from a feedback request email

1. In the feedback request email, select **Provide feedback**. 
 
   ![Screenshot shows choosing the Provide feedback link in the request email.](media/provide-stakeholder-feedback/provide-stakeholder-feedback-04.png)

   The Azure DevOps landing page opens to confirm that the extension is automatically configured with the feedback request. 
   
2. Choose the ![launch extension](media/shared/exp-test-icon.png) icon in the toolbar to launch the extension.

   ![Screenshot shows confirmation that the extension has been automatically configured.](media/provide-stakeholder-feedback/provide-stakeholder-feedback-05.png)

   If you're a **Stakeholder**, the **Feedback requests** page is visible. 
   Read the instructions (if any) in the feedback form to understand how to give the feedback and what the requestor requires. 

   ![Screenshot shows the feedback form containing the instructions.](media/provide-stakeholder-feedback/provide-stakeholder-feedback-06.png)

   If you're a **Basic** user, the **Explore work item** traceability page shows details of the user story on which feedback was requested, and the user acceptance criteria (if any).

3. Read any instructions in the email and this page to understand how to give the feedback, and on which feature.

   You can use all the capabilities of the extension such as capturing screenshots, notes, and screen recordings. For more information, see [Exploratory testing in connected mode](connected-mode-exploratory-testing.md).
 
5. When you're done capturing feedback, do the following actions:

   * If you're a **Stakeholder**, select **Provide feedback**. You can optionally choose to create bugs and tasks when you submit your feedback. The process is the same as described in [Exploratory testing in connected mode](connected-mode-exploratory-testing.md#create-bugs).

   ![Screenshot shows submitting your feedback.](media/shared/provide-stakeholder-feedback-08.png)

   * If you're a **Basic** user, create a bug or a task. 

   ![Screenshot shows creating a bug or a task from the captured information.](media/connected-mode-exploratory-testing/create-bugs-02.png)
 
6. All your feedback shows in the response form, bug, or task. Enter a suitable title and optionally select a star rating for the feature you've been testing. 

   ![Screenshot shows entering a title and star rating.](media/shared/provide-stakeholder-feedback-09.png)

7. Save your feedback, which creates a work item in Azure DevOps containing all your feedback.
 
8. Continue to capture more feedback if necessary. You can submit multiple feedback responses, bugs, and tasks for the same feedback request. 

9. If you're a **Stakeholder**:
   
   * When you're done providing feedback, go to the **Feedback
     requests** page and choose **Feedback requests**.

     ![Screenshot shows opening the pending feedback requests page.](media/shared/provide-stakeholder-feedback-10.png)

   * In the pending feedback requests page, mark the feedback request as **Completed**.
 
     ![Screenshot shows completing your feedback session.](media/shared/provide-stakeholder-feedback-11.png)

10. **Stop** your feedback session.
