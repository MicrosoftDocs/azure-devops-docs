[Stakeholders](../../organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder.md)
can respond to feedback requests for user stories and 
features generated in Azure DevOps or TFS using
a lightweight end-to-end flow based on the 
[Test &amp; Feedback extension](../perform-exploratory-tests.md).
Only users with Basic access can request feedback. Basic users
can provide feedback using the flow described in
[this topic](../provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#non-stakeholder-feedback).

* [Request feedback](../request-stakeholder-feedback.md#request)
* [Provide feedback](../provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#provide)
* [Voluntary feedback](../voluntary-stakeholder-feedback.md#voluntary)
* [Track requests](../track-stakeholder-feedback.md#track)

>**NOTE**: This lightweight end-to-end flow is applicable only for web apps
and by using Azure DevOps or TFS 2017. To get feedback for desktop apps, or for 
earlier versions of TFS, use the feedback flow described in
[this topic](../../project/feedback/get-feedback.md)
about the Microsoft Feedback Client.
