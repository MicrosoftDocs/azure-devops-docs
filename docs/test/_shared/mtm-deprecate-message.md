We **strongly recommend** you use [Azure Test Plans](../overview.md#manual-testing-in-test-manager) in Azure DevOps or the **Test** hub in TFS (a fully featured Test management solution) over Microsoft Test Manager for all your test management requirements. **There will be no new versions of Microsoft Test Manager.** Microsoft Test Manager 2017 (which shipped with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017) is the last version.
