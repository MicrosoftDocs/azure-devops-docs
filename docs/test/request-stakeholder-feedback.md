1. Choose **Send** to generate emails to all the selected stakeholders.

> [!NOTE]
> Teams can request feedback from other team members, such as users having Basic access. 
> Just add their names in the feedback request form so that a **Request feedback** email is sent to them.
> Also see [Can users with Basic access respond to feedback requests?](provide-stakeholder-feedback.md#non-stakeholder-feedback).
