# Exploratory testing with the Test &amp; Feedback extension in Standalone mode

[!INCLUDE [version-header](_shared/version-header.md)] 

All teams can use the Test &amp; Feedback extension in **Standalone** mode. 
Users don't need an Azure DevOps subscription 
or Team Foundation Server connection to use this mode.

   issues with the app.
   
1. When you're done, stop your session.

   The extension automatically creates a session report that contains 
   details of all the bugs created during the session, and any attachments.

1. The report is saved in the default Downloads folder of your web browser. 
   Share it with the rest of your team as an email attachment, or 
   copy it to OneNote, Word, or in any other format you prefer.
