# Share steps between test cases


[!INCLUDE [version-header](includes/version-header.md)] 


When you [plan manual tests](create-a-test-plan.md) there are some sequences of steps, such as logging in, that occur in many test cases. To avoid having to enter these sequences again and again, create *shared steps*.  

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-define](includes/prerequisites-define.md)] 

[!INCLUDE [note-new-ui](includes/note-new-ui.md)] 
  
## Create shared steps 
 
While you're editing a test case, select a sequence of steps that you want to share:

The steps you selected are replaced with a link to the new shared steps work item:

## Use shared steps  

Now you can use the shared steps in another test case:

A query opens. Run it to find the steps you want to insert:

## When you run a test with shared steps  

When you [run a test](run-manual-tests.md), you can either mark the whole shared sequence as passed or failed, or mark each step separately:
