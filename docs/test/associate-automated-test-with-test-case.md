# Associate automated tests with test cases

**Visual Studio 2017 and later | [Previous version](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd380741%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)**

Consider using Visual Studio to associate automated tests with a test case when:

* You created a manual test case that you later decide is a good test
  to automate, but you still want to be able to run that test as part of a test plan.
  Tests can be run in the CI/CD pipeline by choosing the test plan or test suite
  in the settings of the [Visual Studio Test](../pipelines/tasks/test/vstest.md) task.
  Automated tests can also be run from [!INCLUDE [test-hub-include](_shared/test-hub-include.md)].
  If you are using [XAML builds](../pipelines/test/reference-qa.md#xaml-build) you can also
  [run these automated tests by using Microsoft Test Manager](mtm/run-automated-tests-with-microsoft-test-manager.md).

* You want to enable end-to-end traceability of requirements.
  If your test cases are linked to requirements or user stories,
  the results of the test execution can be used to establish the quality of those requirements. 

> **NOTE**: At present this procedure is not supported for associating MSTest V2 tests or tests written in NUnit and XUnit.
> This capability is planned for a future release. 

The process to associate an automated test with a test case is:

1. Create a test project containing your automated test.
   [What types of tests are supported?](../pipelines/test/reference-qa.md#test-types)

1. Check your test project into an Azure DevOps or Team
   Foundation Server (TFS) repository.

1. Create a build pipeline for your project, ensuring that it
   contains the automated test.
   [What are the differences if I am still using a XAML build?](../pipelines/test/reference-qa.md#xaml-build)

1. Use Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional 2017 or a later version to associate the automated
   test with a test case as shown [below](#add-test). The test case must have
   been added to a test plan that uses the build you just defined. 

If you are using the build and release services in
Azure DevOps or TFS (not a [XAML build](../pipelines/test/reference-qa.md#xaml-build)), you can run associated tests in the 
build and release pipelines by using the
[Visual Studio Test](../pipelines/tasks/test/vstest.md) task.
You _cannot_ run tests on-demand using Microsoft Test Manager unless you are using a [XAML build](../pipelines/test/reference-qa.md#xaml-build). 

The parameters in a test case are not used by any automated test that
you associate with a test case. Iterations of a test case that use these
parameters are for manual tests only.

>For more information about checking in your test project and team build, see
[Add files to the server](../repos/tfvc/add-files-server.md)
and [Continuous integration on any platform](../pipelines/overview.md).

## Associate your test  

1. Open your solution in Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional 2017 or a later version.

1. If you don't know the identifier of the work item for the test case,
   locate the test case in [!INCLUDE [test-hub-include-nolink](_shared/test-hub-include-nolink.md)], or [query for the work item](../boards/queries/using-queries.md) in the **Work** hub. 

1. When you know the identifier of the work item for the test case:

   **If you are using Visual Studio 2017 or later**, follow these steps to associate your tests.

   - If the **Test Explorer** window is not displayed, open it from the **Test | Windows** menu.

   - If your tests are not displayed in **Test Explorer**, build the solution.

   - In **Test Explorer**, select the test method you want to associate and choose **Associate to Test Case**.

   - In the dialog that opens, type the test case identifier and choose **Add Association**, then choose **Save**.

   ![Associate Automation With Test Case](_img/associate-automated-test-with-test-case/test-explorer-associate.png)

   > The dialog shows a list of test cases currently associated with the selected test method.
   You cannot associate more than one test method with a test case, but you can associate a
   test method with more than one test case.
