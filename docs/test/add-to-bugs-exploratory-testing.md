# Add findings to existing bugs with exploratory testing

[!INCLUDE [version-header](_shared/version-header.md)] 
 
To help avoid duplication, the Test &amp; Feedback extension automatically 
searches for and displays existing bugs, based on the keywords in the title,
as you file a new bug. You can choose to continue creating a new bug or add
your findings to an existing bug.

[!INCLUDE [feature-availability](_shared/feature-availability.md)] 

1. As you type the title for a new bug, in the background the extension 
   searches for similar bugs that might be related to the issue you've found
   and displays a link to the results. Choose this link to see the results that have 
   similar title keywords.

   ![The link to view similar bugs](_img/add-to-bugs-exploratory-testing/add-to-existing-bugs-01.png)
 
   The form displays **0 Similar** if it does not find any matching bugs.
   In this case, or if you don't see a "similar" link, you can create a
   new bug containing your screenshots, notes, and videos
   as described in [this topic](connected-mode-exploratory-testing.md).
 
1. If you see a bug you want to update, instead of creating a new one:

   - Select it in the list and choose **Edit**.
 
     ![Editing a similar bug](_img/add-to-bugs-exploratory-testing/add-to-existing-bugs-02.png)

   - The extension appends all your screenshots, notes, and videos to 
     the existing bug. 

   - Save the updated bug.

1. If, instead, you decide not to update an existing bug, ignore the "similar" link and:

   - Choose the **New bug** link to return to the bug details form.

     ![Returning to the bug details form](_img/add-to-bugs-exploratory-testing/add-to-existing-bugs-04.png)

   - Enter the details for the new bug and save it
     as described in [this topic](connected-mode-exploratory-testing.md).<p />
   
1. Continue exploring your app, filing bugs and tasks, and creating test cases.
