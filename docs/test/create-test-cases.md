# Create manual test cases

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

<a name="test-cases"></a>

Create manual test cases to check that each deliverable meets your users' needs. Manual test cases define individual steps testers perform, including steps that are shared across test cases. To test different data, you specify parameters for the test steps. To learn more, see [Share steps between test cases](share-steps-between-test-cases.md) and [Repeat a test with different data](repeat-test-with-different-data.md). For an overview of test artifacts, see [Test objects and terms](test-objects-overview.md).

Organize your test cases by adding them to test plans and test suites. Then assign testers to run the tests.

For an overview of test artifacts, see [Test objects and terms](test-objects-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Test iterations are designed to support data-driven scenarios, not workflow-driven scenarios.
  From a best practice perspective, if you have two test scenarios where the workflows are
  different, consider creating separate test cases. Also see [FAQs for manual testing](reference-qa.yml#testcases).

## Create test cases
::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"
1. If you haven't already, [create a test plan and requirement-based test suites](create-a-test-plan.md).

1. Select a requirement-based test suite.
   To the right, select the **New Test Case** button.
		
   ![Screenshot shows test cases with New Test Case button highlighted.](media/create-test-cases/new-test-case-button.png)

   If you have no existing test cases, the button appears in the lower right.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The [test suite](create-a-test-plan.md) shown here was created from a User Story work item in the team's backlog board.
   > When you add a test case to this kind of suite, the test case is automatically linked to the backlog item.
   > To create test cases this way, open the context menu for the work item and choose **Add test**.

1. In the new work item, enter a title. Select the **Click or type here to add a step** option.

   ![Screenshot shows the steps entered for a test case.](media/create-test-cases/test-case-steps.png)

   Add test steps with a description of the action required to carry out the test and the expected results so that any team member can run the test.
   You can add attachments to a step if you want.
   Repeat until you have added all the steps for the test.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can share steps between test cases. For more information, see [Share steps](share-steps-between-test-cases.md).

   Now you've created a test case that you can run.

You can also copy test cases. For more information, see [Copy or clone stories, issues and other work items](../boards/backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md).

## Assign configurations to test cases

You can specify configurations, such as different operating systems, web browsers, and other variations for your tests.

To assign test configurations to all test cases in a test suite, select the test suite, select **More options** or right-click to open the context menu, and then select **Assign configurations**.

In the **Assign configurations to test suite** dialog box, select the configurations you want.

![Screenshot shows the Assign configurations to test suite dialog box with some options selected.](media/create-test-cases/assign-configurations-test-suite.png)

You can also assign configurations to individual test cases. Select one or more test cases, select **More options** or right-click to open the context menu, and then select **Assign configuration**.

The **Assign configurations to selected test cases** dialog box opens. Make and save your changes.

For more information about configurations, see [Test different configurations](test-different-configurations.md).

## Reorder test cases

You can reorder manual test cases in static suites, requirement-based suites, and query-based suites.
Open a test case, then use the up and down arrows to change the order.

![Screenshot showing the arrows used to move test steps up or down.](media/create-test-cases/change-step-order.png)

There are also options to change order in the step context menu.

## Add existing test cases to a test suite

You can add existing test cases to a test suite.

1. Select a test suite. From the **New Test Case** menu, select **Add existing test case**.

   ![Screenshot shows the Add existing test cases option to select.](media/create-test-cases/add-existing-test-cases.png)

## Assign testers

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"
You can reassign test cases so that a different tester can run them.
You can assign all the test cases in a test suite to multiple testers, which is useful for acceptance testing.

Testers need [Basic access](../organizations/security/access-levels.md) to run tests from Azure Test Plans.

1. In the context menu for a test suite, select **Assign testers to run all tests**.

   ![Screenshot shows the Assign testers to run all tests option in a test suite context menu.](media/create-test-cases/assign-testers-all-tests.png)

   The **Select testers to run all the tests in suite** dialog box opens.

1. Add or remove testers from the list. After you select the testers, select **Send email**
   and edit the message as required so they know that tests are ready for them to run.

   ![Screenshot shows Assigning testers to run all tests dialog box with Search users and Send email called out.](media/create-test-cases/select-testers-dialog-box.png)

   The email contains a link that testers can open to see the list of assigned tests.

You can assign an individual test case to a tester.

1. In the **Execute** tab for a test suite, select a test, and then open the context menu.

   ![Screenshot shows the context menu for a test case with the Assign tester option selected.](media/create-test-cases/assign-tester-test-case.png)

1. Select **Assign tester**. Search for and select a tester.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<=azure-devops-2019"
1. You can reassign test cases so that another tester can 
   run them. Select the tests that you want to reassign. Then 
   open the shortcut menu (choose the "..." ellipses or right-click) 
   and select the tester you want to run the tests.

   ![Reassigning tests to a different tester](media/create-test-cases/AssignTester.png)

   Or, you can assign all the test cases in a test suite to multiple testers.
