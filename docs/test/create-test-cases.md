# Create manual test cases

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

<a name="test-cases"></a>

Create manual test cases to check that each deliverable meets your users' needs. Manual test cases define individual steps testers perform, including steps that are shared across test cases. To test different data, you specify parameters for the test steps. For more information, see [Share steps between test cases](share-steps-between-test-cases.md) and [Repeat a test with different data](repeat-test-with-different-data.md). For an overview of test artifacts, see [Test objects and terms](test-objects-overview.md).

Organize your test cases by adding them to test plans and test suites, and then assign testers to run the tests. For more information, see [Test objects and terms](test-objects-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Test iterations are designed to support data-driven scenarios, not workflow-driven scenarios.
  From a best practice perspective, if you have two test scenarios where the workflows are
  different, consider creating separate test cases. Also see [FAQs for manual testing](reference-qa.yml#testcases).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [prerequisites-define](includes/prerequisites-define.md)] 

<a name="createcase"></a>

## Create test cases

::: moniker range=">=azure-devops-2020"
1. If you haven't already, [create a test plan and requirement-based test suites](create-a-test-plan.md).

2. Select a requirement-based test suite and select **New Test Case**.
		
   ![Screenshot showing test cases with New Test Case button highlighted.](media/create-test-cases/new-test-case-button.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The [test suite](create-a-test-plan.md) shown here was created from a User Story work item in the team's backlog board. When you add a test case to this kind of suite, the test case automatically links to the backlog item. To create test cases this way, open the context menu for the work item and choose **Add test**.

3. In the new work item, enter a title and select **Click or type here to add a step**.

   ![Screenshot showing the steps entered for a test case.](media/create-test-cases/test-case-steps.png)

4. Add test steps with a description of the action required to carry out the test and the expected results so that any team member can run the test. You can add attachments to a step if you want. Repeat until you add all the steps for the test.

   A test case that you can run gets created.
   
   For more information, see [Share steps](share-steps-between-test-cases.md) and [Copy or clone stories, issues and other work items](../boards/backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md).

## Assign configurations to test cases

You can specify configurations, such as different operating systems, web browsers, and other variations for your tests.

- Select the test suite > **More options** > **Assign configurations**, and in the dialog box, select your configurations.

![Screenshot showing the Assign configurations to test suite dialog box with some options selected.](media/create-test-cases/assign-configurations-test-suite.png)

   You can also assign configurations to individual test cases. Select one or more test cases, select **More options** > **Assign configuration**.
   
- Make your changes and then **Save**.

For more information, see [Test different configurations](test-different-configurations.md).

## Reorder test cases

You can reorder manual test cases in static suites, requirement-based suites, and query-based suites.

Open a test case, and then use the up and down arrows to change the order.

![Screenshot showing the arrows used to move test steps up or down.](media/create-test-cases/change-step-order.png)

   > To create test cases this way, open the shortcut menu for the work item and choose **Add test**.    

2. Choose the **Click or type here to add a step** link and add test steps
   with a description of the action required to carry out the test and the
   expected results so that any team member can run the test.
   You can add attachments to a step if you want. Repeat until you add
   all the steps for the test.
   ![Screenshot showing creating the steps for a new manual test case.](media/create-test-cases/CreateTest_3.png)

   You can share steps between test cases. For more information, see [Share steps](share-steps-between-test-cases.md).

   [How can I find an existing test case within a test plan?](create-a-test-plan.md#findplan)

You can reorder manual test cases in static suites, requirement-based suites, and query-based suites.
Choose **Order tests** on the tool bar, then drag and drop one or more tests.

### Use tags for test cases

You can tag test cases and view only the ones with specific tags.
For example, tag all the tests related to signing in so that you can rerun these tests if a bug is fixed for that page.
You can filter on that tag from the **Test Plans** web portal.

To add new tags to add to work items, have at least **Basic** access and have the project-level **Create new tag definition permissions** set to **Allow**. for more information, see [Add work item tags](../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md).

You can add and edit tags when you edit a test case, or bulk edit tags in the **Grid** view.
You can also create suites based on queries when you use tags.

![Screenshot showing tags for a test case.](media/create-test-cases/test-case-tags.png)

## Rename or remove test cases

You can rename or remove test cases. Open the test case from its context menu.

![Screenshot showing a test case with its context menu with Open test case selected.](media/create-test-cases/open-test-case-option.png)

Here you can rename the test case.

![Screenshot showing a test case with its name selected to edit.](media/create-test-cases/change-test-case-name.png)

Or you can remove the test case from the test suite. From the context menu for the test case, select **Remove**.
