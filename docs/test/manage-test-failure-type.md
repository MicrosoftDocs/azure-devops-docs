# Manage test failure type

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

Azure Test Plans provides the functionality to customize the failure types of any test case beyond the default values. A **failure type** is an artifact that helps to mark test case failures into defined categories such as **regression issue** or **known issue**. While this categorization of failure types is helpful, users might want to add their own custom failure type beyond the default values, which creates a more customized experience for specific user needs in the Azure DevOps project. This article walks through the steps of defining a custom failure type using the new REST API provided. 

## Prerequisites

## How to view the default failure types

Failure type categorization is part of the post-test run experience in Azure Test Plans. This feature is only applicable to test cases marked as **Failed**. To mark a test failure using the default failure type, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to Azure Test Plans from your Azure DevOps project. Open a Test suite containing test cases or create a new test case inside a suite.

2. Navigate to Execute tab of the given test suite.

3. Mark a test case as **Failed**, which creates a new test run for against the test case.

## Add custom values for Failure Type

A new set of REST APIs is provided for seamless management of failure types in Azure Test Plans. Users can add new failure types, delete existing ones and view the list of failure types for a given project.
Follow the instructions provided in the following links to explore the various APIs.

* [Create a new test failure type](/rest/api/azure/devops/testresults/testfailuretype/create)
* [Delete a test failure type with specified failureTypeId](/rest/api/azure/devops/testresults/testfailuretype/delete)
* [Get the list of test failure types](/rest/api/azure/devops/testresults/testfailuretype/list)
