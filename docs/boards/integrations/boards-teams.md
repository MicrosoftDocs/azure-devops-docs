# Azure Boards with Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-azure-boards-plus-azure-devops-server-2020.md)]

If you use [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), you can create work items and monitor work item activity in your Azure Boards project from your Teams channel. You accomplish this by adding the [Azure Boards app for Microsoft Teams](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200000644?tab=Overview) to your Teams channel.

The Azure Boards app for Microsoft Teams enables users to perform the following tasks: 
- Set up and manage subscriptions for creating and updating work items
- Manage other work item events
- Receive and manage notifications for work item events in their Teams channel
- Create work items from conversations in the channel
- Search and share work items with other members in the channel using the messaging extension
- View work item previews from their URLs to initiate discussions and keep the conversations contextual.

Read this article to learn how to: 

> [!div class="checklist"]  
> * Add the Azure Boards app to your team in Microsoft Teams
> * Link and unlink your Azure Boards project to the Azure Boards app
> * Set up subscriptions to work item related events in your Teams channel
> * Create work items from your Teams channel
> * Monitor work item activity in your Teams channel  


## Prerequisites

- To create a work item, you must be a contributor to the Azure Boards project. If you don't have a project yet, you can sign up and create a project. For details, see [Start using Azure Boards](../get-started/index.md). 
- To create subscriptions in a Teams channel for work item events, you must be a member of the Azure Boards Project Administrators group or Team Administrators group. To get added, see [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or [Add Team Administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md). 
- To receive notifications, you must enable the **Third-party application access via OAuth** setting for the organization. See [Change application access policies for your organization](../../organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies.md)

> [!NOTE]
> * You can link the Azure Boards app for Microsoft Teams only to a project hosted on Azure DevOps Services at this time.  
> * Notifications are currently not supported inside direct messages.

## Add the Azure Boards app to Microsoft Teams

You add the app to your Teams channel in Microsoft Teams.

1. Visit the App store in Microsoft Teams and search for the Azure Boards app. Upon installing, a welcome message from the app displays as shown in the following image. 

	![Pic: Welcome message](./media/integrations-teams/welcome-message.png)

2. Use the `@azure boards` handle to interact with the app. For a list of commands, see [Command reference](#command-reference) provided later in this article.

## Link your Azure Boards project to the Azure Boards app

To use the app, you must first link your Azure Boards project to your Teams channel. 

1. Once the app has been installed in your team, connect and authenticate yourself to Azure Boards. Use **Sign in with different email** if your Microsoft Teams and Azure Boards are in different tenants. 

	![Connect and authenticate yourself to Azure Boards.](./media/integrations-teams/signin1.png)
	
	![Connect and authenticate yourself to Azure Boards, step 2.](./media/integrations-teams/signin2.png)

2. After signing in, use the following command inside a Teams channel to link to the Azure Boards project that you specify with the URL:

	```
	@azure boards link [project url]
	```

	For example:

	```
	@azure boards link https://dev.azure.com/myorg/myproject
	```

Once the project is linked, you can create work items using `@azure boards create` command or use message actions. 

## Set up subscriptions

You can create subscriptions to monitor work items at any time using the `@azure boards subscriptions` command.  

1. Select the desired area path and event that you are interested in. Use the associated 
filters to customize what you get notified on in your Teams channel. To help easily set up subscriptions, your recently accessed area paths are shown in the area path dropdown.

	![Set up subscriptions.](./media/integrations-teams/add-subscriptions.png)

In case the desired area path doesn't appear in the Area path dropdown menu, follow the instructions mentioned in the next section, [Add area paths](#add-area-paths). Area paths added using the `@azure boards addAreapath` command and area paths for which subscriptions are created in the channel always appear in the Area path dropdown along with recently accessed area paths.


## Add area paths

You can add areas that your team works on to the channel so that they are always available for creating work items and subscriptions. This feature is useful for teams with more than 100 area paths in their project. 

- Use the following command to add area paths from your project to the Teams channel.

	```
	@azure boards addAreapath [area path] 
	```

	For example:

	```
	@azure boards addAreapath myproject\fabrikam
	```

	![add areapath success message](./media/integrations-teams/add-areapath.png)
	
 - If you choose project name as your area path, then you'll receive notifications for all the area paths in the project.  

## Create a work item with a command

With the Azure Boards app, you can create work items from your channel. The app supports custom work items as well.

- To create a work item, use `@azure boards create`. 

	![Create work item using command](./media/integrations-teams/create-work-item-command.png)


## Create a work item from message actions

Often, discussions in a channel require creation of work items. You can use message actions to create a work item. The selected message is pre-filled in the description section of the work item. The Discussion section of the newly added work item stores a link back to the conversation in the channel.  

- To create work items using message actions

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create work item using message action](./media/integrations-teams/message-action-1.png)
	
	> ![Create work item using message action, step 2.](./media/integrations-teams/message-action-2.png)


## Manage subscriptions

1. To view, add and remove subscriptions for a channel, use the `@azure boards subscriptions` command:

	```
	@azure boards subscriptions
	```

This command lists all the current subscriptions for the channel and allows you to add new subscriptions and remove existing ones. As part of adding subscriptions, you can also customize what you get notified on by using various filters.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![View subscriptions](./media/integrations-teams/view-subscriptions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Team administrators aren't able to remove or modify subscriptions created by Project administrators.

## Search and share work items using compose extension

To help users search and share work items, the Azure Boards app for Microsoft Teams supports compose extension. You can search for work items by work item ID or by title. For compose extension to work, users must sign in to Azure Boards app either by running `@azure boards signin` command or by signing into the compose extension directly.

![Signing into the compose extension.](./media/integrations-teams/teams-boards-compose-extension.png)

## Preview work item URLs

To support collaboration around work items discussed within a channel, the channel displays a preview of work items referenced. When a user pastes the work item URL, a preview is shown similar to the following image. This preview helps to keep work item-related conversations relevant and accurate. 

![Work item URL unfurling.](./media/integrations-teams/url-unfurling.png)

For this feature to work, users must be signed in. Once signed in, this feature works for all channels in a team in Microsoft Teams.

## Unlink a project from a channel

A Teams channel can only link to one Azure Boards project at a time. To link to a different project, you must first unlink the current project using `@azure boards unlink` command. 

Unlinking a project deletes all the subscriptions along with added area paths from the channel. If the channel has no subscriptions, any user can unlink a project. However if a channel has subscriptions, only project admins can unlink a project from a channel.

## Threaded notifications

The Teams channel threads notifications so as to logically link and reduce related notifications in the channel. All notifications linked to a particular work item are linked together.

### Compact view of threaded notifications

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Compact thread](./media/integrations-teams/threads-boards-compact-view.png)

### Expanded view of threaded notifications
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Expanded thread](./media/integrations-teams/threads-boards-expanded-view.png)

## Command reference

The following table lists all the `@azure boards` commands you can use in your Microsoft Teams channel.

 ## Troubleshoot 

If you are experiencing the following errors when using the [Azure Boards App for Microsoft Teams](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA200000644?tab=Overview), follow the procedures in this section.

[!INCLUDE [troubleshooting](includes/boards-troubleshoot-authentication.md)]

In the **same browser**, start a new tab, navigate to `https://teams.microsoft.com/`. Run the `@azure boards signout` command and then run the `@azure boards signin` command in the channel where the Azure Boards app for Microsoft Teams is installed. 

Select the `Sign in` button and you'll be redirected to a consent page like the one in the following example. Ensure that the directory shown beside the email is same as what was chosen in the previous step. Accept and complete the sign-in process.
