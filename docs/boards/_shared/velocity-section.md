## Velocity 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

When you assign your backlog items to sprints, you'll gain access to an in-context velocity report for both product and portfolio backlogs. Velocity helps teams determine how much work they can perform sprint-over-sprint. 

You can quickly configure the Velocity report to count work items or sum Story Points, Effort, Remaining Work or other numeric field.

The report tracks the team's estimated backlog work&mdash;sum of Effort (Basic or Scrum processes), Story Points (Agile process), or Size (CMMI process&mdash;that your team has completed (green) in the previous sprints, or that are still in progress (blue).
