> If your admin has installed the [Work item search extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-workitem-search), the search box will perform an ad hoc query using the extension.

To learn more, see [Ad hoc vs managed work item queries](/azure/devops/boards/queries/adhoc-vs-managed-queries).
