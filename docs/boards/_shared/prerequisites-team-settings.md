* You must be added to the team administrator role for the team's settings you want to modify, or be a member of the **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, see [Add a team administrator](/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-team-administrator) or [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions).
* You must be granted **Stakeholder** access or higher. For details, see [About access levels](/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels).
