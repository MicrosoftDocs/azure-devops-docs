### Quick tips on shared queries

If you are new to Azure Boards and TFS and shared queries, review these tips to learn how you can manage work more effectively:

-   To find work items that are assigned to you, add **@Me** as the value for the Assigned To field in one of the query clauses.  
-   All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the **My Queries** area. To create queries and query folders under **Shared Queries**, you must have the Contribute permission set. For more information, see [Set permissions on queries](/azure/devops/boards/queries/set-query-permissions).
-   You can modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an iteration, or another field. To modify a query, [open the query editor](/azure/devops/boards/queries/using-queries).   
-   You can open any query in [Excel](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel) or [Project](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project), where you can update the fields of one or more work items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.  
-   You can [visualize status or progress](/azure/devops/report/dashboards/charts) by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart for flat-list queries.
