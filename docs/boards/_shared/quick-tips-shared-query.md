You can [view and run queries](/azure/devops/boards/queries/view-run-query) from the web portal or from the Team Explorer plug-in to Visual Studio. You can modify a query using the [query editor to apply different filter criteria](/azure/devops/boards/queries/using-queries). Also, you can [add queries to team dashboards](/azure/devops/report/dashboards/dashboards).  


### Quick tips on shared queries

If you are new to Azure Boards, work tracking, and shared queries, review these tips to learn how you can manage work more effectively:

- To find work items that are assigned to you, add <strong>@Me</strong> as the value for the Assigned To field in one of the query clauses.  
- All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the **My Queries** area. To create queries and query folders under **Shared Queries**, you must have the Contribute permission set and have been assigned Basic access or greater. For more information, see [Set permissions on queries](/azure/devops/boards/queries/set-query-permissions).
- You can modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an iteration, or another field. To modify a query, [open the query editor](/azure/devops/boards/queries/using-queries).   
- You can open any query in [Excel](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel) or [Project](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project), where you can update the fields of one or more work items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.  
- You can [visualize status or progress](/azure/devops/report/dashboards/charts) by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart for flat-list queries.

> Starting with Visual Studio 2019, the Team Foundation plug-in for Office is deprecating support for Microsoft Project. Project integration and the **TFSFieldMapping** command is not supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019 nor for Azure DevOps Services. You can continue to use Microsoft Excel.
