Here's what you'll see when you preview the new form.

For guidance in using the new form features, see [Add work items to plan and track your project](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/add-work-items).   

## New form features  

### Consistent look and feel  

First off, you'll notice that the form reflects the color of your work item type&mdash;bug, user story, or task. And, we've done away with duplicate titles to cut down on clutter. Whether you're working from a backlog, board, or query&mdash;your experience remains the same.

### Great consumption experience  
 
Your data has more structure and organization. Plus, you can focus more easily on areas of interest by collapsing groups to hide details you don't care about. And as you resize the form, it quickly responds to provide you with a great viewing experience even within a limited screen width.

### More viewing area to support core experiences  
 
All the core tabs&mdash;Details, History, Links, and Attachments&mdash;now have more screen space. See [History and auditing](/azure/devops/boards/queries/history-and-auditing) for details on the new History tab.
