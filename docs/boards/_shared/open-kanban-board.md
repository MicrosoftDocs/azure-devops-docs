> [!NOTE]  
> Both Kanban boards and Taskboards support visualizing the flow of work and monitoring metrics to optimize that flow. Kanban boards track requirements, are sprint-independent, and provide a cumulative flow chart for monitoring progress. Each sprint is associated with a Taskboard that supports tracking tasks defined for the sprint. You can monitor progress through capacity charts and the sprint burndown chart. For guidance on using the Taskboard, see [Update and monitor your Taskboard](/azure/devops/boards/sprints/task-board).


## Open your Kanban board from the web portal

Your Kanban board is one of two types of boards available to you. The other is the sprint Taskboard. Kanban boards track requirements, are sprint-independent, and provide a cumulative flow chart for monitoring progress. Each sprint is associated with a Taskboard that supports tracking tasks defined for the sprint. You can monitor progress through capacity charts and the sprint burndown chart. For guidance on using the Taskboard, see [Update and monitor your Taskboard](/azure/devops/boards/sprints/task-board). For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans).
