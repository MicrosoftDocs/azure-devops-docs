## Open your Kanban board from the web portal

Your Kanban board is one of two types of boards available to you. For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans). To switch to the [product backlog](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog), select **Stories backlog**. To switch to the [task board](/azure/devops/boards/sprints/task-board), select **Sprints** and then select **Taskboard**.

> [!NOTE]
> Your web portal uses either the **New navigation** or **Previous navigation** user interface. Choose the **New navigation** tab if the **New Navigation** feature is enabled. You'll see a vertical sidebar along with other navigational features when **New Navigation** has been enabled for the signed-in user or the organization. Choose **Previous navigation** when you see a top-level, blue-bar&mdash;indicating that **New navigation** isn't enabled. For more information, see [Web portal navigation](/azure/devops/project/navigation/index).

Choose the **Previous navigation** tab for guidance. TFS 2018 and earlier versions only support the previous navigation user interface. For more information, see [Web portal navigation](/azure/devops/project/navigation/index).
