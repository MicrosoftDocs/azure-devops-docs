## Open the Work Items page
You can start viewing and adding work items once you connect to a project. 

<a id="browser" /> 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

(1) Check that you have selected the right project, then (2) choose **Boards>Work Items**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open Boards>Work Items](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/_img/view-add/open-work-items-agile.png)

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

Open a browser window, choose **Work**, and then **Work Items**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
![Boards>Work Items ](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/_img/view-add/work-items-hub.png)

::: moniker-end


> [!NOTE]    
> Depending on the process chosen when the project was created&mdash;[Basic](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/track-issues-tasks), [Agile](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process-workflow), [Scrum](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process-workflow), or [CMMI](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process-workflow)&mdash;the types of work items you can create will differ. For example, backlog items may be called issues (Basic), user stories (Agile), product backlog items (Scrum), or requirements (CMMI). All three are similar: they describe the customer value to deliver and the work to be performed.
