## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

* You must connect to a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/sign-up-invite-teammates). 
* You must be added to a project as a member of the **Contributors** or **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, [Add users to a project or team](/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-users-team-project). 
* To add or modify work items, you must be granted **Stakeholder** access or higher. For details, see [About access levels](/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels).
* To view or modify work items, you must have your **View work items in this node** and **Edit work items in this node** permissions set to **Allow**. By default, the **Contributors** group has this permission set. To learn more, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking).  
* To create new tags to add to work items, you must have **Basic** access or higher and have the project-level **Create new tag definition** permissions set to **Allow**. By default, the **Contributors** group has this permission set. Even if the permission is explicitly set for a **Stakeholder**, they won't have permission to add new tags, as they are prohibited through their access level.
