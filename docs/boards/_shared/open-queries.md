From your web browser, (1) check that you have selected the right project, (2) choose **Boards>Queries**, and then (3) choose **All**.

If it is your first time opening **Work**, the page opens to **Favorites** which lists all queries you have favorited. Otherwise, you can choose **All** to view all queries you've defined and shared queries defined for the project.  

> [!TIP]    
> Queries you or your team have favorited show up on the **Favorites** page. Queries you have favorited along with other objects also appear on your **Project** page. To learn more, see [Set personal or team favorites](/azure/devops/project/navigation/set-favorites).
