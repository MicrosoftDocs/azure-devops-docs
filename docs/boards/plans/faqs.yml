      - question: Can I use Delivery Plans 2.0 with Azure DevOps Server 2020?
        answer: |
          No. Delivery Plans 2.0 requires Azure DevOps Server 2022 or later (RC1 and later for preview releases).

      - question: Why don't my work items show on the plan?
        answer: |
          Check that each work item has either an Iteration Path or a Start Date and Target Date. Also verify that the teams selected in the plan include the Iteration Paths you expect. If the plan doesn't include those iteration selections, items in those iterations don't appear.

      - question: How do I show dependency lines?
        answer: |
          Select the bottom area of a card to toggle dependency lines for that work item on and off. Clicking the bottom of the card shows the dependency lines; select it again (or select elsewhere) to hide them.

      - question: Why can't I see all fields and tags I configured on cards?
        answer: |
          Delivery Plans selectively displays fields based on zoom level to avoid card clutter. In the plan settings (Fields), add the fields you want on cards. Increase the zoom level (+) to reveal more fields and tags.

      - question: Can I view custom work item types on Delivery Plans?
        answer: |
          Yes. Add a custom work item type to an appropriate backlog level as described in [Customize your backlogs or boards (Inheritance process)](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md). Delivery Plans include items from backlog levels that you configure.
