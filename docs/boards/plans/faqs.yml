      - question: Can I use Delivery Plans 2.0 with Azure DevOps Server 2020?
        answer: |
          Not at this time. Delivery Plans 2.0 will be made available with Azure DevOps Server 2022. 

      - question: Why don't my work items show on the plan?
        answer: |
          Make sure your work items are assigned to an Iteration Path, or a Start Date and Target Date. Also, verify that the Iteration Paths have been selected for the teams whose backlog levels are chosen for the Delivery Plans. If the Iteration Paths aren't selected, work items associated with those iterations won't display.    

      - question: How do I get dependency lines to show?
        answer: |
          Click  the bottom of the card to show the dependency lines of the work item. To turn them off, click on the bottom of the card or anywhere else in the plan. Clicking the bottom of the card is a toggle for the display of the dependency lines. 

      - question: Why can't I see all the fields I've configured?
        answer: |
          In the settings under the **Fields** section, you can add  fields display on the cards. However, depending on the number of fields and the zoom level, not all fields are displayed.  Selective field display based on zoom level is a design decision that was made to avoid card clutter. To see all the fields on a card, continue to increase (+) the zoom level until they fully display.
 
      - question: Can I view custom work item types on Delivery Plans?  
        answer: |
          **Yes**. Add your custom work item type to a backlog level as described in [Customize your backlogs or boards (Inheritance process)](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md).
