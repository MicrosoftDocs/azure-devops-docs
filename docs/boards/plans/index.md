# Scale Agile practices across teams

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

As organizations grow, Azure Boards provides scalable tools to extend Agile practices across multiple teams and projects. The platform's team-based architecture enables both team autonomy and organizational visibility, supporting everything from small startups to large organizations.

## Core scaling approach

Azure Boards scales through a flexible team model where each team operates independently while contributing to larger organizational goals. This approach provides:

- **Team autonomy** with dedicated backlogs, boards, and sprint planning
- **Organizational visibility** through portfolio rollups and cross-team reporting
- **Flexible hierarchies** that adapt to your organizational structure
- **Coordinated delivery** across multiple teams and projects

Each team gets their own configurable set of Agile tools while maintaining connections to the broader organizational context. For guidance on team setup, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

## Scaling capabilities

### Portfolio management

Portfolio management in Azure Boards enables executives and program managers to gain visibility across multiple teams and projects. Key capabilities include:

- **Multi-level work hierarchies** from epics down to tasks across teams
- **Cross-team progress tracking** with rollup reporting
- **Resource allocation visibility** and capacity planning
- **Dependency management** between teams and projects
- **Leadership dashboards** with high-level metrics and KPIs

Portfolio views help leaders understand delivery progress, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions about resource allocation and priorities.

### Delivery plans

Delivery Plans provide timeline-based coordination for multi-team environments. These interactive calendar views show:

- **Cross-team feature delivery** across multiple sprints
- **Timeline visualization** of planned work and milestones
- **Dependency relationships** between teams and work items
- **Capacity planning** and resource allocation insights
- **Release coordination** for complex, multi-team deliveries

Delivery Plans help program managers coordinate releases, identify scheduling conflicts, and ensure aligned execution across development teams.

### Multi-team dashboards

Azure Boards provides flexible dashboard capabilities for both operational and strategic reporting:

- **Team dashboards** for sprint tracking and daily operations
- **Program dashboards** aggregating metrics across multiple teams
- **Leadership dashboards** with strategic KPIs and health indicators
- **Custom widgets** for organization-specific metrics
- **Real-time data** reflecting current project status

You can tailor dashboards to different audiences, from developers tracking sprint progress to leaders monitoring overall portfolio health.

## When to use scaling features

### Portfolio management
Use portfolio management when you need:
- Visibility across multiple teams or projects
- Leadership reporting on delivery progress
- Cross-team dependency tracking
- Resource allocation planning at scale

### Delivery plans
Use delivery plans when you need:
- Coordinated releases across multiple teams
- Timeline visualization of feature delivery
- Dependency management between teams
- Capacity planning across sprints and teams

### Multi-team dashboards
Use multi-team dashboards when you need:
- Stakeholder reporting at various organizational levels
- Real-time visibility into project health
- Custom metrics specific to your organization
- Automated reporting to reduce manual overhead

## Scaling considerations

### Organizational factors
- **Team structure**: How teams are organized and their relationships
- **Communication patterns**: How information flows between teams
- **Decision-making processes**: Who makes what decisions and when
- **Reporting needs**: What visibility different stakeholders require

### Technical factors
- **Work item hierarchies**: How work is broken down and organized
- **Area path strategy**: How to organize work by feature or team boundaries
- **Iteration alignment**: Whether teams share sprint schedules or operate independently
- **Integration needs**: How Azure Boards connects with other development tools

### Cultural factors
- **Agile maturity**: How comfortable teams are with Agile practices
- **Collaboration patterns**: How teams work together and share information
- **Change management**: How the organization adapts to new processes and tools
- **Continuous improvement**: How teams and the organization learn and evolve

## Getting started with scaling features

Azure Boards scaling capabilities build upon foundational team practices. Organizations typically evolve their usage as they grow:

1. **Start with individual teams** using basic backlogs and boards

3. **Implement portfolio management** for leadership reporting
4. **Scale delivery planning** for complex, multi-team releases

The platform grows with your organization, supporting both simple team workflows and complex organizational scenarios.
