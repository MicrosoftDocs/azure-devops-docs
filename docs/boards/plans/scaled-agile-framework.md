# Implement Scaled Agile Framework&reg; in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Many enterprises benefit from individual Agile teams. Greater interest grows to scale Agile practices as the organization grows. The need for enterprises to view progress of many Agile teams and across a portfolio continues to increase. To address these needs, many businesses have adopted the Scaled Agile Framework&reg; (SAFe&reg;). 

If you're familiar with Scrum but not familiar with SAFe®, [these videos at Scaled Agile](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/videos-and-presentations/) are a good way to orient yourself.  

Azure Boards supports SAFe® practices through its autonomous teams, backlogs, boards, reports, and metrics. This article introduces you to how Azure Boards artifacts support SAFe practices and artifacts.

## Scaled Agile Framework®

The SAFe® addresses how a portfolio vision is met by a hierarchy of teams, all concerned with specific goals. This framework breaks down Epics into Features and Stories. Teams work on these items in Sprints and deliver through Program Increments (PIs) and Release Trains. Furthermore, the portfolio backlog can track deliverables that map to value streams and associated budgets.

### SAFe® 5.0 Business Agility 

Many SAFe® practices include growing a culture that supports agility, alignment, and autonomy, all while being customer-centric.

Some of the ways Azure Boards supports business agility and agile culture are discussed in the following articles: 
- [Agile culture](agile-culture.md)
- [Practices that scale](practices-that-scale.md)

## Essential SAFe®

Essential SAFe&reg; requires support for the artifacts and practices illustrated in the following poster.

All of these artifacts and practices are supported by Azure Boards. 

- **Stories, Features**, and **Enablers**: Implemented as work items that capture information and status of work. These work items automatically appear on team backlogs and Kanban boards. 
- **Team Backlogs** and **Program Backlogs**: Implemented as team backlogs that filter work items assigned to a team and support prioritizing and grouping of work.  
- **Scrum** and **Kanban**: Practices that are fully supported using Kanban boards, Sprint backlogs and Taskboards, teams, and sprint cadences. 
- **Iterations**, **Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration**, **Program Increments (PI)**, **Milestones**, and **Release Trains**: Implemented via a flat-list or a hierarchical configuration of Iteration Paths. 
- **Agile Release Train**: Implemented by a set of Agile teams and Program teams configured to support specific team and program views. 
- **PI Objectives**, **Team Goals**, and  **Solution context**: Teams can use the built-in project wiki to share objectives, goals, customer information, and solution requirements.   

For an overview of how Azure Boards implements Scrum and Kanban, see [About Sprints, Scrum, and project management](../sprints/scrum-overview.md) and [About Boards and Kanban](../boards/kanban-overview.md).


## Portfolio SAFe®

Portfolio SAFe® adds support for managing portfolios through epics, enablers, and value streams.  

[![Portfolio SAFe® poster architectural overview &copy; D. Leffingwell](media/safe/portfolio-safe-poster.png)](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/)

Azure Boards provides supports for the following portfolio components:

- **Epics**: Map to the Epic work item type and allow tracking, grouping, and rollup of child items. 
- **Portfolio backlogs**: Implemented as a portfolio backlog that supports filtering of work based on review of business needs.  
- **Portfolio Vision** and **Strategic Themes**: Business owners and portfolio managers can use the built-in project wiki to share their vision, objectives, and goals. 
- **Value Streams**: Value streams can be tracked using tags or custom fields. 
- **Lean budgets**: Budget information can be captured in custom fields and rolled up to gain visibility to the Feature and Epic levels. 
- **KPIs**: Several reports and dashboard widgets provide out-of-the box metrics. Power BI and the Analytics service provide support to create custom reports quickly. 

## Large Solution SAFe®

Large Solutions SAFe® includes support for a Solution Backlog, Solution Trains, and Capabilities.

You can implement large solutions in much the same way as you implement Portfolio SAFe®. However, you can also add custom work item types and custom backlogs to support other solution requirements.       


### Full SAFe® 

Full SAFe® includes the three levels of Essential SAFe®, Large Solution SAFe®, and Portfolio SAFe®.
