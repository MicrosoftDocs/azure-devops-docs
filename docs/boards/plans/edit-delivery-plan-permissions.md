## Edit permissions for a delivery plan


::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. Open **Boards>Delivery Plans**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot to Open Boards>Plans.](media/plans/open-plans.png) 

1. To grant permissions to a group or user to manage or edit a specific plan, choose  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: **More options** to open the **Security** dialog for the plan.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open the Permissions dialog for a plan](media/permissions/open-security.png)  
2. Add a user, team group, or other security group who you want to grant permissions to or restrict access. For details, see [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md). By default, non-administrators can't delete or edit a plan. 

3. With the user or group selected, set the permission you want them to have to **Allow**. **Manage** set to **Allow** enables the user to manage permissions for the plan.

	For example, here we grant permission to Cristina to edit the plan.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Permissions dialog for a delivery plan](media/permissions/permissions-dialog-change-s186.png)

4. When done, close the dialog. The changes are automatically saved.
