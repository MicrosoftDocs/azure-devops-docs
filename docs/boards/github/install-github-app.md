# Install the Azure Boards app for GitHub  

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Install the Azure Boards app for GitHub to connect Azure Boards to your GitHub repositories. When you connect Azure Boards projects with GitHub.com repositories, you support linking between GitHub commits and pull requests to work items. You can use GitHub for software development while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work. 
 
For an overview of the integration that the Azure Boards app for GitHub supports, see [Azure Boards-GitHub integration](index.md). Once you install the Azure Boards app for GitHub on your GitHub account or organization, choose which GitHub repositories you want to connect to from your project.

## Prerequisites 

* To install the Azure Boards app, you must be an administrator or owner of the GitHub organization.
* To connect to the Azure Boards project, you must have read permission to the GitHub repository. Also, you must be a member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../../organizations/security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md). If you created the project, then you have permissions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If your repository is already connected via another authentication type such as OAuth, you must remove that repository from your existing connection before you re-connect it via the GitHub App. Follow the steps provided in [Add or remove GitHub repositories](#add-remove-repos) later in this article before you configure the GitHub App.
>
> You can connect an Azure DevOps organization to multiple GitHub repositories if you're an administrator for those repositories. However, you shouldn't connect a GitHub repository to more than one Azure DevOps organization.

## Give Azure Boards organization access 

Do the following steps to grant organization access. 

1. From the GitHub web portal, open **Settings** from your profile menu.

2. Select **Applications** under **Integrations**.  

3. Select **Authorized OAuth Apps** > **Azure Boards**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot/open-azure-boards.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Authorized OAuth Apps tab, choose Azure Boards.":::   

4. Under **Organization access**, resolve any issues that may appear. Select **Grant** to grant access to any organizations that show as having an **Access request pending**.

## Use the connection 

At this point, your Azure Boards-GitHub integration is complete. You can skip the next steps or run through them to understand the features supported with the connection.  

1. Select **Create** to add a work item&mdash;Issue (Basic), User Story (Agile), or Product Backlog Item (Scrum)&mdash;depending on the process model used by your Azure Boards project. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-app/get-started-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Get started, Create issue dialog.":::

	A work item titled *Add badge to README* appears on your Azure Boards. 

2. Select **Create and link a pull request**. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-app/get-started-issue-created.png" alt-text="Success screenshot, GitHub repo is connected to Azure Boards.":::

	This step runs the following actions in the background:  
	- Adds a badge to the README file of the first repository in the list of connected GitHub repositories  
	- Creates a GitHub commit for the update made by adding the badge to the README file
	- Creates a GitHub pull request to merge the changes made to the README file  
	- Links the GitHub commit and pull request to the work item created in step 1.  

3. Select **View work item** to open the work item you created in step 1. Note the links under the **Development** section that correspond to the commit and pull request created in GitHub.com

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-app/get-started-view-work-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of viewing work item.":::

4.	Choose the pull request link, the first link in the list, to open the pull request in GitHub.  

	The GitHub pull request opens in a new browser tab.

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-app/issue-add-badge.png" alt-text="Screenshot of issue form.":::

5. Complete the pull request.

## Update Azure Boards-GitHub connections
 
If you change the repositories that the Azure Boards app for GitHub supports, you may be redirected to Azure Boards GitHub connections. A good practice is to remove the repositories in Azure Boards that can no longer connect to GitHub. For more information, see [Add or remove GitHub repositories](#add-remove-repos).

If you uninstall the Azure Boards app for GitHub, you'll see the following message in Azure Boards, **Project Settings>GitHub** Connections. Choose **Remove connection** to remove all GitHub connections that have been previously made. See also, [Add or remove GitHub repositories](#add-remove-repos).
