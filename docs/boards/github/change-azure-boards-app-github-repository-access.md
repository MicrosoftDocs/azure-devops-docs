[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)] 

Once you [install the Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md), you can change the configuration and suspend operations. You can also uninstall the app. To learn more about Azure Boards and GitHub, see [GitHub integration overview](index.md). 

[!INCLUDE[temp](../includes/github-platform-support.md)]


## Prerequisites  

The procedures provided in this article only apply when you've installed the Azure Boards app for GitHub. For details, see [Install and configure the Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md).

* To manage the Azure Boards integration, you must be the owner or administrator of the GitHub organization. You can connect to multiple GitHub repositories so long as you're an administrator for those repositories.  


## Change repository access

1. Sign into the web portal for your GitHub organization and open **Account settings**. 

	`https://github.com/organizations/fabrikam-fiber/settings/profile` 

1. Choose **Installed GitHub Apps** and then **Configure** next to **Azure Boards**.

	The Azure Boards configuration page opens. 

1. Scroll down to the **Repository access** section. 

1. Choose the option you want, **All repositories** or **Only select repositories**. 

	If you choose **Only select repositories**, select the repositories you want to participate in integration with Azure Boards.

## Update Azure Boards' GitHub connections
 
If you change the repositories that the Azure Boards app for GitHub supports, you may be redirected to Azure Boards GitHub connections. A good practice is to remove the repositories in Azure Boards that can no longer connect to GitHub. For details, see [Add or remove GitHub repositories](add-remove-repositories.md).

If you uninstall the Azure Boards app for GitHub, you'll see the following message in Azure Boards, **Project Settings>GitHub** Connections. Choose **Remove connection** to remove all GitHub connections that have been previously made. See also, [Add or remove GitHub repositories](add-remove-repositories.md).
