# Connect Azure Boards to GitHub (Cloud) 

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)] 
 
To support linking of GitHub commits and pull requests to Azure Boards work items, you connect your Azure Boards project to GitHub.com repositories. Then, use GitHub for software development while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work. For an overview of the Azure Boards app for GitHub, see [Azure Boards-GitHub integration](index.md).  

When you make the connection from Azure Boards, the list of GitHub repositories corresponds to ones that you allow Azure Boards to access. You can limit which repositories Azure Boards accesses overall, and limit what a particular project accesses or split the management of work across different Azure Boards projects.

> [!NOTE]   
> Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services support integration with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. If you want to connect from an on-premises Azure DevOps Server, see [Connect Azure DevOps Server to GitHub Enterprise Server](connect-on-premises-to-github.md).


## Prerequisites 

* Connect to an Azure Boards or Azure DevOps project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../get-started/sign-up-invite-teammates.md). 
* You must be a member of the [**Project Administrators** group](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md). If you created the project, you have permissions. 
* You must be an administrator or owner of the GitHub repository you'll connect to. You can connect to multiple GitHub repositories so long as you're an administrator for those repositories.   

## Authentication options

The following authentication options are supported based on the GitHub platform you want to connect to.  

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      **GitHub.com**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      **GitHub Enterprise Server**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      - [GitHub.com user account (Recommended)](#server-github-ent-username)
      - [Personal access token (PAT)](#github-pat)
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      - [OAuth (preferred, registration required)](#server-github-ent-oauth-register) 
      - [PAT](#server-github-ent-pat) 
      - [Username plus password](#server-github-ent-username) 
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
 
 > [!NOTE]
 >  If you choose to connect Github with PAT, make sure you configure single sign-on (SSO) for the PAT on your GitHub account. This is needed to be able to get a list of repositories of an organization with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) SSO authentication configured.
 
## Open Project Settings>GitHub Connections.

1. Sign into Azure Boards for the project you want to connect to GitHub repositories.  

1. Choose (1) **Project Settings**> (2) **GitHub connections**.   

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/open-project-settings-github-connections.png" alt-text="Screenshot of open Project Settings>GitHub connections.":::

1.	If it's the first time making a connection from the project, choose **Connect your GitHub account** to use your GitHub account credentials. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/connect-github-account-first-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot of first time connecting with GitHub credentials.":::

	Otherwise, choose :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/add-light-icon.png" border="false"::: **New connection**, and select your authentication method from the **New Connection** dialog.

	When you connect using your GitHub account, use your GitHub account credentials to authenticate. If connecting using PAT, see [Add a GitHub connection using PAT](#github-pat). If connecting to a GitHub Enterprise Server, see [Register Azure DevOps in GitHub as an OAuth App](#server-github-ent-oauth-register).

## Add a GitHub connection with GitHub credentials 

You can connect up to 250 GitHub repositories to an Azure Boards project. 

1. 	If it's your first time connecting to GitHub from Azure Boards, you'll be asked to sign in using your GitHub credentials. Choose an account for which you're an administrator for the repositories you want to connect to. 

1. If you belong to more than one GitHub account or organization, choose the one whose repositories you want to connect. Only those organizations that you  own or are an administrator for are listed.  

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/multiple-github-orgs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of choosing from multiple GitHub organizations to connect to."::: 

	If all repositories for an organization have already been connected to Azure Boards, you'll see the following message. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/message-all-repositories-already-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of message where no more repositories exist to connect."::: 

1. 	When asked, enter your GitHub credentials.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![GitHub sign in dialog](media/github/github-dialog-sign-in.png)  
	If you have enabled two-factor authentication, enter the authentication code that GitHub sent you and choose **Verify**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![GitHub two-factor authentication dialog](media/github/github-dialog-two-factor.png)  

	Otherwise, the system will automatically recognize your GitHub organization as your GitHub account has previously been associated with your Azure DevOps Services account. 

<a id="choose-repositories" /> 

### Choose the repositories 

Once you've been authenticated, you can select the repositories you want to connect. 

1. The **Add GitHub Repositories** dialog automatically displays and selects all GitHub.com repositories for which you're an administrator for the organization you selected. Unselect any repositories that you don't want to participate in the integration. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose your GitHub repositories.](media/github/add-github-repos.png)  

	> [!TIP]   
	> We recommend that you only connect a GitHub repo to projects defined in a single Azure DevOps organization. Connecting the same GitHub repo to projects defined in two or more Azure DevOps organizations can lead to unexpected **AB#** mention linking. For details, see [Troubleshoot GitHub & Azure Boards integration](troubleshoot-github-connection.md#integrate-repo-to-several-organizations). 

	If all repositories have been connected already to the current or other organization, then the following message displays. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/message-all-repositories-already-connected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of message where no more repositories exist to connect."::: 

1. When done, choose **Save**.


<a id="confirm-connection" /> 

### Confirm the connection 

In this step, you install the Azure Boards app for GitHub on the GitHub account or organization associated with the repositories you chose to connect to. 

1. Review the GitHub page that displays and then choose **Approve, Install, & Authorize**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Confirm your GitHub repositories](media/github/approve-install-auth-azure-boards-from-github.png)  

1. Provide your GitHub password to confirm.

1.	When done, you should see the new connection with the selected repositories listed.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![GitHub repositories connected](media/github/repos-list-s154.png)  

To change the configuration or manage the Azure Boards app for GitHub, see  [Change repository access to Azure Boards](change-azure-boards-app-github-repository-access.md).

## Add a GitHub connection using PAT   

We recommend that you use your GitHub account credentials to connect to your GitHub repository. However, if you need to use a PAT, do so by following these procedures. 

> [!TIP]  
> When creating your GitHub PAT, make sure that you include these scopes: `repo, read:user, user:email, admin:repo_hook`. 

1. To choose a PAT when connecting a GitHub repository, choose **Personal Access Token** when making a first-time connection. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/first-connection-pat.png" alt-text="First connection, choose Personal Access Token.":::

	Or, from the New GitHub connection dialog. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/connect-with-pat.png" alt-text="New GitHub connection dialog, choose Personal Access Token.":::

	To create a GitHub PAT, go to [GitHub Developer Settings>Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). 

1. Enter the PAT and choose **Connect**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

## Connect Azure DevOps Services to GitHub Enterprise Server

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To connect Azure DevOps Services to your GitHub Enterprise Server, your GitHub Enterprise Server must be sufficiently accessible from the Internet. Make sure Azure DNS can resolve your GitHub Enterprise Server name and your firewall allows access from Azure Data Center IP addresses. To determine the IP address range, see [Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653). A common error message encountered when connectivity issues exist is: 
> 
> *The remote name could not be resolved: 'github-enterprise-server.contoso.com'*
> 
> If you encounter this error, check that your server is accessible. For more information, see [Azure DNS FAQ](/azure/dns/dns-faq). 

1. From the **Project Settings>GitHub connections** page choose GitHub Enterprise Server, choose **GitHub Enterprise Server** when making a first-ptime connection. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/first-connection-enterprise.png" alt-text="First connection, choose GitHub Enterprise Server.":::

	Or, from the **New GitHub connection** dialog, choose **GitHub Enterprise Server**.

	:::image type="content" source="media/connect-cloud/connect-to-enterprise.png" alt-text="New GitHub connection dialog, choose GitHub Enterprise Server.":::
