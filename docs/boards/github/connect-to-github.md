[!INCLUDE[temp](../_shared/github-platform-support.md)]


## Prerequisites 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
* You must connect to an Azure Boards or Azure DevOps project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../../boards/get-started/sign-up-invite-teammates.md). 
* You must be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) and the project's [Contributors group](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). If you created the project, then you have permissions. 
* You must be an administrator or owner of the GitHub repository you'll be connecting to.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can connect to multiple repositories so long as you are an administrator for those repositories.

> [!TIP]   
> We recommend that you only connect a GitHub repo to projects defined in a single Azure DevOps organization. Connecting the same GitHub repo to projects defined in two or more Azure DevOps organizations can lead to unexpected AB# mention linking. For details, see [Troubleshoot GitHub & Azure Boards integration](troubleshoot-github-connection.md#integrate-repo-to-several-organizations).

## Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) 

We recommend that you use OAuth to connect to your GitHub repository. However, if you need to use a PAT, you can by following these procedures. 

> [!TIP]  
> When creating your GitHub PAT, make sure that you include these scopes: `repo, read:user, user:email, admin:repo_hook`. 

0. To choose a PAT when connecting a GitHub repository, choose ![plus icon ](../../_img/icons/blue-add.png) **New Connection** and then choose the **Click here** link. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Ad GitHub repository, choose personal access token](_img/github/add-github-connection-dialog-choose-pat.png)   

	To create a GitHub PAT, go to [GitHub Developer Settings>Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). 

0. Enter the PAT and choose **Connect**.

## Register Azure DevOps Server using OAuth

If you plan to use OAuth to connect Azure DevOps Server with your GitHub Enterprise Server, do that now. For details, see [Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

### Register application in GitHub 

0. Sign into the web portal for your GitHub Enterprise server.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Sign into GitHub Enterprise server](_img/github-ent/sign-in-to-ghe.png)  

0. Open **Settings>Developer settings>Oauth Apps** and choose **New OAuth App**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Sign into GitHub Enterprise server](_img/github-ent/ghe-settings-dev-oauth.png)  

0. Fill out the form to register your Azure DevOps Server application.  

	For the **Homepage URL**, specify the **Public URL** of your project collection. You can find this URL by [opening the Azure DevOps Administration Console](/azure/devops/server/admin/open-admin-console) and viewing the **Application Tier** node. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Azure DevOps Server Administration Console, Application Tier](_img/github-ent/app-tier-find-public-url.png)  

	For the **Authorization callback URL**, use the following pattern to construct the URL. 

	`{Azure DevOps Server Public Url}/{Collection Name}/ _admin/oauth2/callback`

	For example: 

	`http://contoso/DefaultCollection/_admin/oauth2/callback`

	Or, 

	`https://tfs.contoso.com/MyCollection/_admin/oauth2/callback`

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Register your Azure DevOps Server project](_img/github-ent/ghe-register-app.png)  

0. Choose **Register application**.

0. Upon success, you'll see a page that provides the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your registered OAuth application. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Sign into GitHub Enterprise server](_img/github-ent/ghe-register-app-success.png)  


### Register your OAuth configuration in Azure DevOps Server

0. Sign into the web portal for your Azure DevOps Server. 

0. Add the GitHub Enterprise Oauth configuration to your Azure DevOps Server collection. 

0. Open **Admin settings>Oauth configurations**, and choose **Add Oauth configuration**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Admin Settings>OAuth configurations](_img/github-ent/open-admin-settings-server-oauth-add.png)  

0. Fill in the form that appears, and then choose **Create**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![OAuth configuration dialog](_img/github-ent/add-oauth-configuration.png)

## Connect Azure DevOps Server to GitHub Enterprise Server

0. Choose the ![ ](/azure/devops/_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to open **Projects**, and then choose the Azure Boards project you want to configure to connect to your GitHub Enterprise repositories.

0. Choose (1) **Project Settings**, choose (2) **GitHub connections** and then (3) **Connect your GitHub Enterprise account**.   

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Project Settings>Integrations](_img/github-ent/open-project-settings-github-connections.png)   

	Or, choose a **personal access token** or **username and password**, if you are choosing to make your connection with those credentials.

	To create a PAT, see [Creating a personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

	> [!TIP]  
	> When creating your GitHub PAT, make sure that you include these scopes: `repo, admin:repo_hook, read:user, user:email`. 

	**Connect using OAuth**  

	Choose the configuration that you set up in step 1, and then choose **Connect**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![New GitHub Enterprise connection, OAuth dialog](_img/github-ent/new-github-ent-connect-oauth.png)  

	**Connect using a Personal Access Token**  

	Enter the URL for your GitHub Enterprise server and the **Personal access token** credentials recognized by that server. And then choose **Connect**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![GitHub sign in dialog](_img/github-ent/ads-add-ghe-pat.png)
