# Connect Azure Boards to GitHub  

[!INCLUDE[temp](../_shared/version-vsts-plus-azdevserver-2019.md)] 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

By connecting your Azure Boards project with GitHub.com repositories, you support linking between GitHub commits and pull requests to work items. You can use GitHub for software development while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work.  

> [!NOTE]   
> We recommend that you use the [Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md) to configure and manage your connections to GitHub.com. The app provides a more streamlined configuration experience and has the advantage of authenticating and operating as the app rather than an individual. Once you have configured your connection, you can manage the connected repositories either from Azure Boards or GitHub.com. 


When you make the connection from GitHub.com, the list of repositories correspond to ones that you allow the Azure Boards app to access. When you make the connection from Azure Boards, the list of repositories correspond to some or all of the repos from the first selection that you make to associate to a particular project. In the first instance, you can limit what the app can access overall, and limit what a particular project can access or split the management of work across different Azure Boards projects.

## Prerequisites 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
* You must connect to an Azure Boards or Azure DevOps project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../../boards/get-started/sign-up-invite-teammates.md). 
* You must be a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) and the project's [Contributors group](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). If you created the project, then you have permissions. 
* You must be an administrator or owner of the GitHub repository you'll be connecting to.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can connect to multiple GitHub repositories so long as you are an administrator for those repositories.

## Authentication options

Depending on the platform you work from to connect to GitHub, you have a choice of the credentials you use. The recommended authentication method in all instances is <strong>OAuth</strong>.

## Add a GitHub connection using OAuth 

0. Sign into Azure Boards. 

0. Choose (1) <strong>Project Settings</strong>, choose (2) <strong>GitHub connections</strong> and then (3) <strong>Connect your GitHub Account</strong>.   

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Project Settings>Integrations](_img/github/open-project-settings-github-connections.png)   

	If connecting using PAT, see [Add a GitHub connection using PAT](#github-pat).
	If connecting to a GitHub Enterprise Server, see [Register Azure DevOps in GitHub as an OAuth App](#server-github-ent-oauth-register).

0. Enter your GitHub account credentials. Choose an account for which you are an administrator for the repositories you want to connect to. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![GitHub sign in dialog](_img/github/github-dialog-sign-in.png)  

0. If you have enabled two-factor authentication, enter the authentication code that GitHub sent you and choose <strong>Verify</strong>. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![GitHub two-factor authentication dialog](_img/github/github-dialog-two-factor.png)  

0. Review the GitHub authorization dialog that appears which indicates the information you'll allow Azure Boards to access from GitHub. Choose <strong>Authorize AzureBoards</strong> when ready.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Project Settings>Integrations](_img/github/git-dialog-authorize-boards.png)  

0. In the Add GitHub repositories dialog, you'll see the list of repositories for which you are an administrator. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![List of GitHub repositories connected](_img/github/repos-list.png)   

> [!TIP]   
> We recommend that you only connect a GitHub repo to projects defined in a single Azure DevOps organization. Connecting the same GitHub repo to projects defined in two or more Azure DevOps organizations can lead to unexpected AB# mention linking. For details, see [Troubleshoot GitHub & Azure Boards integration](troubleshoot-github-connection.md#integrate-repo-to-several-organizations).

## Register Azure DevOps in GitHub as an OAuth App

If you plan to use OAuth to connect Azure DevOps Services or Azure DevOps Server with your GitHub Enterprise Server, you first need to register the application as an OAuth App. For details, see [Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

## Connect Azure DevOps Services to GitHub Enterprise Server

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To connect Azure DevOps Services to your GitHub Enterprise Server, your GitHub Enterprise Server must be sufficiently accessible from the Internet. Make sure Azure DNS can resolve your GitHub Enterprise Server name and your firewall allows access from Azure Data Center IP addresses. To determine the IP address range, see [Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP Ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41653). A common error message encountered when connectivity issues exist is: 
> 
> <em>The remote name could not be resolved: 'github-enterprise-server.contoso.com'</em>
> 
> If you encounter this error, check that your server is accessible. For more information, see [Azure DNS FAQ](/azure/dns/dns-faq). 


0. Choose the ![ ](/azure/devops/_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to open <strong>Projects</strong>, and then choose the Azure Boards project you want to configure to connect to your GitHub Enterprise repositories.

0. Choose (1) <strong>Project Settings</strong>, choose (2) <strong>GitHub connections</strong> and then (3) <strong>Click here</strong> to connect to your GitHub Enterprise organization.
