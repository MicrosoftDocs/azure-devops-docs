# Azure Boards-GitHub integration 

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Use this guide to connect Azure Boards with one or more GitHub repositories. This connection uses the Azure Boards app for GitHub to support the integration between Azure Boards and GitHub. This app is free for both public and private repositories. 

By connecting Azure Boards with GitHub repositories, you enable linking between GitHub commits, pull requests, and issues to work items. You can use GitHub for software development while using Azure Boards to plan and track your work. Azure Boards provides the scalability to grow as your organization and business needs grow.

## Supported integration scenarios 

Azure Boards and Azure DevOps Services support integration with GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. On-premises Azure DevOps Servers support integration with GitHub Enterprise Server repositories. 

> [!NOTE]   
> By installing the Azure DevOps Server 2020.1.1 Patch 2, you can create connections from your Azure DevOps Server to GitHub.com repositories in addition to GitHub Enterprise Server repositories.


Azure Boards-GitHub integration supports the following connections:  

- **From GitHub**: 
	- Support integration for all repositories for a GitHub account or organization, or select repositories. 
	- Add or remove GitHub repositories that participate in the integration and configure the project they connect to. 
	- Suspend Azure Boards-GitHub integration or uninstall the app.

- **From Azure Boards**: 
	- Connect one or more GitHub repositories to an Azure Boards project.
	- Add or remove GitHub repositories from a GitHub connection within an Azure Boards project. 
	- Completely remove a GitHub connection for a project.
	- Allow a GitHub repository to connect to one or more Azure Boards projects within the same Azure DevOps organization or collection. 

Azure Boards-GitHub integration supports the following operational tasks:  

- Create links between work items and GitHub commit, pull requests, and issues based on GitHub mentions 
- Support state transition of work items to a "Done" or "Completed" state when using GitHub mention by using `fix`, `fixes`, or `fixed` 
- Support full traceability by posting a discussion comment to GitHub when linking from a work item to a GitHub commit, pull requests, or issue 
- Show linked to GitHub code artifacts within the work item Development section
- Show linked to GitHub artifacts as annotations on Kanban board cards 
- Support status badges of Kanban board columns added to GitHub repositories.

The following tasks aren't supported at this time: 
- Query for work items with links to GitHub artifacts. However, you can query for work items with an `External Link Count > 0`. 
 

## Connect Azure Boards to GitHub repositories 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"
You can start from Azure Boards or from GitHub to make the connection. You can connect up to 250 GitHub repositories to an Azure Boards project.

> [!NOTE]   
> We recommend that you use the [Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md) to configure and manage your connections to GitHub.com. The app provides a more streamlined configuration experience and has the advantage of authenticating and operating as the app rather than an individual. Once you have configured your connection, you can manage the connected repositories either from Azure Boards or GitHub.com.
