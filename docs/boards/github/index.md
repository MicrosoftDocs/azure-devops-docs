To connect Azure Boards to GitHub.com, [connect and configure from Azure Boards](connect-to-github.md). Or, alternatively, [install and configure the Azure Boards app from GitHub](install-github-app.md). Both methods have been streamlined and support authenticating and operating via the app rather than an individual. 

To connect Azure Boards to a GitHub Enterprise Server, see  [connect from Azure Boards](connect-to-github.md). 

Once you've configured the connection, you can then exercise these features:
- [Link GitHub commits and pull requests to work items](link-to-from-github.md)
- [Configure status badges](configure-status-badges.md)
