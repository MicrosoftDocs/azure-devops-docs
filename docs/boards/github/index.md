> [!IMPORTANT]   
> We recommend that you use the [Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md) to configure and manage your connections to GitHub.com. The app provides a more streamlined configuration experience and has the advantage of authenticating and operating as the app rather than an individual. Once you're connected, you can manage the repositories either from Azure Boards or GitHub.com.

- [Change repository access to Azure Boards](install-github-app.md#change-repository-access) to change connections, suspend the integration, or uninstall the app.  

## Restrictions 

- Only connect a GitHub repository to one Azure DevOps organization and project.  
If you connect the same GitHub repo to projects defined in two or more Azure DevOps organizations, it can lead to unexpected **AB#** mention linking. For more information, see [Troubleshoot GitHub & Azure Boards integration](connect-to-github.md#resolve-connection-issues). 
- Azure DevOps can only integrate with GitHub repositories or Azure Repos Git repositories. Integration with other Git repositories isn't supported.
- You can't query for work items with links to GitHub artifacts. However, you can query for work items with an `External Link Count > 0`.
