   :::image type="content" source="media/github-ent/ads-add-ghe-user-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sign in with GitHub credentials."::: 

2. The dialog lists all repositories for which you have GitHub administration rights. You can toggle between **Mine** and **All** to determine if others appear, and then check the ones that you want to add. Choose **Save** when you're done.

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-ent/ads-add-ghe-repositories.png" alt-text="Screenshot of repositories to select to add."::: 

3. To connect to a GitHub account or organization from Azure Boards for the first time, you also install the Azure Boards app for GitHub. Complete the integration by following the procedures outlined in [Confirm the connection](connect-to-github.md#confirm-connection). 

## Resolve connection issues

The Azure Boards-GitHub integration relies on various authentication protocols to support the connection. Changes to a user's permission scope or authentication credentials can cause revocation of the GitHub repositories connected to Azure Boards. 
 
For an overview of the integration that the Azure Boards app for GitHub supports, see [Azure Boards-GitHub integration](index.md).  

#### Supported authentication options

The following authentication options are supported based on the GitHub platform you want to connect to.

#### Resolve access issues

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

When the Azure Boards connection to GitHub no longer has access, it shows an alert status in the user interface with a red-X. Hover over the alert and it indicates that the credentials are no longer valid. To correct the problem, remove the connection and recreate a new connection.

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"
When the Azure Boards connection to GitHub no longer has access, it shows an alert status in the user interface with a red-X that has a tooltip such as, *Unable to connect to GitHub*.
::: moniker-end

Consider the following resolutions:  

- **If the connection is using OAuth**:
  - The Azure Boards application had its access denied for one of the repositories.
  - GitHub might be unavailable/unreachable. This unavailability could be because of an outage in either service or an infrastructure/network issue on-premises. You can check service status from the following links:
      - [GitHub](https://status.github.com)  
      - [Azure DevOps](https://status.dev.azure.com/)

	Delete and recreate the connection to the GitHub repository. This recreated connection causes GitHub to prompt to reauthorize Azure Boards.   

- **If the connection is using a PAT:**
  - The PAT  was revoked or the required permission scopes changed and are insufficient.
  - The user perhaps lost administrative permissions on the GitHub repository.  

	Recreate the PAT and ensure the scope for the token includes the required permissions: `repo, read:user, user:email, admin:repo_hook`. For more information, see [Best practices for using PATs](../../organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate.md#best-practices-for-using-pats).

#### Update XML definitions for select work item types 

If your organization customizes work tracking using the Hosted XML or on-premises XML process model and wants to integrate GitHub link types into the Development section of work item forms, you must update the XML definitions for the corresponding work item types.

For example, to link user stories and bugs to GitHub commits and pull requests within the **Development** section of work item forms, you must update the XML definitions for these work item types.

To modify the XML definitions, do the steps outlined in [Hosted XML process model](../../organizations/settings/work/hosted-xml-process-model.md). For each work item type:
1. Locate the `Group Label="Development"` section.
2. To support the external link types, **GitHub Commit** and **GitHub Pull Request**, add the following lines of code:

This integration enables seamless tracking of GitHub activities directly from your work items in Azure Boards.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Pull Request" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Commit" />  
> ```

When it updates, the section should appear as follows. 

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <Group Label="Development">  
>    <Control Type="LinksControl" Name="Development">  
>       <LinksControlOptions ViewMode="Dynamic" ZeroDataExperience="Development" ShowCallToAction="true">  
>          <ListViewOptions GroupLinks="false">   
>          </ListViewOptions>  
>          <LinkFilters>  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Build" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Integrated in build" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Pull Request" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Branch" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Fixed in Commit" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Fixed in Changeset" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Source Code File" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Found in build" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Pull Request" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Commit" />  
>          </LinkFilters>  
>       </LinksControlOptions>  
>    </Control>  
> </Group>  
> ```
