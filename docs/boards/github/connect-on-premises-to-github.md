## Prerequisites 
 
* Connect to GitHub.com repositories by installing Azure DevOps Server 2020.1.1 Patch 2. Without this patch, you can only connect to your GitHub Enterprise Server repositories.
* [Install the Azure Boards app for GitHub](install-github-app.md) on the GitHub organizations or account. 
* Connect to an Azure Boards or Azure DevOps project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md). 
* You must be a member of the [**Project Collection Administrators** group](../../organizations/security/change-organization-collection-level-permissions.md) and the project's [Contributors group](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). If you created the project, then you have permissions. 
* You must be an administrator of the GitHub Enterprise Server that you connect to. 

## Authentication options

The following authentication options are supported. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2020"
- [PAT](#server-github-ent-pat)

   :::image type="content" source="media/github-ent/ads-add-ghe-repositories.png" alt-text="Screenshot of repositories to select to add."::: 

3. To connect to a GitHub account or organization from Azure Boards for the first time, you also install the Azure Boards app for GitHub. Complete the integration by following the procedures outlined in [Confirm the connection](connect-to-github.md#confirm-connection). 

## Resolve connection issues

The Azure Boards-GitHub integration relies on various authentication protocols to support the connection. Changes to a user's permission scope or authentication credentials can cause revocation of the GitHub repositories connected to Azure Boards. 
 
For an overview of the integration that the Azure Boards app for GitHub supports, see [Azure Boards-GitHub integration](index.md).  

#### Supported authentication options

The following authentication options are supported based on the GitHub platform you want to connect to.

#### Resolve access issues

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

When the Azure Boards connection to GitHub no longer has access, it shows an alert status in the user interface with a red-X. Hover over the alert and it indicates that the credentials are no longer valid. To correct the problem, remove the connection and recreate a new connection.

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"
When the Azure Boards connection to GitHub no longer has access, it shows an alert status in the user interface with a red-X that has a tooltip such as, *Unable to connect to GitHub*.
::: moniker-end

Consider the following resolutions:  

- **If the connection is using OAuth**:
  - The Azure Boards application had its access denied for one of the repositories.
  - GitHub might be unavailable/unreachable. This unavailability could be because of an outage in either service or an infrastructure/network issue on-premises. You can check service status from the following links:
      - [GitHub](https://status.github.com)  
      - [Azure DevOps](https://status.dev.azure.com/)

	Delete and recreate the connection to the GitHub repository. This recreated connection causes GitHub to prompt to reauthorize Azure Boards.   

- **If the connection is using a PAT:**
  - The PAT may have been revoked or the required permission scopes changed and are insufficient.
  - The user may have lost admin permissions on the GitHub repo.  

	Recreate the PAT and ensure the scope for the token includes the required permissions: `repo, read:user, user:email, admin:repo_hook`.

#### Update XML definitions for select work item types 

If your organization uses the Hosted XML or on-premises XML process model to customize the work tracking experience, and you want to link to and view the GitHub link types from the Development section in the work item forms, you must update the XML definitions for the work item types. 

For example, if you want to link user stories and bugs to GitHub commits and pull requests from the **Development** section, you need to update the XML definitions for user stories and bugs. 

Follow the sequence of tasks provided in [Hosted XML process model](../../organizations/settings/work/hosted-xml-process-model.md) to update the XML definitions. For each work item type, find the `Group Label="Development"` section, and add the following two lines in the following code syntax to support the external links types: **GitHub Commit** and **GitHub Pull Request**.  

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Pull Request" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Commit" />  
> ```

When it updates, the section should appear as follows. 

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <Group Label="Development">  
>    <Control Type="LinksControl" Name="Development">  
>       <LinksControlOptions ViewMode="Dynamic" ZeroDataExperience="Development" ShowCallToAction="true">  
>          <ListViewOptions GroupLinks="false">   
>          </ListViewOptions>  
>          <LinkFilters>  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Build" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Integrated in build" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Pull Request" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Branch" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Fixed in Commit" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Fixed in Changeset" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Source Code File" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="Found in build" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Pull Request" />  
>              <ExternalLinkFilter Type="GitHub Commit" />  
>          </LinkFilters>  
>       </LinksControlOptions>  
>    </Control>  
> </Group>  
> ```
