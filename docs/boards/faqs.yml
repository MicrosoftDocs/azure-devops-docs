sections:
  - name: Access and permissions
    questions:
      - question: Who can contribute to Azure Boards?
        answer: |
          Members of an Azure Boards project can use most features for tracking work. Some features require a specific access level or security group membership. More limits can come from work-tracking permissions or custom rules. For details, see [Default permissions and access for Azure Boards](get-started/permissions-access-boards.md).

      - question: How can noncontributors view or modify work items?
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="azure-devops"
          For private projects, assign Stakeholder access to grant view or limited-edit rights to an unlimited number of users. For public projects, anonymous users (people who don't sign in) can view all work items. For more information, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md) and [Make a private project public](../organizations/projects/make-project-public.md).
          If your organization uses Microsoft Entra ID, you can [add external users to your organization](../organizations/accounts/add-external-user.md).
          ::: moniker-end

          ::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
          You can grant access to an unlimited number of users by assigning Stakeholder access. To learn about Stakeholder capabilities, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md).
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: How can I restrict viewing or modifying selected work items?
        answer: |
          Use area path permissions to restrict who can view or modify work items. See:
          - [Set work tracking and plan permissions](../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json)
          - [Grant or restrict permissions to select tasks](../organizations/security/restrict-access.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json)

      - question: Can caching affect rules applied to work items?
        answer: |
          <a id="caching"></a>
          Yes. The browser caches conditional rules based on user or group membership. If you can't update a work item, you likely hit a cached rule. You can either wait for the client cache to expire (about three days) or clear it manually. To clear the cache, open the browser console and run:
          ```
          window.indexedDB.deleteDatabase("wit")
          ```
          Then refresh the page. For more information, see [Rules and rule evaluation](../organizations/settings/work/rule-reference.md).

      - question: What client tools support work tracking with Azure Boards?
        answer: |
          See [Tools and clients that connect to Azure DevOps](../user-guide/tools.md).

  - name: Work items
    questions:
      - question: Where should I start to learn about work items and work item types?
        answer: |
          See [About work items](work-items/about-work-items.md) for an introduction.

      - question: How do I view all work items?
        answer: |
          Open a query and add these clauses:
          - `Work Item Type = [Any]`
          - `State = [Any]`
          Then add filters as needed. For more, see [Create and save managed queries with the query editor](queries/using-queries.md).

      - question: Can a work item be assigned to several users or a user group?
        answer: |
          No. Each work item can be assigned to only one user. You can assign only users listed in the [people picker](queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#people-picker).

      - question: What's the recommended method to group work?
        answer: |
          Group work by assigning it to the same area path. Area paths help organize work by product, feature, or business area and let teams focus on items assigned to their areas. You can also group work under a parent work item using parent-child links (a hierarchical grouping). For guidance, see [Configuration and customization of Azure Boards, Area paths, product teams, and portfolio management](configure-customize.md#area-path).

      - question: How do I mark a task or work item as a milestone task?
        answer: |
          Azure Boards doesn't use milestone markers for individual work items (Delivery Plans supports milestones). To indicate a milestone, you can:
          - Add the word **Milestone** to the work item title
          - Add a **Milestone** tag ([Add tags to work items](queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md))
          - Add a custom field labeled **Milestone** with a pick list ([Customize process fields](../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md))
          - Link work items to a milestone item ([Link work items](backlogs/add-link.md))
          - Assign the milestone work item to the target sprint ([Assign work to a sprint](sprints/assign-work-sprint.md))

      - question: How can I best track dependencies?
        answer: |
          Link work items using Related, Predecessor/Successor, or other link types to track dependencies. See [Link work items to other objects](backlogs/add-link.md).

          ::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2022"
          Use [Delivery Plans](plans/review-team-plans.md) to visualize dependencies across teams.
          ::: moniker-end

          For cross-organization dependencies, consider the [Dependency Tracker extension](extensions/dependency-tracker.md).

      - question: What determines which work item type should be a parent for another work item type?
        answer: |
          Each process defines default backlog levels (for example: requirement, feature, epic). Work item types assigned to those backlog levels naturally form parent-child relationships. For more information, see [Organize your backlog, map child work items to parents](backlogs/organize-backlog.md). To customize backlogs, see [Customize your backlogs or boards, Edit or rename the requirement backlog](../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md).

      - question: How do I copy or clone a work item with all linked items?
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
          In the cloud service, you can copy a work item and choose to copy child work items. See [Copy or clone work items](backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone).
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: How do I bulk modify a rich-text field?
        answer: |
          See [Bulk modify work items, Bulk modify rich-text fields](backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md#rich-text).

  - name: Automation rules
    questions:
      - question: Is there a way to make the parent active when a child is active?
        answer: |
          Yes. Configure two backlog-level rules:
          1. Set the parent to Active when any child becomes Active.
          2. Set the parent to Resolved or Closed when all children are Closed.
          For details, see [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).

      - question: Why are my work items automatically changing state?
        answer: |
          Administrators can configure backlog rules that automatically update work item states. For details and examples, see [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).

      - question: Why don't rules trigger when I reactivate a child item?
        answer: |
          Rules trigger when a child moves from New to Active or into Closed. They don't trigger when a child moves from Closed back to Active; this behavior is by design.

      - question: Can I set automation rules per work item type or state?
        answer: |
          No. Rules apply to all work item types in a backlog level because rules use state categories (which are consistent across work item types).

      - question: Can I set up automation rules for user stories but not for features or epics?
        answer: |
          Yes. Configure rules per backlog level. A rule on the user stories backlog doesn't affect features or epics. You can also configure separate rules for features and epics. See [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).

      - question: Why are automation rules not working if the child or parent item belongs to a different team or project?
        answer: |
          Rules only trigger when both parent and child belong to the same team. This prevents rules from automatically affecting items owned by other teams. For details, see [Automate work item state transitions](work-items/automate-work-item-state-transitions.md).

  - name: Backlogs and boards
    questions:
      - question: What's the difference between a backlog and a board?
        answer: |
          Backlogs list work items; boards show those items as cards. Both use filters based on the team's area path and iteration path. For how the filtering works, see [About teams and Agile tools, Team defaults referenced by backlogs and boards](../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md#team-defaults-referenced-by-backlogs-and-boards).

      - question: How do I add a backlog or board?
        answer: |
          Add a team. Each team gets its own backlogs and boards and can customize them. See [About teams and Agile tools](../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

      - question: What limits should I be aware of?
        answer: |
          Azure DevOps enforces limits such as the number of work items shown on a backlog or board and limits on teams. For a full list, see [Work tracking, process, and project limits](../organizations/settings/work/object-limits.md).

      - question: How do I migrate my existing backlog to Azure Boards?
        answer: |
          See [Azure Boards migration and integration](extensions/migrate-integrate.md).

      - question: How do the three types of backlogs—product, portfolio, and sprint—differ?
        answer: |
          Each backlog shows work items filtered by the team's area and iteration paths and by work item type:
          - Product backlog: Lists user stories (Agile), issues (Basic), product backlog items and bugs (Scrum), or requirements (CMMI). Offers options to show **Parents**, **Forecast**, and child items.
          - Portfolio backlog: Lists Features (portfolio backlog) or Epics (epic backlog). Offers options to show **Parents** and child-item progress.
          - Sprint backlog: Shows product backlog items assigned to the selected iteration and includes **Work details** options.

      - question: Can I define sprints and use them with my board?
        answer: |
          Yes. Assign sprints to work items and filter your board by iteration path. See [Filter your board](./backlogs/filter-backlogs-boards-plans.md).

      - question: If I manage bugs with tasks, can I add bugs as a checklist to a requirement?
        answer: |
          No. Task checklists only support the Task work item type.

      - question: How do I create a view of the critical path?
        answer: |
          Azure DevOps doesn't provide a native critical-path view. We recommend using Delivery Plans to view dependencies and a calendar of work. For more advanced critical-path analysis, consider connecting Azure DevOps to Microsoft Project or exploring Marketplace extensions. See [Review team Delivery Plans](plans/review-team-plans.md) and the Marketplace search for relevant extensions.

  - name: Rollup
    questions:
      - question: How can I get a rollup of Story Points, Effort, or other work item fields?
        answer: |
          ::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
          Add rollup columns to a product or portfolio backlog to show progress bars or totals for numeric fields across descendant items in a hierarchy. Descendant items include all child items in the hierarchy. See [Display rollup progress or totals](backlogs/display-rollup.md).
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: Can I get a rollup of team capacity?
        answer: |
          No. Team capacity isn't stored in the regular work-tracking data stores, so you can't roll it up the same way you roll up numeric work item fields.

  - name: Boards
    questions:
      - question: Is there a way to widen columns on a board?
        answer: |
          No. Column width isn't configurable. To request this feature, upvote it on our [Developer Community page](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Resize-board-column-width/901212?space=21&q=column+width).

      - question: Can I query based on board columns?
        answer: |
          Yes. Use board-related fields to query column changes. See [Query by assignment or workflow changes, board change queries](queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#query-changes-to-a-kanban-board).

      - question: Can I view a query as a board?
        answer: |
          Yes. Install the [Query Based Boards](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=realdolmen.EdTro-AzureDevOps-Extensions-QueryBasedBoards-Public) Marketplace extension.

      - question: Is there a way to copy a board configuration to another team?
        answer: |
          Yes. Use the [Azure Boards Kanban Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alm-devops-rangers.KanbanBoardTools) Marketplace extension to copy board configuration across teams.

      - question: Can I list items based on their column assignment?
        answer: |
          Yes. Track column moves using the [Board Column and Board Column Done fields](queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#kanban_query_fields).

      - question: What if I get the error message, "The column configurations aren't valid"?
        answer: |
          This error usually means the workflow states for work item types in the **Requirement** category aren't mapped to columns. Select **Correct this now** in the error dialog to open Settings and map states to columns.

          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
          > ![Screenshot that shows a configuration error message on a board.](./backlogs/media/setup-backlog/column-config-error.png)

          After you map each state to an existing or new column, the board displays items assigned to those states.

          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
          > ![Screenshot showing board settings, columns.](./boards/media/add-columns-custom-states-mapping.png)

      - question: Can I use swimlanes and set up swimlane rules?
        answer: |
          Yes. You can add or remove swimlanes and configure swimlane rules to move work items automatically when conditions are met. For more information, see [Add or remove swimlanes and set up swimlane rules](boards/expedite-work.md#set-up-swimlane-rules).

  - name: Work item templates
    questions:
      - question: Where should I start to learn about work item templates?
        answer: |
          Define work item templates for teams you belong to. To create templates and set defaults for fields, see [Use templates to add and update work items](backlogs/work-item-template.md).

      - question: How do I set a default template for a team?
        answer: |
          The product doesn't support setting a default template for a team at this time.

      - question: Can I copy a work item template to another team or project?
        answer: |
          No. The product doesn't support copying templates between teams or projects.

      - question: Can I create a work item template that creates links to other work items?
        answer: |
          You can't create hierarchy templates that set a default parent. To create linked child items, consider using Excel to bulk add items and set parent-child links, or add child items from a board. See:
          - [Add task checklists](boards/add-task-checklists.md)
          - [Add, run, and update inline tests](boards/add-run-update-tests.md)
          - [Add features and epics](boards/kanban-epics-features-stories.md)

          ::: moniker range="<=azure-devops"
          If you need a quick solution, consider one of these Marketplace extensions:
          - [Work item form one-select actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)
          - [1-select Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)
          - [1-select Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks)
          ::: moniker-end

      - question: How do I delete a work item template?
        answer: |
          On the work item type page, open the actions menu ( :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: ) for the template you want to remove and choose **Delete**.

          > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
          > ![Delete template](backlogs/media/templates/delete-template.png)

  - name: GitHub integration
    questions:
      - question: How do I connect Azure Boards to GitHub?
        answer: |
          See [Azure Boards & GitHub](github/index.md).

      - question: Can I specify the status when linking a work item to a GitHub commit or PR?
        answer: |
          No. You can't set the work item status automatically when linking a commit or pull request.

  - name: Configuration and customizations
    questions:
      - question: What is configurable or customizable?
        answer: |
          You configure and customize Azure Boards at the project and team level. For an overview, see [Configuration and customization of Azure Boards](configure-customize.md#area-path).
