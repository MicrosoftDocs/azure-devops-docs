# Start using Azure Boards (Agile process) 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Use this guide to sign up and start using Azure Boards. 


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Select the version that meets your location and process**:
> We are experimenting with a new acquisition model which is 
> currently available for users located in the United States and that sign up through [azure.com/boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/boards/?nav=min). This model supports a new Basic process.  
> For International users and others who sign up through another method, the Agile process is used. Select your version of this article based on your location and process used.
> - [**Basic process**](index.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/get-started/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/get-started/breadcrumb/toc.json)  
> - [**Agile process**](index-agile.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/get-started-agile/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/get-started-agile/breadcrumb/toc.json)  

Start with [Sign up and invite some teammates](sign-up-invite-teammates-agile.md).

Then, read [Plan and track work](plan-track-work.md) to start adding and tracking issues on the Kanban board. To add columns, swimlanes, or fields to your board, see [Customize your boards](customize-boards.md). 

> [!NOTE]   
> This quickstart guide illustrates how to sign up, create a project based on the Agile process, and start tracking user-stories and tasks. If you want more information on working with other processes which offer other work item types, see [Choose a process](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md). 

If you are tasked with managing Azure Boards settings, review [Manage your Azure Boards project](manage-boards.md) for additional configurations and resources that you may want to make. 

If you use GitHub and want to track your issues in Azure Boards, see [GitHub & Azure Boards](../github/index.md).
