# What is Azure Boards?

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-vsts-plus-azdevserver-2019.md)]

With the Azure Boards web service, teams can manage their software projects. It provides a rich set of capabilities including native support for Scrum and Kanban, customizable dashboards, and integrated reporting. These tools can scale as your business grows. 
  
You can quickly and easily start tracking user stories, backlog items, task, features, and bugs associated with your project. You track work by adding work items based on the process and work item types available to your project. 

### Video: Plan your work with Azure Boards

> [!NOTE]  
> This article applies to Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions. Most of the guidance is valid for earlier on-premises versions. However, images show only examples for the latest versions. Also, the Basic process is only available with [Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2097609) and later versions. 


## Work item types 
 
Two of the most popular processes used are Basic and Agile. A process determines the work item types and workflow available in Azure Boards. If you want a project that uses the Scrum or CMMI process, you can [add another project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md) and specify the process. See [Choose a process for a comparison of processes](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/four-process-work-item-types-workflow.md)] 

Each work item represents an object stored in the work item data store. Each work item is assigned a unique identifier (ID) within your projects.

## Track work on interactive backlogs and boards

Quickly add and update the status of work using the Kanban board. You can also assign work to team members and tag with labels to support queries and filtering. Share information through descriptions, attachments, or links to network shared content. Prioritize work through drag-and-drop.  


#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

**Update the status of user stories**

Add and update the status of work from **New**, **Active**, **Resolved**, and **Closed** using the Kanban board. Add tasks as child items to user stories. To learn more, see [Track user stories, features, and tasks](plan-track-work.md).

## Collaborate

Collaborate with others through the **Discussion** section of the work item form. Use <strong>@mention</strong>s and **#ID** controls to quickly include others in the conversation or link to other work items. Choose to follow specific issues to get alerted when they are updated. 

Create dashboards that track status and trends of work being accomplished.  Set notifications to get alerted when an issue is created or changed.

## Work in sprints, implement Scrum

Plan sprints by assigning work to current or future sprints. Forecast work that can get completed based on effort estimates. Determine how much work can be done within a sprint. Bulk assign issues and tasks to team members and sprints.

## Work effectively

You'll find you can work more effectively through these actions: 

- Organize work into a hierarchy by grouping issues under epics, and tasks under issues.
- Create queries and quickly triage issues and tasks. 
- Create work item templates to help contributors quickly add meaningful issues and tasks.  
- Quickly find work items that are assigned to you. Pivot or filter your work items based on other criteria, such as work items that you follow, that you're mentioned in, or that you viewed or updated.

## Best tool for the job

Azure Boards provides the following interactive lists and signboards. Each tool provides a filtered set of work items. All tools support viewing and defining work items. To learn more about effective use of these tools, see [Best tool to add, update, and link work items](../work-items/best-tool-add-update-link-work-items.md).   

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

- [**Work items**](../work-items/view-add-work-items.md): Use to quickly find work items that are assigned to you. Pivot or filter work items based on other criteria, such as work items that you follow, that you're mentioned in, or that you viewed or updated.
- [**Boards**](../boards/kanban-quickstart.md): Boards present work items as cards and support quick status updates through drag-and-drop. The feature is similar to sticky notes on a physical whiteboard. Use to implement Kanban practices and visualize the flow of work for a team.
- [**Backlogs**](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md): Backlogs present work items as lists. A product backlog represents your project plan and a repository of all the information you need to track and share with your team. Portfolio backlogs allow you to group and organize your backlog into a hierarchy. Use to plan, prioritize, and organize work.  
- [**Sprints**](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md): Sprint backlogs and taskboards provide a filtered view of work items a team assigned to a specific iteration path, or sprint. From your backlog, you can assign work to an iteration path by using drag-and-drop. You can then view that work in a separate *sprint backlog*. Use to implement Scrum practices.
- [**Queries**](../queries/view-run-query.md): Queries are filtered lists of work items based on criteria that you define by using a query editor. You use queries to support the following tasks:
	- Find groups of work items with something in common.
	- List work items for the purposes of sharing with others or doing bulk updates. Triage a set of items to prioritize or assign.
	- Create status and trend charts that you then can add to dashboards.

## Support independent, autonomous teams 

A team refers to a group of project members who work in a particular product area. Those areas are represented as *area paths*. Area paths are hierarchical paths that denote the possible areas of ownership in an organization. A team is defined by a name, its members, and its area paths.

Boards, Backlogs, Sprints rely on team configurations. For example, if you want to add a Kanban board or product backlog, you define a team. For more information on teams, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).  

## Manage work across projects

Most work is tracked within a project. However, many enterprises create several projects to support their business needs as described in [Plan your organizational structure](../..//user-guide/plan-your-azure-devops-org-structure.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/breadcrumb/toc.json). 


To track work across several projects, you can: 
- [Create work item queries that list work items across projects](../queries/using-queries.md#across-projects)
- [Gain visibility across teams](../plans/visibility-across-teams.md)

## Get access to more tools 

Extensions provide support for additional tools. An extension is an installable software unit that adds new capabilities to your projects. Find extensions in the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops). Extensions can support planning and tracking of work items, sprints, scrums, and more and collaboration among team members.
