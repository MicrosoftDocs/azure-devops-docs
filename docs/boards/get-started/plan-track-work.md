# Plan and track work in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

In this article, learn how to use Azure Boards to plan and track your work using an *Agile*, *Basic*, *Scrum*, or *Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)* process. For more information, see [About processes and process templates](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).

[!INCLUDE [basic process](../includes/basic-process-note.md)]

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process)

The Agile process uses various work item types such as user stories, tasks, bugs, features, and epics to plan and track work. Begin by adding user stories and grouping them into features if needed. You can add tasks to a user story to track more details.

| Work item types | Backlog hierarchy |
|:------|:---------|

In each work item form, you can describe the work to be done, assign work to project contributors, track status, and collaborate with others through the **Discussion** section. This article describes how to add user stories and child tasks from the web portal and add details to those work items.

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process)

The Basic process offers three work item types for planning and tracking work: epics, issues, and tasks. To begin, add issues to track user stories, bugs, or feature items. For grouping, define epics. To track more details, add tasks to an issue.

In each work item form, describe work, assign contributors, track status, and collaborate in the **Discussion** section. This article describes how to add issues, child tasks, and work item details on the web portal.

#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

The Scrum process uses various work item types to plan and track work. Item types include product backlog items, tasks, bugs, features, and epics. Add product backlog items and group them into features if needed. Add child tasks to track more work details.  

| Work item types | Backlog hierarchy |

In each work item form, describe work, assign contributors, track status, and collaborate in the **Discussion** section. This article describes how to add product backlog items, child tasks, and work item details on the web portal.

#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process)

The CMMI process uses work item types such as requirements, tasks, bugs, features, and epics to plan and track work. Start by adding requirements and group them into features or epics if needed. Add child tasks to track more work details.

| Work item types | Backlog hierarchy |

## Update work status

The State field tracks the status of a work item. With the board, you can quickly update the status of backlog items by dragging and dropping them to a different column.

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process)

As work begins, drag the user story card from the **Backlog** column to the **Active** column. When work is ready for review, move it to the **Resolved** column. After a team member reviews and accepts it, move it to the **Closed** column.

:::image type="content" source="media/plan-track-work/update-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing updating status on board, Agile process.":::

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process)

As work begins, drag the issue from the **To Do** column to the **Doing** column. When a team member completes it, move it to the **Done** column.

:::image type="content" source="media/track-issues/update-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing updating status on board, Basic process.":::

#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

After a backlog item is approved to start work, drag the backlog item card from the **New** column to the **Approved** column. When work begins, drag the card to the **Committed** column. After work completes, move it to the **Done** column.

:::image type="content" source="media/plan-track-work/update-status-scrum.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing updating status on board, Scrum process.":::

#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 

As work begins, drag the requirement card from the **Backlog** column to the **Active** column. When work is ready for review, move it to the **Resolved** column. After a team member reviews and accepts it, move it to the **Closed** column.

:::image type="content" source="media/plan-track-work/update-status-cmmi.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing updating status on board, CMMI process.":::

> [!TIP]  
> To add or rename columns as needed, see [About configuring and customizing Azure Boards](../configure-customize.md).

## Add tasks

Task checklists provide a quick and easy way to track elements of work that are important to complete a backlog item. Also, you can assign individual tasks to different team members.

> [!TIP]
> Tasks that you create from the board are automatically assigned the **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** of their parent work item and show up on your sprint taskboard.

Tasks that you create from the [sprint backlog](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) or [taskboard](../sprints/task-board.md) show up in tasks checklists on the board.
