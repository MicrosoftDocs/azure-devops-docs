# Plan and track work in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

In this article, learn how to use Azure Boards to plan and track your work using an **Agile**, **Basic**, **Scrum**, or **Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)** process. For more information, see [About processes and process templates](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/basic-process-note.md)] 

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

The Agile process uses various work item types such as user stories, tasks, bugs, features, and epics to plan and track work. Begin by adding user stories and grouping them into features if needed. You can add tasks to a user story to track more details.

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Work item types| Backlog hierarchy |
> |------|---------|
> |![Agile process work item types, conceptual image.](media/about-boards/agile-process-wits.png) | ![Screenshot of Agile process Hierarchical backlog.](media/about-boards/agile-hierarchy.png) |

Within each work item form, you can describe the work to be done, assign work to project contributors, track status, and collaborate with others through the Discussion section. 

We show you how to add user stories and child tasks from the web portal and add details to those work items. 

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

The Basic process offers three work item types - epics, issues, and tasks - for planning and tracking work. Begin by adding issues to track user stories, bugs, or feature items. For grouping, define epics. To track more details, add tasks to an issue.

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Work item types| Backlog hierarchy |
> |------|---------|
> |![Basic process work item types, conceptual image.](media/about-boards/basic-process-epics-issues-tasks-2.png) | ![Screenshot of Basic process Hierarchical backlog.](media/about-boards/hierarchy-2.png) |

In each work item form, describe work, assign contributors, track status, and collaborate in the Discussion section. We show you how to add issues, child tasks, and work item details on the web portal.


#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

The Scrum process uses various work item types, including product backlog items, tasks, bugs, features, and epics, to plan and track work. Add product backlog items and group them into features if needed. Add child tasks to track more work details.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Work item types| Backlog hierarchy |
> |------|---------|
> |![Scrum work item types, conceptual image.](../work-items/guidance/media/ALM_PT_Scrum_WIT_Artifacts.png)  | ![Screenshot of Scrum process product backlog, show parents.](media/about-boards/scrum-hierarchy-simple.png)  |

In each work item form, describe work, assign contributors, track status, and collaborate in the Discussion section. We show you how to add product backlog items, child tasks, and work item details on the web portal.


#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 

The CMMI process uses work item types such as requirements, tasks, bugs, features, and epics to plan and track work. Start by adding requirements and group them into features or epics if needed. Add child tasks to track more work details.

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Work item types| Backlog hierarchy |
> |------|---------|
> |![CMMI work item types, conceptual image.](../work-items/guidance/media/ALM_PT_CMMI_WIT_Artifacts.png) | ![Screenshot of CMMI process Requirements backlog, show parents.](media/about-boards/cmmi-hierarchy-simple.png)  |

In each work item form, describe work, assign contributors, track status, and collaborate in the Discussion section. We show you how to add user stories, child tasks, and work item details on the web portal.

## Open your Kanban board 

A Kanban board is provisioned with the addition of each project and each team. You can only create or add Kanban boards to a project by adding another team. For more information, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{your_organization}```) and go to your project.
2. Select **Boards** > **Boards**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/plan-track-work/open-boards.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing two selections highlighted with red boxes, to open boards.":::

3. Select a board from the **All Team Boards** dropdown menu.

   :::image type="content" source="media/plan-track-work/select-from-all-team-boards-dropdown-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing All Team Boards to choose from, listed in the dropdown menu.":::

## Add work items to your board

Work items on your board are automatically assigned the default **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** assigned to the team. For more information, see [Configure team settings](../../organizations/settings/manage-teams.md). 

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

1. From the Stories board, choose **New item** and the stories you want to track. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Add new item, Kanban board, Agile process.](media/plan-track-work/new-user-story-kanban-board.png) 

1. Enter return and the system assigns a work item ID to the user story. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Added item, Agile process.](media/plan-track-work/users-stories-board-added-item.png) 

1. Add as many user stories as you need.  

> [!TIP]
> To quickly add features and child user stories, choose **Features** from the board selector. 
>:::image type="content" source="media/plan-track-work/choose-features-board.png" alt-text="Screenshot to Open the features board, Agile process.":::

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

1. From the Issues board, choose **New item** and add the issues you want to track. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

You can also choose the ![attachments icon](../media/icons/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png) **Attachments** tab and drag-and-drop a file to share the file with others.  

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

For example, here we assign the story to Raisa Pokrovskaya and add a discussion note, at-mentioning Raisa. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of User Story work item form.](media/plan-track-work/user-story-form-add-details.png)

Choose **Save & Close** when you're done.

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

For example, here we assign the issue to Raisa Pokrovskaya and add a discussion note, at-mentioning Raisa.

### Field descriptions

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/section-basic-field-descriptions.md)] 

## Update work status

The State field tracks the status of a work item. With the Kanban board, you can quickly update the status of backlog items by dragging and dropping them to a different column.

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

As work begins, drag the user story card from the **Backlog** column to the **Active** column. Once work is ready for review, move it to the **Resolved** column. After it's reviewed and accepted, move it to the **Closed** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing updating status on Kanban board, Agile process.](media/plan-track-work/update-status.png) 

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

As work begins, drag the issue from the **To Do** column to the **Doing** column. Once it's completed, move it to the **Done** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing updating status on Kanban board, Basic process.](media/track-issues/update-status.png) 

#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

Once a backlog item is approved to start work, drag the backlog item card from the **New** column to the **Approved** column.  When work begins, drag the card to the **Committed** column. Once work has completed, move it to the **Done** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing updating status on Kanban board, Scrum process.](media/plan-track-work/update-status-scrum.png) 

#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 

As work begins, drag the requirement card from the **Backlog** column to the **Active** column. Once work is ready for review, move it to the **Resolved** column. After it's reviewed and accepted, move it to the **Closed** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing updating status on Kanban board, CMMI process.](media/plan-track-work/update-status-cmmi.png) 

* * *

> [!TIP]  
> To add or rename columns as needed, see [Customize your board](../configure-customize.md). 

## Add tasks 

Task checklists provide a quick and easy way to track elements of work that are important to support completing a backlog item. Also, you can assign individual tasks to different team members. 

> [!TIP]   
> Tasks that you create from the Kanban board are automatically assigned the **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** of their parent work item and show up on your sprint taskboard. 

Tasks that you create from the [sprint backlog](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) or [taskboard](../sprints/task-board.md) show up within tasks checklists on the Kanban board.  

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

1. Select the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false":::  actions icon for the story and select ![plus icon](../../media/icons/green_plus_icon.png) **Add Task**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose Add Task from the User Story card menu, Agile process.](media/plan-track-work/add-child-task.png) 

	Enter a title for the task and select **Enter** when you're done.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Add first task, Agile process. ](media/plan-track-work/prep-images-task.png)
