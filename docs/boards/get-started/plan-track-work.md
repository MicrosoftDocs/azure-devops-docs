# Plan and track work  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-all.md)]

You track your work by creating work items. This article walks you through creating issues and tasks using a Kanban board for the Basic process, or creating user stories and tasks using for the Agile process. 

Choose one of the following four system processes&mdash;**Agile**, **Basic**, **Scrum**, or **Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)**&mdash;for guidance depending on what process was selected for your project. For an overview of each of these processes, see [Choose a process](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/basic-process-note.md)] 


#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

The Agile process provides several work item types&mdash;for example, user stories, tasks, bugs, features, and epics among others&mdash;to plan and track work. We recommend you start by adding user stories. If you need to group them into a hierarchy, you can define features. If you want to track additional details of work, you can add tasks to a user story.

> |Work item types| Backlog hierarchy |
> |------|---------|
> |![Agile process work item types, conceptual image.](media/about-boards/agile-process-wits.png) | ![Screenshot of Agile process Hierarchical backlog.](media/about-boards/agile-hierarchy.png) |

Within each work item form, you can describe the work to be done, assign work to project contributors, track status, and collaborate with others through the Discussion section. 

Here we show how to add user stories and child tasks from the web portal and add details to those work items . 

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

The Basic process provides three work item types&mdash;epics, issues, and tasks&mdash;to plan and track work. We recommend you start by adding issues to track your user stories, bugs, or feature items. If you need to group them into a hierarchy, you can define epics. If you want to track additional details of work, you can add tasks to an issue.

Within each work item form, you can describe the work to be done, assign work to project contributors, track status, and collaborate with others through the Discussion section. 

Here we show how to add issues and child tasks from the web portal and add details to those work items . 


#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

The Scrum process provides several work item types&mdash;for example, product backlog items, tasks, bugs, features, and epics among others&mdash;to plan and track work. We recommend you start by adding product backlog items. If you need to group them into a hierarchy, you can define features. If you want to track additional details of work, you can add tasks child items to a product backlog item.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Work item types| Backlog hierarchy |
> |------|---------|

Within each work item form, you can describe the work to be done, assign work to project contributors, track status, and collaborate with others through the Discussion section. 

Here we show how to add product backlog items and child tasks from the web portal and add details to those work items. 


#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 

The CMMI process provides several work item types&mdash;for example, requirements, tasks, bugs, features, and epics among others&mdash;to plan and track work. We recommend you start by adding requirements. If you need to group them into a hierarchy, you can define features and epics. If you want to track additional details of work, you can add tasks child items to a requirement.  

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Work item types| Backlog hierarchy |
> |------|---------|
> |![CMMI work item types, conceptual image.](../work-items/guidance/media/ALM_PT_CMMI_WIT_Artifacts.png) | ![Screenshot of CMMI process Requirements backlog, show parents.](media/about-boards/cmmi-hierarchy-simple.png)  |

## Open the Kanban board 

A Kanban board is provisioned with the addition of each project and each team. You can only create or add Kanban boards to a project by adding another team. To learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

The User Stories Kanban board is the best tool for quickly adding user stories and child tasks. To open, choose **Boards>Boards**.  

![Screenshot of Open your Kanban board, Agile process.](media/plan-track-work/open-kanban-board-user-stories.png)  

The Features Kanban board is the best tool for quickly adding features and user stories that are children of those features. 
To open the Features board from the Stories board, choose **Features** from the board selector. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot to Open the features board, Agile process.](media/plan-track-work/choose-features-board.png)  

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

The Issues Kanban board is the best tool for quickly adding issues and child tasks. To open, choose **Boards>Boards**.  
![Screenshot of Open your Kanban board, Basic process.](media/track-issues/open-kanban-board-issues.png)  

The Epics Kanban board is the best tool for quickly adding epics and issues that are children of those epics. 
To open the Epics board from the Issues board, choose **Epics** from the board selector. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot to Open the Epics board, Basic process.](media/track-issues/choose-epics-board.png)  

#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

The Backlog items Kanban board is the best tool for quickly adding product backlog items and child tasks. To open, choose **Boards>Boards**.  

![Screenshot of Open your Kanban board, Scrum process.](media/plan-track-work/open-kanban-board-scrum-items.png)  

The Features Kanban board is the best tool for quickly adding features and product backlog items that are children of those features. 
To open the Features board from the Backlog items board, choose **Features** from the board selector. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot to Open the Features board, Scrum process.](media/plan-track-work/choose-features-board-scrum.png)  

The default Scrum process configuration doesn't enable the Epic backlog level for a team. To enable it, see [Select backlog navigation levels for your team](../../organizations/settings/select-backlog-navigation-levels.md).

#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 

The Requirements Kanban board is the best tool for quickly adding requirements and child tasks. To open, choose **Boards>Boards**.

### Field descriptions


[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/section-basic-field-descriptions.md)] 


## Update status

The State field tracks the status of a work item. With the Kanban board, you can quickly update the status of backlog items by dragging and dropping them to a different column. This feature requires that you have Basic access or higher.  

#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

As work starts, drag the user story card from the **Backlog** column to the **Active** column. Once work is ready for review, move to the **Resolved** column. After it is reviewed and accepted, move to the **Closed** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Update status on Kanban board, Agile process.](media/plan-track-work/update-status.png) 

You can add or rename columns as needed, see [Customize your board](customize-boards.md).

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

As work starts, drag the issue from the **To Do** column to the **Doing** column. Once completed, move to the **Done** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Update status on Kanban board, Basic process.](media/track-issues/update-status.png) 

You can add or rename columns as needed, see [Customize your board](customize-boards.md).

#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

Once a backlog item is approved to start work, drag the backlog item card from the **New** column to the **Approved** column.  When work actually starts, drag the card to the **Committed** column. Once work has completed, move to the **Done** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Update status on Kanban board, Scrum process.](media/plan-track-work/update-status-scrum.png) 


#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 


As work starts, drag the requirement card from the **Backlog** column to the **Active** column. Once work is ready for review, move to the **Resolved** column. After it is reviewed and accepted, move to the **Closed** column. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Update status on Kanban board, CMMI process.](media/plan-track-work/update-status-cmmi.png) 


* * *

> [!TIP]  
> You can add or rename columns as needed, see [Customize your board](customize-boards.md). 


## Add tasks 

Task checklists provide a quick and easy way to track elements of work which are important to support completing a backlog item. In addition, you can assign individual tasks to different team members. 

> [!TIP]   
> Tasks that you create from the Kanban board are automatically assigned to the sprint/iteration path of the parent work item under which you define them. 

Tasks that you create from the Kanban board show up on your sprint taskboard. Also, tasks that you create from the [sprint backlog](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) or [taskboard](../sprints/task-board.md) show up within tasks checklists on the Kanban board.
