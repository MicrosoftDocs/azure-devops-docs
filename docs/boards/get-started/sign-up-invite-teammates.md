# Sign up for free and invite others to collaborate in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

Sign up for an Azure DevOps and Azure Boards to start planning and tracking work. We walk you through the sign-up process for [Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards/?nav=min). Follow these steps when you want to accomplish the following tasks: 
- Create a private or public project with Azure Boards enabled services  
- Track work using the Basic, Agile, Scrum, or CMMI process for tracking work  
- Create a Git or Team Foundation Version control (TFVC) repository for managing your code 
- Invite others to contribute to your project 
 
To sign up and enable all Azure DevOps Services, see [Sign up, sign in to Azure DevOps](../../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md). To learn more about the choices available to you, see these articles: 
-  [What is Azure Boards?](./what-is-azure-boards.md) 
-  [Choose a process work tracking work](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md)
-  [Choose the right version control for your project](../../repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc.md). 

## Choose your sign-up option  

1. From your web browser, open the [Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards/) sign-up page. Supported web browsers include the latest versions of Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari (Mac), Firefox, and Chrome. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Create new project dialog, start free.](media/acquisition/start-free-azure-boards.png)

1. Choose one of the following buttons based on the account you want to use. 

	- **Start free**: Choose this option when: 
		- You have a Microsoft account and will sign in using your account email address, phone number, or Skype ID. If you're a Visual Studio subscriber and you get Azure DevOps as a benefit, use the Microsoft account associated with your subscription. Go to [Sign up with a personal Microsoft account](#MicrosoftAccount)
		- You want to sign up using a general email address you want to use. Continue to [Sign up by creating an account using your email address](#create-account).  
		> [!TIP]  
		> You can sign up with any valid email address. Signing up for Azure Boards enables your email address as a Microsoft account.  
	- **Start free with GitHub**: Choose this option if you have an  existing GitHub account. Then go to [Sign up with a GitHub account](#github-account).  
 

1. If you've already signed up or have an organization set up to use Azure Boards, choose the **Sign in** link.

> [!NOTE]   
> Your  project was created using the Basic process which uses Epics, Issues, and Tasks to track work. If you want a project that uses the Agile, Scrum, or CMMI process, then you can add another project and specify the process through advanced setting options as described in the next section.
