# Sign up for free and invite others to collaborate on your project

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Sign up for an Azure DevOps organization and Azure Boards to begin planning and tracking work. This sequence walks you through the sign-up process for users located in the United States and that sign up through [azure.com/boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards/?nav=min). In the end, you'll have a project the uses the [Basic process for work tracking](what-is-azure-boards-basic-process.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Select the version that meets your location and process**:
> We are experimenting with a new acquisition model which is 
> currently available for users located in the United States and that sign up through [azure.com/boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards/?nav=min). This model supports a new Basic process.  
> For International users and others who sign up through another method, the Agile process is used. Select your version of this article based on your location and process used.

> Your first project was created using the Basic process which uses Epics, Issues, and Tasks to track work. If you want a project that uses the Agile, Scrum, or CMMI process, then you can [add another project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md) and specify the process through advanced setting options. See [Choose a process for a comparison of processes](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md).
