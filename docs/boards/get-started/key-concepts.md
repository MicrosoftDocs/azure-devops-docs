# Key concepts and terms used for Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Here are definitions of key concepts and artifacts used in Azure Boards. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Select the version that meets your location and process**:
> We are experimenting with a new acquisition model which is 
> currently available for users located in the United States and that sign up through [azure.com/boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/boards/?nav=min). This model supports a new Basic process.  
> For International users and others who sign up through another method, the Agile process is used. Select your version of this article based on your location and process used.

## Agile methods
The goal of Agile engineering best processes is to rapidly deliver high-quality software. Agile uses a business approach that aligns development with customer needs and company goals. Frequent inspection and adaptation are necessary. Teamwork, self-organization, and accountability are critical to project success.  

## Agile tools
This suite of web-based tools is used to track work and support Agile methodologies. Agile tools support Scrum and Kanban, the core Agile methods that are used by software development teams today. To learn more, see [What is Azure Boards?](what-is-azure-boards.md).

## Bug
A bug is a type of work item that records a potential source of dissatisfaction with the product. Bug is the common name of a work item type that's used to track code defects.

## Field 
Fields are used to track a piece of information about the work to perform. Values you assign to a field are stored in the work-tracking data store. You can use the data store to query and generate charts to view status and trends. To look up the definition of each predefined field, see [Index to basic field descriptions](../work-items/guidance/basic-field-reference.md). 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/glossary-terms/follow.md)] 

## Inheritance process model 
Inheritance process models are used to customize Azure Boards work and issue tracking. Projects inherit the customizations made to a process. To learn more, see [Inheritance process model](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md).

## Issue (Basic process) 
An issue is a type of work item that defines some work or code defect that needs to be tracked. It is defined for the Basic process and appears on the product backlog and [Issues Kanban board](track-issues-tasks.md). (Issues and impediments for other processes track other types of work as described in [Manage issues and impediments](../backlogs/manage-issues-impediments.md)).

## Kanban board 
A Kanban board is an interactive, electronic signboard that supports visualization of the flow of work from concept to completion and lean methods. To learn more, see [Kanban basics](../boards/kanban-quickstart.md).

## Pick list

A picklist specifies an enumerated set of values that appear within a drop-down menu in a work item form. Values also appear in the **Value** column within the query editor. The method you use to customize a picklist varies. It depends on the field and the process model. To learn more, see [Customize work](../../reference/customize-work.md).

## User story
A user story is a type of work item that defines the applications, requirements, and elements that teams plan to create. Product owners typically define and stack rank user stories. A user story is defined with the Agile process. To learn more, see [Agile process work item types and workflow](../work-items/guidance/agile-process-workflow.md).

## Workflow 

A workflow is an integral aspect of a work item. It's defined by its corresponding work item type. The workflow determines the logical progression and regression of work items. It tracks the status of work as the work progresses from a new or active state to a closed or completed state. For the Basic process, all work item types use the **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done** states to track workflow status. 

 The workflow also specifies the values that appear in the State and Reason drop-down menus. To learn more, see [Workflow states and state categories](../work-items/workflow-and-state-categories.md).
