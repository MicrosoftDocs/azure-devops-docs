# List work item fields and attributes

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
Work item fields are used to track information within Azure DevOps. These fields are defined at the organization level and are shared across all projects in the organization. To review the fields defined for your organization, you can use one of the following two tools, available for both Inherited and Hosted XML process models:

- [Process > Fields web page](#review-fields)
- [Work Item Field Explorer](#wi-explorer)
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=" < azure-devops"
Work item fields are used to track information within Azure DevOps. These fields are defined at the collection level and shared across all projects within that collection. To review the fields defined for your collection, use one of the following tools:

- [Process > Fields web page](#review-fields): Available for the **Inherited** process model.
- [Work Item Field Explorer](#wi-explorer): Available for both **Inherited** and **On-premises XML** process models. 
::: moniker-end

For a description of each field defined with a system process, see [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md).  

## Prerequisites 

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Permissions** | To view the fields defined for an organization or collection: Member of the **Project Collection Valid Users** application group or **View instance-level information** permission set to **Allow** for the organization or collection. |

<a id="list-fields"></a> 

### List or review fields  

To list or review fields, use one of the following tools based on your process model—**Inherited**, **Hosted XML**, or **On-premises XML**. For an index of fields defined within the default processes, see [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md). 

| Tool | Inheritance | Hosted XML | On-premises XML |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Web portal: List inherited and custom-defined fields](#review-fields) | ✔️  | ✔️1 |     |
| [Work item field explorer](#wi-explorer) | ✔️  | ✔️  | ✔️  |
| [witadmin listfields command line tool](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md) | ✔️  | ✔️  | ✔️  |
 
> [!NOTE]  
> 1. Only supported for default processes (Agile, CMMI, Scrum). 

## Field data types and names 

Each work item type specifies the fields included in work items of that type. Each field has multiple attributes, many of which are system-defined and immutable.

Fields get defined by the following three attributes:

- **Data type**: Indicates the kind of data that can be entered into the field, such as Boolean, Double, Integer, HTML, or String. For detailed descriptions of each data type, see [Query fields, operators, and macros](../queries/query-operators-variables.md#field-values).
- **Friendly name**: The user-friendly name assigned to the field, used when selecting a **Field** in a query clause. This name might differ from the name displayed on the work item form.
- **Reference name**: The identifier used when creating [WIQL queries](../queries/wiql-syntax.md), [improvised work item templates](../backlogs/work-item-template.md), executing [REST API commands](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/), or defining [XML work item type definitions](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/xml/field-definition-element-reference). The reference name is permanent and can't be changed once set.

For a detailed description of each field attribute and instructions on how to list them, see [Field attributes](#field-attributes) and [List field attributes](#list-attributes) later in this article. For an overview of work item types (WITs) and work items, refer to [Track work with user stories, issues, bugs, features, and epics](about-work-items.md).

### What is a field? How are field names used?  

Each [work item type](../backlogs/add-work-items.md) includes 31 system fields and several type-specific fields. Work items are used to plan and track your project.

Each field captures specific information about the work to be performed. The values you assign to these fields are stored in the work tracking data store, enabling you to create queries that determine status and trends.

For descriptions and usage of each field defined for the core system processes—[Agile, Basic, Scrum, and CMMI](guidance/choose-process.md)—refer to the [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md).

### Field names  

A work item field name uniquely identifies each work item field. Ensure your field names adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Uniqueness**: Field names must be unique within the account or project collection.
- **Length**: Field names must contain 128 Unicode characters or fewer.
- **Spacing**: Field names can't have leading or trailing spaces or contain two or more consecutive spaces.
- **Composition**: Field names must include at least one alphabetic character.
- **Prohibited Characters**: Field names can't include the following characters: `.,;'`:~/*|?"&%$!+=()[]{}<>`.

Since custom fields are defined at the organization or collection level, you can't add a custom field with the same name to multiple processes.

For more information, see [Naming restrictions and conventions](../../organizations/settings/naming-restrictions.md#work-items-work-item-types-and-customizations).

### System and predefined fields

A work item field name uniquely identifies each field within Azure DevOps. Ensure your field names comply with the following guidelines:

- **Uniqueness**: Field names must be unique within an account or project collection.
- **Length**: Field names must be 128 Unicode characters or fewer.
- **Spacing**: Field names can't have leading or trailing spaces or contain multiple consecutive spaces.
- **Composition**: Field names must include at least one alphabetic character.
- **Prohibited Characters**: Field names can't include the following characters: `.,;'`:~/*|?"&%$!+=()[]{}<>`.

Since custom fields are defined at the organization or collection level, you can't add a custom field with the same name to multiple processes.

For more information, see [Naming restrictions and conventions](../../organizations/settings/naming-restrictions.md#work-items-work-item-types-and-customizations).

### Custom fields 

Because custom fields are defined at the organization or project collection level, you can't add a custom field with the same name to multiple processes.

When adding custom fields, note the following limits:
- **Maximum fields per work item type (WIT):** 64
- **Maximum fields per process:** 512

The field data type determines the kind and size of data that can be stored in the field. Each field can have only one type defined within a project collection, encouraging the use of common fields across different projects and work item types.

When you add a custom field to an inherited process, Azure DevOps assigns a reference name prefixed with *Custom* followed by the field name without spaces. For example, adding a field named *DevOps Triage* results in the reference name **Custom.DevOpsTriage**. Spaces aren't allowed in reference names.

For more information, see [Naming restrictions and conventions](../../organizations/settings/naming-restrictions.md#work-items-work-item-types-and-customizations).

## How can I determine the field data type? 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can view the data type of fields defined for your organization by [opening the Process>Fields page](#review-fields).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Organization Settings, Process, Fields page.](media/fields/list-fields.png)  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=" < azure-devops"

When your project collection uses the **Inheritance** process model to customize work tracking, you can view the data type of fields by [opening the Process > Fields page](../work-items/work-item-fields.md#review-fields).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Screenshot of Collection Settings, Process, Fields page.](media/fields/list-fields.png)

If your project collection uses the **On-premises XML** process model, you can determine the data type through the [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md). Alternatively, you can:

- Open the **Work Item Field Explorer** to review defined fields and their attributes.
- Use the **witadmin listfields** command to list field attributes.

For more information, see [Work Item Field Explorer](#wi-explorer) and [List field attributes](#list-attributes) later in this article.

## Review fields list 

To review the list of fields defined for an organization or collection, do the following steps: 

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/project-icon.png" border="false"::: Azure DevOps logo to open **Projects**. Then choose **Organization settings**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of Choose Organization settings.](../../media/settings/open-admin-settings-vert.png)  

2. Select **Process**. 
   
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of Choose Process.](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/media/process/open-process-page-s150.png)

3. Select **Fields**. 

	Fields listed correspond to all fields defined for the organization or collection, which includes all custom fields and the fields defined for system processes. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of Make a copy of a selected inherited process.](media/fields/list-fields.png) 

	> [!NOTE]  
	> If you don't see **Fields**, then your collection uses the On-premises XML process. The Fields page isn't supported for that process.  

	For descriptions, usage, and reference names of each field, refer to the [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md). Additionally, you can retrieve field reference names using the [Work Item Types Field - List REST API](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work-item-types-field/list).

<a id="wi-explorer"></a>

## Work Item Field Explorer 

You can look up the assignments of field attributes using the Work Item Field Explorer tool.  

![Screenshot of Work item field explorer.](media/fields/work-item-field-explorer.png)

To access the Work Item Field Explorer, install the Process Editor Tool. Based on your installed version of Visual Studio, get the Process Editor Tool from one of the following extensions. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/process-editor-tool.md)]

<a id="field-attributes"></a>

## Field attributes

There are many nonchangeable and hidden attributes for each work item field. The following table describes each attribute. Attributes have different names depending on whether you retrieve them through the [**Fields - Get REST API**](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/fields/get) or view them through the [Work Item Field Explorer (**WIFE**) tool](#wi-explorer).

Attributes assigned to a field depend on the platform and version you're using. For example, some attributes aren't supported with the Inheritance process. To look up the reference name for a field, see the [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> 1. For on-premises deployments, you can enable indexing for a field to improve query response times when filtering on the field. For more information, see [Indexed fields](#index-fields) later in this article. 
> 2. The **isPicklist** and **isPicklistSuggested** attributes are only assigned to custom fields defined for an inherited process. The Inherited process model is supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions. For more information, see [Inherited process model](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md).
> 3. All reporting attributes are valid only for on-premises deployments whose projects have been configured to support SQL Server Reporting and SQL Server Analysis Services.

## Reportable attributes

All reporting attributes are valid only for on-premises deployments where projects are configured to support SQL Server Reporting and SQL Server Analysis Services. For more information, see [Add reports to a project](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project).

For descriptions of each reportable attribute, refer to [Add or modify work item fields to support reporting](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/xml/add-or-modify-work-item-fields-to-support-reporting).

To see a list of fields with reportable attributes defined by default, see [Reportable fields reference](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/xml/reportable-fields-reference).

::: moniker-end

<a id="index-fields"></a>

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2022"

## Indexed fields

Use the **witadmin indexfield** command to enable or disable indexing for a work item field. Enabling indexing for a field can improve the performance of queries that specify that field. By default, the following fields are indexed:

- Assigned To
- Created Date
- Changed By
- State
- Reason
- Area ID
- Iteration ID
- Work Item Type

If you add a custom field used frequently in your work item queries, consider enabling indexing for that field. For more information, see [Manage work item fields (witadmin)](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md).

You can list the attributes assigned to a field by using the [**Fields - Get REST API**](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/fields/get). Replace *OrganizationName* with your actual organization name.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```REST
> https://dev.azure.com/OrganizationName/_apis/wit/fields/FieldReferenceName
> ```

For example, to list the attributes for the Iteration Path, use the reference name `System.IterationPath` for the `fabrikam` organization:

```REST
https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam/_apis/wit/fields/System.IterationPath

**Returned data:**

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```JSON
> {
> "name": "Iteration Path",
> "referenceName": "System.IterationPath",
> "description": "The iteration within which this bug will be fixed",
> "type": "treePath",
> "usage": "workItem",
> "readOnly": false,
> "canSortBy": true,
> "isQueryable": true,
> "supportedOperations": [
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.Under",
> "name": "Under"
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.NotUnder",
> "name": "Not Under"
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.Equals",
> "name": "="
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.NotEquals",
> "name": "<>"
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.In",
> "name": "In"
> },
> {
> "name": "Not In"
> }
> ],
> "isIdentity": false,
> "isPicklist": false,
> "isPicklistSuggested": false,
> "url": "https://dev.azure.com/mseng/_apis/wit/fields/System.IterationPath"
> }
> ```

You can list the attributes assigned to a field by using the [**Fields - Get** REST API](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/fields/get/?view=vsts-rest-tfs-4.1&preserve-view=true). Enter your organization name for *OrganizationName*. To get started using REST, see [Azure DevOps Services REST API Reference](/rest/api/azure/devops)

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```REST
> https://{ServerName:Port}/tfs/{Collection}/_apis/wit/fields/FieldReferenceName?api-version={version}
> ```

For example, here we list the attributes for the Iteration Path, specifying the reference name, `System.IterationPath`, for the fabrikam server. 

```REST
https://fabrikam:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/wit/fields/System.IterationPath?api-version=4.1
```

**Returned data:**

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```JSON
> {
> "name": "Iteration Path",
> "referenceName": "System.IterationPath",
> "description": "The iteration within which this bug will be fixed",
> "type": "treePath",
> "usage": "workItem",
> "readOnly": false,
> "canSortBy": true,
> "isQueryable": true,
> "supportedOperations": [
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.Under",
> "name": "Under"
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.NotUnder",
> "name": "Not Under"
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.Equals",
> "name": "="
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.NotEquals",
> "name": "<>"
> },
> {
> "referenceName": "SupportedOperations.In",
> "name": "In"
> },
> {
> "name": "Not In"
> }
> ],
> "isIdentity": false,

### List attributes using `witadmin` command-line tool

You can list select field attributes&mdash;such as the data type, reportable attributes, and indexing&mdash;using the [**witadmin listfields** command](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md). 

For example, you can enter the following command to list the attributes defined for a specified field, such as Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Issue.  
  
> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```CMD
> witadmin listfields /collection:http://fabrikam:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /n:Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Issue  
> ```  

Field and attribute information appears for the named field, as shown in this example.  

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```CMD
> Field: Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Issue  
> Name: Issue  
> Type: String  
> Reportable As: dimension  
> Use: Adventure Works (Shared Steps), AW Future (Shared Steps), AW Current (Shared Steps)  
> Indexed: False  
> ```  

The **Use** parameter indicates the name of each project and the work item type where the field is used.

## Add and modify fields   

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  

To add fields to a process, you add them to one or more work item types. For more information, see [Customize an inheritance process](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md). 

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=" < azure-devops"

You can add or modify the fields contained within a WIT or add a custom WIT. For more information, see:
- For project collections that use the Inheritance process model: [Customize an inheritance process](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md).  
- For project collections that use the On-premises XML process model: [Customize the On-premises XML process model](../../reference/on-premises-xml-process-model.md). 

You can change the field name, the index, and the report attributes for any field except system fields by using the **witadmin** command-line tool. For more information, see [Manage work item fields-witadmin](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md).
