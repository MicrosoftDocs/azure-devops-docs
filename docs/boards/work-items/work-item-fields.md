# Work item fields and attributes

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Work item fields are used to track information. Each work item type (WIT) definition specifies the fields defined for that WIT. Each field is associated with a number of attributes, many of which are set by the system and cannot be changed. 

Each field is defined by the following three attributes. 
- **Data type**: Specifies the type of data that can be entered into the field, such as Boolean, Double, Integer, HTML, and String. For descriptions of each data type, see [Query fields, operators, and macros](../queries/query-operators-variables.md#field-values). 
- **Friendly name**: Specifies the name assigned to the field and that you select for a **Field** in a query clause. This name may differ from that displayed on the work item form. 
- **Reference name**: Specifies the name that you use when creating [WIQL query](../queries/wiql-syntax.md) or an [ad hoc work item template](../backlogs/work-item-template.md), using [REST API commands](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/), or defining [XML work item type definitions](../../reference/xml/field-definition-element-reference.md). Once defined, the reference name cannot be changed.  
 
For a description of each field attribute and how you can list them, see [Field attributes](#field-attributes) and [List field attributes](#list-attributes) later in this article. For an overview of WITs and work items, see [Track work with user stories, issues, bugs, features, and epics](about-work-items.md). 

## Field names

The field friendly name identifies each work item field. When adding a custom field, make sure the friendly name falls within these guidelines:  

- Must be unique within the organization or project collection  
- Must be 128 or fewer Unicode characters  
- Can't contain any leading or trailing spaces, nor two or more consecutive spaces  
- Must contain at least one alphabetic character  
- Can't contain the following characters: ```.,;'`:~\/\*|?"&%$!+=()[]{}<>```.   

For additional information, see [Naming restrictions and conventions](../../organizations/settings/naming-restrictions.md#work-items-work-item-types-and-customizations).


### System and predefined fields

All system defined fields have reference names that begin with *System*, for example, System.AreaPath, System.AssignedTo, and continue in that pattern.

Predefined fields defined by the default process begin with Microsoft.VSTS and then further differ based on their usage. Examples of predefined fields that are used in common, for scheduling purposes and integration with Office Project, for integration with Team Foundation Build, and integration with test case management (TCM) are as follows:

-   Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority  
-   Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.DueDate  
-   Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn   
-   Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.Steps  

For an overview of all system and predefined fields that are defined for the default processes/process templates, see [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md). For more information about specifying field names, see [Naming restrictions](../../organizations/settings/naming-restrictions.md).

### Custom fields 

Because custom fields are defined for an organization or project collection, you can't add a custom field to a process with the same field name that you add to another process.  

When adding custom fields, note the following limits:  
*   A maximum of 256 fields can be defined for each WIT  
*   A maximum of 512 fields can be defined per process   

The field data type determines the kind and size of data that you can store in the field. A field can have only one type defined within a project collection. This restriction encourages organizations to use common fields across projects and work item types.


::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

When you add a custom field to an inherited process, Azure DevOps assigns a reference name based on the process name and the name of the field. For example, you add a field named Triage to the My Agile process, the reference name is **MyAgile.Triage**. No spaces are allowed within the reference name.  

::: moniker-end


## How can I determine the field data type? 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can view the data type of fields defined for your organization by [opening the Process>Fields page](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md#review-fields).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Process>Fields page](../../organizations/settings/work/_img/process/list-fields.png)  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azure-devops-2019"
When your project collection uses the Inheritance process model to customize work tracking, you can view the data type of fields by [opening the Process>Fields page](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md#review-fields). 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Process>Fields page](../../organizations/settings/work/_img/process/list-fields.png)  

If the On-premises XML process model is used, you can look up the data type through the [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md). Or, you can open the Work Item Field Explorer to review the fields defined and their attribute assignments, or use the **witadmin listfields** command to list the field attributes. For details, see [Work Item Field Explorer](#wi-explorer) and [List field attributes](#list-attributes) later in this article.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018" 
You can look up the data type through the [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md). Or, you can open the Work Item Field Explorer to review the fields defined and their attribute assignments, or use the **witadmin listfields** command to list the field attributes.  For details, see [Work Item Field Explorer](#wi-explorer) and [List field attributes](#list-attributes) later in this article.

## Field attributes

There are a number of non-changeable and virtually hidden attributes for each work item field. 
The following table describes each attribute.  

> [!NOTE]   
> The attribute listed in the first column of the table is supported through the [**Fields - Get** REST API](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/fields/get) and [**Work Item Types Field** - Get](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work%20item%20types%20field/get) commands. The attribute listed in the second column is supported through the Work Item Field Explorer (WIFE) tool, and the [FieldDefinition Properties](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/bb172008(v%3dvs.120)). The attributes assigned to a field depend on the platform and version you use.

**Notes:**

1. For on-premises deployments, you can enable indexing for a field to improve query response times when filtering on the field. For more information, see [Indexed fields](#index-fields) later in this article. 
2. The **isPicklist** and **isPicklistSuggested** attributes are only assigned to custom fields defined for an inherited process. The Inherited process model is only supported for Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019. 
3. All reporting attributes are valid only for on-premises deployments whose projects have been configured to support SQL Server Reporting and SQL Server Analysis Services.

## Reportable attributes

All reporting attributes are valid only for on-premises deployments whose projects have been configured to support SQL Server Reporting and SQL Server Analysis Services. For details, see [Add reports to a project](../../report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project.md).

For a description of each reportable attribute, see [Add or modify work item fields to support reporting](../../reference/xml/add-or-modify-work-item-fields-to-support-reporting.md). 

For a list of fields that have reportable attributes defined by default, see [Reportable fields reference](../../reference/xml/reportable-fields-reference.md).


<a id="index-fields" />

## Indexed fields

You can enable or disable indexing for a work item field by using the **witadmin indexfield** command. When you enable indexing for a field, you may increase the performance of finding work items whose queries specify that field. By default, the following fields are indexed: Assigned To, Created Date, Changed By, State, Reason, Area ID, Iteration ID, and Work Item Type. 

If you add a custom field that you use in many of your work item queries, you may want to enable indexing for that field. For more information, see [Manage work item fields (witadmin)](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md).

::: moniker-end


<a id="list-attributes" />


## List field attributes 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  

You can list the attributes assigned to a field by using the [**Fields - Get** REST API](/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/fields/get). Enter your organization name for *OrganizationName*.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```REST
> https://dev.azure.com/OrganizationName/_apis/wit/fields/FieldReferenceName
> ```

For example, here we list the attributes for the Iteration Path, specifying the reference name, `System.IterationPath`, for the fabrikam organization. 

```REST
https://dev.azure.com/fabrikam/_apis/wit/fields/System.IterationPath
```

**Returned data:**

### List attributes using witadmin command line tool

You can list select field attributes&mdash;such as the data type, reportable attributes, and indexing&mdash;using the [**witadmin listfields** command](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md). 

For example, you can enter the following command to list the attributes defined for a specified field, such as Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Issue.  
  
> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```CMD
> witadmin listfields /collection:http://fabrikam:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /n:Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Issue  
> ```  

Field and attribute information appears for the named field, as shown in this example.  

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```CMD
> Field: Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Issue  
> Name: Issue  
> Type: String  
> Reportable As: dimension  
> Use: Adventure Works (Shared Steps), AW Future (Shared Steps), AW Current (Shared Steps)  
> Indexed: False  
> ```  

The **Use** parameter indicates the name of each project and the work item type where the field is used.
