# Best tool to add, update, and link work items in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

Azure Boards provides you several tools&mdash;many designed to support a single task and others that support several tasks. This article provides a guide to the best tool for specific tasks that will help you work most efficiently. 


## Work item form 

If you want to make a single update to one work item, you can make an update from within the work item form. When you want to add or update several work items at a time, then you'll want to use a backlog or query. 

[Work item form controls](work-item-form-controls.md) | [Work item field index](guidance/work-item-field.md)

**Best tool for**: 
- [Updating a work item field for a single work item](../backlogs/add-work-items.md)  
- [Adding to the discussion, mentioning others in the discussion](view-add-work-items.md#capture-comments-in-the-discussion-section)
- [Choosing to follow or unfollow a work item](follow-work-items.md) 
- [Driving Git development, creating a branch](../backlogs/connect-work-items-to-git-dev-ops.md)
- [Adding a link to another work item or external object](../backlogs/add-link.md) 
- [Copying or cloning a work item](../backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md) 
- [Deleting the work item](../backlogs/remove-delete-work-items.md#delete-work-items) 

**Additional supported tasks**: 

- [Share information](../queries/share-plans.md)
- [Copy the work item URL](../backlogs/copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-the-url)
- [Capturing the work item to use as a template](../backlogs/work-item-template.md#capture)
- [Updating fields of the work item by applying an existing template](../backlogs/work-item-template.md#apply) 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 

## Work Items  

Use the [Work Items](view-add-work-items.md) page to quickly focus on work items of interest to you. 

**Best tool for**: 
- Listing and filtering work items of interest to you, specifically work items that meet the following criteria: 
	- That are assigned to you
	- That you chose to follow
	- Where you were mentioned
	- That you've recently viewed or updated
	- That has been recently updated, completed, or created for the project. 

#### Other supported tasks: 

- [Add a work item](view-add-work-items.md)  
- [Restore work items from the recycle bin](../backlogs/remove-delete-work-items.md#restore-work-items)  
- [View work items through a mobile browser](../..//project/navigation/mobile-work.md)

## Boards 

The two types of Kanban boards, product backlog and portfolio backlogs, provide the quickest means for adding user stories and portfolio work item types. You can also quickly add and update the status of child items within a hierarchy. As shown in the following image for the Agile process, when you add tasks to user stories, users stories to features, or features to epics, you automatically create parent-child links between the work items.

## Sprint tools

Sprint tools provide teams a focused view of work items they've assigned to a specific sprint. You can add tasks to work items and prioritize your sprint backlog.

## Test tools, test artifacts, and bugs

Testing tools used several work item types&mdash;such as test plans, test suites, test cases, and more. You create and manage them from **Test Plans/Test** or using one or more test tools. Several of these tools also support creating bugs.
