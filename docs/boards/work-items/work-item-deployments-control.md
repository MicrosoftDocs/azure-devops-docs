# Link work items to deployments

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

The release deployments control shows release information for those work items that have been associated to a commit which is part of a build being released. To learn how to associate work items to commits, see [Drive Git development from a work item](../backlogs/connect-work-items-to-git-dev-ops.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> The release deployments control currently works with classic release pipelines and with Azure DevOps Services (cloud) only. If your project is customized using a Hosted XML process, you need to update your work item type definitions to display the control. For details, see [Hosted XML process model, Add release deployment support to a work item type](../../organizations/settings/work/hosted-xml-process-model.md#add-support-wit).

## Configure release

First thing you must do is configure the release definition to post deployment information back to Azure Boards. 

1. Open Release definition, Options and Integrations

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Release Settings](_img/deployments-control/release-settings-1.png)

2. Select the "Preview: Report deployment status to Boards" option and configure the stages and deployment types

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Release Settings Stages](_img/deployments-control/release-settings-stages-1.png)

## Deployment control

Once the release has been configured to send deployment information to Azure Boards, and you have work items associated to the commits in the build, you can now go to the work item and see the status of the release. In the below example we have multiple environments that the release is targeting.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Release Settings Stages](_img/deployments-control/releases-stages-1.png)

When opening the work item, you can see the stages the release is being deployed, in real time.

> ![Release Settings Stages](_img/deployments-control/deployments-control-1.png)
