# Manage work item attachments

Attachments enhance work items by enabling you to share essential information with your team. You can attach files, images, and links directly to work items, facilitating better collaboration and documentation. Each work item can include up to **100 attachments**, with each file limited to **60 MB**. This article provides guidance on managing attachments within Azure DevOps.

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Permissions** | - To view, follow, and edit work items: **View work items in this node** and **Edit work items in this node** permissions set to **Allow**. By default, the **Contributors** group has these permissions. For more information, see [Set work tracking permissions](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md). <br> - To add tags to work items: Project-level **Create new tag definition** permission set to **Allow**. By default, the **Contributors** group has this permission. |
| **Access levels** | - [Project member](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). <br> - To add new tags to work items or to view or follow pull requests: At least [**Basic** access](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md). <br> - To view or follow work items: At least **Stakeholder** access. For more information, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md). <br> - All project members, including those in the **Readers** group, can send emails containing work items. |
|**Permanent deletion permissions**| To permanently delete attachments: **Permanently delete work items** permission set to **Allow**.|

## Manage attachments through the web portal

Do the following steps to manage attachments through the web portal:

2. Use the **Collapse/Expand** button to toggle the visibility of attachments.

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-work-items/expand-collapse-attachments.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing highlighted expand or collapse attachments button in work item." :::

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-work-items/attachments-list-grid-view-buttons-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing list and grid view buttons." :::

4. After you [add an attachment](#add-attachment), hover over the work item to access the **more actions** ![More Actions Icon](../media/icons/more-actions.png) menu. This menu allows you to do the following tasks:
   - **Preview** the attachment
   - [**Add** and **Edit** a comment](#add-and-edit-comment)
   - [**Copy** an attachment link](#copy-attachment-link)
   - [**Download** an attachment](#download-attachment)
   - [**Delete** attachments](#delete-attachment)
   - [**Permanently Delete** an attachment](#permanently-delete-attachment)
### Tips

- **Bulk management**: To manage multiple attachments simultaneously, consider using bulk actions available in the **Attachments** tab.
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to add, edit, or delete attachments. Project administrators typically have full access, while other roles might have limited permissions.
- **File size and type**: Be mindful of the attachment size limits (up to **60 MB** per file) and ensure that the file types you upload are supported by Azure DevOps.
