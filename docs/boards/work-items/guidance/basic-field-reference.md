# Index of system or basic work item fields in Azure Boards 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Use this index to look up a description of a field used to track an issue, task, or epic. This reference includes all fields defined for the Basic process. If you use another process&mdash;such as Agile, CMMI, or Scrum&mdash;see [Work item field index](work-item-field.md) for more field definitions.
 
[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/basic-process-note.md)] 

To support other tracking needs, you can [define your own custom work item fields](../../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process.md).
