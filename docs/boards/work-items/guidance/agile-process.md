# Agile process work item types 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

The Agile process supports the following work item types (WITs) to plan and track work, tests, feedback, and code review. With different WITs you can track different types of work&mdash;such as features, user stories, and tasks. These artifacts are created when you create a project using the Agile  process. They're based on Agile principles and values.  
 
![Conceptual image, Agile process work item types.](media/agile-process-work-tracking-wits.png)

Along with the WITs, teams have access to a set of work item queries to track information, analyze progress, and make decisions.

## Plan and track work with Agile
 
You build your project plan by creating a backlog of user stories that represent the work you want to develop and ship. You track bugs, tasks, and blocking issues using the bug, task, and issue WITs. To support portfolio management, teams create features and epics to view a roll up of user stories within or across teams. For details about using Agile WITs, see [Agile process work item types and workflow](agile-process-workflow.md).

## List work items by using queries

You can manage your workload more effectively by frequently reviewing the status of user stories and tasks. You can use the shared work item queries to list work items for a current sprint or the product backlog.

## Monitor progress  

All processes&mdash;Agile, Scrum, and CMMI&mdash;support [building status and trend charts and dashboards](../../../report/dashboards/overview.md). Also, several charts are automatically built based on the Agile tools you use. These charts display within the web portal.

## SQL Server reports

If your project collection and the project are configured with SQL Server Analysis Services and Reporting Services, you'll have access to many Agile reports. For these reports to be useful, [teams must complete certain activities,](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/review-team-activities-for-useful-reports) such as define build processes, link work items, and update status or remaining work.  

If you need to add reporting services or update reports to the latest versions, see [Add reports to a project](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project).

### Agile process versions  

As updates are made to the Agile process template, the version number is updated. The following table provides a mapping of the versioning applied as updates are made to the Azure DevOps on-premises process templates. For Azure Boards, the latest version is always used. Each template provides a `version` element. This element specifies a major and minor version. 

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |On-premises version | Agile process name | Major version |
> |-------------|-------------------|--------------|
> | Azure DevOps Services<br/>Azure DevOps Server 2022 | Agile | 18 |
> | Azure DevOps Server 2020<br/>Azure DevOps Server 2019 | Agile | 17 |
> | TFS 2018 | Agile | 16 |


For a summary of updates made to process templates, see [Changes made to process templates](changes-to-process-templates.md).

### Agile process predefined queries 

#### Product backlog and feedback queries

Product owners can use the shared queries that are defined in the following table to plan and track user stories that compose the product backlog.

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Shared query
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Description
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Product Backlog
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Provides a tree list of all user stories that are in a New, Active or Resolved state and sorts them by rank.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Product Planning
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Provides a flat list of all user stories that are not in a Removed state, and have not been closed in the last 90 days.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   Feedback
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   Lists all feedback responses that are in an Active state.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

#### Iteration planning queries

The following table describes the shared queries that are listed under the **Current Iteration** folder. These queries find work items that are assigned to a specified iteration. As you plan more iterations, you can modify these queries to specify a different iteration and then save them to other folders that you create, such as **Iteration 2** or **Iteration 3**.

The project administrator for each project [defines area and iteration paths](../../../organizations/settings/set-area-paths.md) for that project so that the team can track progress by those designations.

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Shared query**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   **Description**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!TIP]
> Queries listed under the **Current Iteration** folder do not automatically update when a new iteration becomes current. The current iteration is based on the dates that you [assign to your sprint schedules](../../sprints/define-sprints.md). You must manually update the iteration path of each query to have it point to the iteration path that corresponds to the current iteration. Or, you can edit the shared query to [use the **@CurrentIteration** macro](../../queries/query-by-date-or-current-iteration.md).  



#### Find tasks with summary values

The **Work Items With Summary Values** shared query, which is located in the **Troubleshooting** folder, lists all tasks that have child tasks and that contain non-zero values in the Remaining Work or Completed Work fields. This query is designed to find tasks that report work effort that is already accounted for in their child tasks. For the hours to be counted only once, summary tasks shouldn't be assigned any hours. For more information, see [Address inaccuracies published for summary values](../../../report/sql-reports/address-inaccuracies-published-for-summary-values.md).
