# Change request  field reference (CMMI)

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You can track change requests for CMMI work items by using these six fields: Justification, Impact on Architecture, Impact on User Experience, Impact on Test, Impact on Development, and Impact on Technical Publications. A description and a reference name for each of the change request fields are provided in the following table. When you open a work item form for a change request, the **Justification** field appears on the **Justification** tab, and all other fields appear on the **Analysis** tab.  
  
 The Change Request work item type is provided only with the [CMMI process](../cmmi-process.md).  
  
 None of these fields are reportable or indexed. They all have a data type of HTML.
