# Engineering processing areas in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

The Engineering section of the MSF for CMMI Process Improvement guidance covers the value-added activities. These activities are for discovering the information that is required to design and build software products. The Engineering grouping of process areas in the CMMI includes:

* Requirements Development
* Requirements Management
* Technical Solution
* Product Integration
* Verification
* Validation

All of these areas are model level 2 or 3 process areas.  
  

- **Vision and Requirements:** Capture the product vision and requirements  
	- [Develop requirements](guidance-develop-requirements.md)
	- [Arrange requirements into a product plan](arrange-requirements-into-a-product-plan.md)  
- **Architecture:** Define or capture the architecture of your solution.  
	- [Create a solution architecture](guidance-create-solution-architecture.md)   
- **Develop:** Implement and build your solution.  
	- [Implement development tasks](guidance-implement-development-tasks.md)  
	- [Building a product](guidance-build-product.md)
- **Verify and Validate:** Verify your solution.
	- [Track bugs](track-bugs.md)
