## Choose a Basic, Agile, Scrum, and CMMI process

The default processes differ mainly in the work item types (WITs) they provide for planning and tracking work. 

Basic is the most lightweight and is in a selective Preview. 
Scrum is the next most lightweight. Agile supports many Agile method terms, and CMMI, which stands for Capability Maturity Model Integration, provides the most support for formal processes and change management. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/note-basic-process.md)]

Choose the process that provides the best fit for your team.  

:::row:::
   :::column span="2":::
   
   **Basic**

   Choose [Basic](../../get-started/plan-track-work.md) when your team wants the simplest model that uses Issues, Tasks, and Epics to track work. 

 Tasks support tracking Remaining Work.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="2":::
   
   **Agile**

   Choose [Agile](agile-process.md) when your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum,
   and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and
(optionally) bugs on the Kanban board, or track bugs and tasks on the taskboard.  

   You can learn more about Agile methodologies at the
   [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/).
   
 Tasks support tracking Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="2":::
   
   **Scrum**

   
   Choose [Scrum](scrum-process.md) when your team practices Scrum. This process works great if you want to track product backlog items (PBIs) and
   bugs on the Kanban board, or break down PBIs and bugs into tasks on the taskboard.
   
   This process supports the Scrum methodology as defined by the [Scrum organization](https://www.scrum.org/).

   Tasks support tracking remaining work only.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row::: 
   :::column span="2":::
   
   **CMMI**

   Choose [CMMI](cmmi-process.md) when your team follows more formal project methods
   that require a framework for process improvement and an auditable record of decisions. With this process,
   you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.
   
   
   This process supports [formal change management activities](./cmmi/guidance-background-to-cmmi.md).
   Tasks support tracking Original Estimate, Remaining Work, and Completed Work.

If you need more than two or three backlog levels, you can add more based on the process model you use: 
- **Inheritance**: [Customize your backlogs or boards for a process](../../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)  
- **Hosted XML or On-premises XML**: [Add portfolio backlogs](../../../reference/add-portfolio-backlogs.md).  
	
<a id="main-distinctions"></a>

## Main distinctions among the default processes

The default processes are designed to meet the needs of most teams. 
If your team has unusual needs and connects to an on-premises server, 
you can customize a process and then create the project. 
Or, you can create a project from a process and then customize the project.  

The following table summarizes the main distinctions between the WITs and states used by the four default processes.

> [!NOTE]  
> 1. You can add these WITs from the [product backlog](../../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md) or [Kanban board](../../boards/kanban-basics.md). The product backlog shows a single view of the current backlog of work that can be dynamically re-ordered and grouped. Product owners can quickly prioritize work and outline dependencies and relationships.  
> Also, each team can configure how they want [bugs to show up on their backlogs and boards](../../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md).  
> 2. With portfolio backlogs you can define a hierarchy of backlogs to understand the scope of work across several teams and see how that work rolls up into broader initiatives. Each team can configure which [portfolio backlogs appear for their use](../../../organizations/settings/select-backlog-navigation-levels.md).  
> 3. You can define tasks from the [sprint backlog and taskboard](../../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md). 
With capacity planning, teams can quickly determine if they are over or under capacity for a sprint.

### Workflow states, transitions, and reasons

Workflow states support tracking the status of work as it moves from a new state to a closed or a done state. Each workflow consists of a set of states, the valid transitions between the states, and the reasons for transitioning the work item to the selected state.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevOps Server 2019, the default workflow transitions support any state to any state transition. You can customize these workflows to restrict some transitions .See [Customize work tracking objects to support your team's processes](../../../reference/customize-work.md).  
> 
> Also, you can view the supported workflow transitions for each work item type by installing the [State Model Visualization](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=taavi-koosaar.StateModelVisualization) Markeplace extension. This extension adds a new hub under Boards labeled **State Visualizer**. On that page you can choose a work item type and view the workflow state model.  

The following diagrams show the typical forward progression of 
those WITs used to track work and code defects for the three default processes. 
They also show some of the regressions to former states and transitions to removed states. 
Each image shows only the default reason associated with the transition.

Most WITs used by Agile tools, ones that appear on backlogs and boards, support any-to-any transitions. You can update the status of a work item using the Kanban board or the taskboard by dragging it to its corresponding state column.

You can change the workflow to support other states, transitions, and reasons. To learn more, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../../../reference/customize-work.md).


<a id="removed-closed-done"></a>

### Removed, Closed, and Done states  

When you change the state of a work item to Removed, Closed, or Done, the system responds like this: 

*   **Closed** or **Done**: Work items in this state don't appear on the portfolio backlog and backlog pages. However, they do appear on the sprint backlog pages, Kanban board, and taskboard. Also, when you change the portfolio backlog view to show backlog items, for example, to view Features to Product Backlog Items, work items in the closed and done state appear.   
*   **Removed**: Work items in this state don't appear on any backlog or board.   

Work items are maintained in a project as long as the project is active. 
Even if you set them to Closed, Done, or Removed, a record is kept in the data store. 
You can use a record to create queries or reports.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/note-closed-items.md)]

If you need to permanently delete work items, see [Remove or delete work items](../../backlogs/remove-delete-work-items.md).


<a id="wits-all"></a>

## Work item types added to all processes 

The following WITs are added to all processes except the Basic process.  

  ![Work item types used by Test Plans, Microsoft Test Managers, My Work, and Feedback](media/ALM_PT_WITS_shared.png)

Teams create and work with these types using the corresponding tool: 

*   Test Plan, Test Suite, Test Case Shared Steps, and Shared Parameters: Microsoft Test Manager.
*   Feedback Request and Feedback Response: Request feedback.  
*   Code Review Request and Code Review Response: My Work (from Team Explorer) and Code Review Request.  

Work items from these type definitions aren't meant to be created manually and are then added to the Hidden Types category. 
Work item types added to the Hidden Types category don't appear in the menus that create new work items.   

<a id="test-experience"></a>

### WITs that support the test experience  

WITs that support the test experience and work with Test Manager and the web portal are linked together using the link types shown in the following picture. 

![Test management work item types](media/ALM_PT_WITS_TestExperience.png)

From the web portal or Microsoft Test Manager, you can view which test cases are defined for a test suite. And you can view which test suites are defined for a test plan. 
However, these objects aren't connected to each other through link types. 
Customize these WITs as you would any other WIT. 
See [Customize work tracking objects to support your team's processes](../../../reference/customize-work.md). 

If you change the workflow for the test plan and test suite, you might need to update the process configuration as described here. For definitions of each test field, see [Query based on build and test integration fields](../../queries/build-test-integration.md).
