# CMMI process work item types and workflow in Azure Boards


[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Teams use the work item types (WITs) provided with the MSF for CMMI Process Improvement 2015 (CMMI) process to plan and track progress of software projects. Teams define requirements to manage the backlog of work and then, using the Kanban board, track progress by updating the status of requirements.
 
![CMMI process work item types, conceptual image](media/cmmi-process-plan-wits.png)

To gain insight into a portfolio of requirements, product owners can map requirements to features. When teams work in iterations, they define tasks that automatically link to requirements.

Using Microsoft Test Manager and the web portal, testers create and run test cases and define bugs to track code defects.

To support other CMMI processes, teams can track change requests, risks, issues, and notes captured in review meetings. If you're new to the CMMI process, review the section [Plan and track work with CMMI](cmmi-process.md#start-using) to get started. 

  
 

## Define requirements 

Create requirements from the quick add panel on the [product backlog page](../../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md). 

<img src="media/cmmi-quick-add-panel.png" alt="CMMI process, Quick add panel on the requirements backlog page" />

Later, you can open each requirement to provide more details and estimate its size.

![Requirement work item form](media/cmmi-requirement-form.png)  

::: moniker range="> tfs-2018"
Instead, you can bulk add requirements using [Excel](../../backlogs/office//bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/deprecate-project.md)]

Requirements specify the functions and product elements that teams need to create. Product owners typically define and stack rank requirements on the product backlog page. The team then scopes the size of the effort to deliver the highest priority items.

Use the following guidance and that provided for [fields used in common across work item types](#definitions-in-common) when filling out the form. For more information, see [Plan a project](cmmi/guidance-plan-a-project-cmmi.md).

## Track work progress

As work progresses, you change the State field to update the status. Optionally, you can specify a reason. The state and reason fields appear on the work item form in the header area. 

<img src="media/agile-bug-form-state-reason.png" alt="Bug work item form, header area" /> 

### CMMI workflow states 

These diagrams show the main progression and regression states for the Requirement, Bug, and Task WITs. 

> [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]  
> |Requirement  |Bug |Task |  
> |-------------|----------|---------| 
> |<img src="media/IC757081.png" title="Requirement workflow states, CMMI process" alt="Requirement workflow states, CMMI process" /> |<img src="media/IC757084.png" title="Bug workflow states, CMMI process" alt="Bug workflow states, CMMI process" /> |<img src="media/IC757087.png" title="Task workflow states, CMMI process" alt="Task workflow states, CMMI process" /> |

The typical workflow progression for a requirement is:  
-   The product owner creates a requirement in the **Proposed** state with the default reason, **New requirement**.  
-   The product owner updates the status to **Active** when they begin work to implement it.  
-   The team updates the status to **Resolved** when code development is finished and system tests have passed.  
-   Lastly, the team or product owner moves the requirement to **Closed** when the product owner agrees that it has been implemented according to the Acceptance Criteria and passed all validation tests.  

### Update work status with Kanban or taskboards

Teams can use the [Kanban board](../../boards/kanban-basics.md) to update the status of requirements, and the [sprint taskboard](../../sprints/task-board.md) to update the status of tasks. Dragging items to a new state column updates both the State and Reason fields.

<img src="../../boards/media/ALM_CC_MoveCard.png" alt="Web portal, Track progress on the Kanban board" />

You can customize the Kanban board to support more [swim lanes](../../boards/expedite-work.md) or [columns](../../boards/add-columns.md). For more customization options, see [Customize your work tracking experience](#customize-work-tracking).

## Map requirements to features

When you manage a suite of products or user experiences, you might want to view the scope and progress of work across the product portfolio. You can do view scope by [defining features](../../backlogs/define-features-epics.md) and [mapping requirements to features](../../backlogs/organize-backlog.md).

Using portfolio backlogs, you can [drill down from one backlog to another](../../plans/portfolio-management.md) to view the level of detail you want. Also, you can use portfolio backlogs to view a rollup of work in progress across several teams when you [setup a hierarchy of teams](../../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md).

The feature work item contains similar fields provided for requirements and includes other fields, as the following table describes.


## Define tasks


When your team manages their work in sprints, they can use the [sprint backlog page](../../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) to break down the work to be accomplished into distinct tasks.  

<img src="media/IC697755.png" alt="Web portal, Add task link on a sprint backlog page" />

Name the task and estimate the work it will take.

![CMMI Task work item form](media/cmmi-task-form.png)

When teams estimate work, they define tasks and estimate the hours or days to complete tasks. Teams forecast work and define tasks at the start of an iteration, and each team member does a subset of those tasks. Tasks can include development, testing, and other kinds of work. For example, a developer can define tasks to implement requirements, and a tester can define tasks to write and run test cases. By linking tasks to requirements and bugs, they see the progress made on these items. For more information, see [Iteration activities](cmmi/guidance-iteration-activities.md).

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::


## Track test progress 

### Test requirements

From the web portal or Test Manager, you can [create test cases that automatically link to a requirement or bug](../../../test/create-test-cases.md).  Or, you can link a requirement to a test case from the :::image type="icon" source="../../backlogs/media/icon-links-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: (links tab). 

![Select the test suite and add a test case](media/IC793453.png)  

The test case contains many fields, many of which are automated and integrated with Test Manager and the build process. For a description of each field, see [Query based on build and test integration fields](../../queries/build-test-integration.md).  

<img src="media/agile-test-case-form.png" alt="Web portal, Test case work item form" />

The :::image type="icon" source="../../backlogs/media/icon-links-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: (links tab) lists all the requirements and bugs in a test case. By using linking, the team can track the progress made in testing each item and supports information that appears in the [Requirements Overview Report](../../../report/sql-reports/requirements-overview-report-cmmi.md) report.

### Track code defects

You can [create bugs from the web portal web portal, Visual Studio, or when testing with Test Manager](../../backlogs/manage-bugs.md). 


## Track change requests, risks, issues, and notes captured in review meetings

Along with the requirement, feature, task, and bug WITs, you can track information recommended by the CMMI process with the following WITS.

-  [Change request](cmmi/guidance-change-request-field-reference-cmmi.md) to [manage proposed changes](cmmi/guidance-manage-change.md) to any work product that is under change control.  
-   [Issue](cmmi/guidance-bugs-issues-risks-field-reference-cmmi.md) to track an event or situation that might block work or is blocking work on the product. [Issues differ from risks](cmmi/guidance-manage-issues-cmmi.md) in that teams identify issues spontaneously, generally during daily team meetings. 
-   [Risk](cmmi/guidance-bugs-issues-risks-field-reference-cmmi.md) to track the probability  and degree of variance between actual and desired outcomes. When you [manage risks](cmmi/guidance-manage-risks.md), you strategically minimize the variance between the outcome that you want and the actual outcome.  
-   [Review](cmmi/guidance-review-meeting-field-reference-cmmi.md) to document the results of a design or code review. Team members can [capture the details of how the design or code meets standards](cmmi/guidance-implement-development-tasks.md) in areas of name correctness, code relevance, extensibility, code complexity, algorithmic complexity, and code security.  
<br/>
You can add an issue from the  [New work item widget](../../../report/dashboards/widget-catalog.md#new-work-item-widget) added to a [team dashboard](../../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md), or from the **New** menu on the Queries page. 

![Add work item from a New work item widget](media/cmmi-new-work-item-widget.png)  

Work items you add from the widget are automatically scoped to your team's default area and iteration paths. To change the team context, see [Switch team context](../../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/plans/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/plans/breadcrumb/toc.json).

### Backlog list order

The [Stack Rank](../../queries/planning-ranking-priorities.md) field is used to track the relative ranking of requirements, features, or epics. However, by default it doesn't appear on the work item form. The sequence of items on the backlog page is determined according to where you've [added the items or moved the items on the page](../../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md#move-items-priority-order). As you drag items, a background process updates this field.  

This field doesn't appear on the work item form.
