# Create your product backlog in Azure Boards 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Your product backlog corresponds to your project plan, the roadmap for what your team plans to deliver. You create your product backlog by adding user stories, backlog items, or requirements. As shown in the following image, your backlog consists of a flat list of work items. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The following image illustrates the product backlog image for a Scrum process for Azure DevOps Services. For the Agile, Basic, and CMMI process models, the **Backlog items** selection appears as **Stories**, **Issues**, and **Requirements**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of a Backlog of Scrum process product backlog items.](media/create-backlog/intro-image.png)

After you define it, you have a prioritized list of features and requirements to build. Your backlog also provides a repository of the information you need to track and share with your team. And, you can [interactively filter the backlog](filter-backlogs-boards-plans.md) to focus on a subset of work items.  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/note-configure-customize.md)]

Your backlog consists of a list of [work items](../work-items/about-work-items.md). 
You use work items to share information, assign work to team members, track dependencies, organize work, 
and more. Because the most important work appears at the top of the list, your team always knows what to work on next.

> [!NOTE]  
> Your product backlog is one of three classes of backlogs available to you, backlogs, boards, and plans. If you don't see the work items you expect on your backlog, see [Set up your backlogs and boards](set-up-your-backlog.md).   


## Add a backlog

If you have a project, you have a backlog. Each project defines a default team and set of backlogs for that team. You only need to add a backlog when you want to support a new team. When you add a team, you add various team assets. A team admin can configure the assets to support the way the team works. To add a set of backlogs to support a new team, see [Add a team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md). 

Each team's set of backlogs are associated with one or more work item types. The work item type associated with a backlog depends on the:

* Process selected at project creation
* Team configurations
* Process customizations 

The backlogs defined for each default process are:

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 
- [**Agile**](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md): **Stories**, **Features**, and **Epics**
- [**Basic**](../get-started/plan-track-work.md): **Issues** and **Epics** 
- [**Scrum**](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md): **Backlog items**, **Features**, and **Epics** 
- [**CMMI**](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md): **Requirements**, **Features**, and **Epics**
::: moniker-end 

::: moniker range="< azure-devops-2019" 
- [**Agile**](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md): **Stories**, **Features**, and **Epics**
- [**Scrum**](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md): **Backlog items**, **Features**, and **Epics** 
- [**CMMI**](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md): **Requirements**, **Features**, and **Epics**
::: moniker-end 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 
You choose the backlog level from the backlog selector as shown in the following image.  

:::image type="content" source="media/create-backlog/backlog-selector.png" alt-text="Choose backlog level, Backlog items, Stories, or Requirements.":::  
::: moniker-end 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019" 

To customize your backlogs with custom work item types, add portfolio backlogs or other supported options. See the following articles, depending on the process your project uses: 
- [Inherited process model](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md)
- [On-premises XML process model](../../reference/on-premises-xml-process-model.md).

## Track bugs on your backlog 

You can choose how you want to manage bugs. Some teams like to track bugs along with requirements on the backlog. Other teams like to track bugs as tasks completed in support of a requirement. The bugs then appear on their [taskboard](../sprints/task-board.md).

Before deciding, review [Configure and customize, Treat bugs as requirements or tasks](../configure-customize.md#show-bugs) for guidance. Or, go directly to [Show bugs on backlogs and boards](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md). 

<a id="convert-ideas" />

## Convert ideas into backlog items 

Your backlog shows work that you plan to do or have started to work on. As soon as the **State** of a work item is set to *Done* or *Completed*, the work item no longer shows up on your backlog. You can use the [backlog controls](product-backlog-controls.md) to filter or change your view. 

> [!TIP]  
> If you already have defined a long list of items, you don't have to reenter them one at a time. Instead, use [Import or update work items in bulk by using CSV files](../queries/import-work-items-from-csv.md) or [Microsoft Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) to quickly import them to your backlog.


::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Before you add work items, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/view-options-icon.png" border="false"::: **View options** and turn the slider for **Parents** and **Forecasting** to **Off**. Optionally, turn **In Progress Items** on or off. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add a product backlog item](media/create-backlog/view-options-parents-off.png) 

1. To add a work item, select :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-add-icon.png" border="false":::**New Work Item** and enter a title. Then press Enter or select **Add to top**.  Work items are automatically assigned the default **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** selected for the team. For more information, see [Configure team settings](../../organizations/settings/manage-teams.md). 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add the work item.](media/create-backlog/add-new-items-agile.png) 

	> [!NOTE]  
	> If you have **Stakeholder** access , you can only add work items to the bottom of the backlog. For more information, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md).

2. Repeat this step to capture all your ideas as work items.  

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

To build your backlog, enter a title and select **Add**. If you don't see the **Add** link, select **New** to open the quick add panel. Optionally, set **In progress items** to **Show** or **Hide**. Work items are automatically assigned the default **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** selected for the team. For more information, see [Configure team settings](../../organizations/settings/manage-teams.md). 

![Add work items to the backlog](media/create-backlog/add-new-items-standard.png) 

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have **Stakeholder** access , you can only add work items to the bottom of the backlog. For more information, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md).

Repeat this step until you capture all your main ideas. 

::: moniker-end

> [!NOTE]  
> Depending on whether you create your project with [Basic](../get-started/plan-track-work.md), [Agile](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md), the items in your backlog might be called issues, user stories, PBIs, or requirements. All three are similar. They describe the customer value to be delivered and the work to be performed.   
>
> By default, user stories appear on Agile backlogs, issues on Basic backlogs, PBIs and bugs appear on Scrum backlogs, and requirements appear on CMMI backlogs. 

<a id="reorder-backlog">  </a>
<a id="move-items-priority-order">  </a>

## Reorder your backlog

After you have some items in your backlog, reorder them to create a prioritized list of work. Review and prioritize your backlog frequently to help your team know what's most important to deliver next. 

> [!TIP]  
> You can't sort your backlog on a column. To view a sorted listed, select **Create query**. Save and open the query, and then sort the query results. To learn more about queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](../queries/using-queries.md).

To reorder your backlog, drag the work items. Or, if you prefer to use the keyboard, hold down the Alt key and use the up and down arrows.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Reorder work items](media/create-backlog/cyb-order-backlog.png)

> [!NOTE]  
> To reorder a backlog, you must have Basic or higher level access. If you have Stakeholder access, you can't reorder backlog items. For more information, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md).

Backlogs that participate in portfolio management or that contain nested same-type child items might not allow you to reorder the items. For more information, see these articles:  
- [Backlogs, portfolios, and Agile project management, Work with multi-team ownership of backlog items](backlogs-overview.md#multi-team)
- [Fix reordering and nesting issues](resolve-backlog-reorder-issues.md)

## Add details and estimates to backlog items

Building and prioritizing your backlog provides a high-level roadmap. Before your team can start work on any item, however, they need more details. Capture the details within the work item form.

To open each item, double-click or press Enter. Then add all the information you want to track.  Change one or more field values, add a description, or make a note in the **Discussion** section. You can also choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: **Attachments** tab and drag a file onto it to share the file with others.  

Enter as much detail as the team needs to:  
- Understand the scope. 
- Estimate the work required. 
- Develop tests. 
- Ensure that the end product meets acceptance criteria.

## Show/hide items that are in progress

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

From the **View options** selector, you can choose to show or hide **In Progress items**. If you turn the **In Progress** control off, then items that are in the *Active*, *Committed*, or *Resolved* states or states that map to the  [In Progress category state](../work-items/workflow-and-state-categories.md) won't appear in the backlog. 

::: moniker-end

Choose **In progress items** show or hide **In Progress** backlog items. If you turn the **In Progress items** control off, then items that are in the *Active*, *Committed*, or *Resolved* states or states that map to the  [In Progress category state](../work-items/workflow-and-state-categories.md) won't appear in the backlog. 
::: moniker-end

You usually choose to hide **In Progress items** when you want to forecast work. For more information, see [Forecast your product backlog](../sprints/forecast.md).

## Show/hide child items that are complete

From the **View options** selector, you can choose to show or hide **Completed Child items**.   

:::image type="content" source="media/create-backlog/completed-child-items-control-2020.png" alt-text="View options selector, Completed child items control":::

You usually choose to show Completed child items when you want to [view rollup columns](display-rollup.md).   

You usually choose to hide Completed child items when you want to forecast work. For more information, see [Forecast your product backlog](../sprints/forecast.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/note-closed-items.md)]
::: moniker-end


## Next steps

Now that you have a working backlog in place, your team can begin work on the top-priority items. From here, it's time to decide how you want to work as a team. Do you want to use Scrum or Kanban? You can use these methods independently or together.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Scrum: Schedule sprints](../sprints/define-sprints.md) or [Kanban](../boards/kanban-quickstart.md) 

Teams that want the least overhead for tracking and estimating might prefer Kanban. Teams that like to work at a steady cadence and plot the details of their sprint plan might prefer Scrum and sprint planning.
