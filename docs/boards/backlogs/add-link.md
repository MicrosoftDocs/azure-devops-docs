# Link user stories, issues, bugs, and other work items in Azure Boards  

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

Link work items to other work items to manage dependencies and see relationships within work. You can link work items within your project or to work items within another project in your organization. Use different link types to support different business goals. You can also link work items to other objects such as builds, commits, versioned items, or network resources.

Link work items to other work items to manage dependencies and see relationships within work. You can link work items within your project or to work items within another project in your collection. Use different link types to support different business goals. You can also link work items to other objects such as builds, commits, versioned items, or network resources. 

::: moniker-end

In general, you use the following link types when linking work items to one another: 

- Use **Parent/Child** links to link work items that you want to group within a hierarchy 
- Use **Predecessor/Successor** or **Affects/Affected by** links to link work items that have dependencies 
- Use **Duplicate/Duplicate of** links to link work items that track the same code defect or work 
- Use **Related** to link work items with some level of relationship, but not that strong 

You can add a link to a work item from within the work item form or from a backlog or query results list. From a backlog or query results list, you can select multiple work items and then link them to a new or existing work item. In general, use the bulk edit to update several work items to link to the same work item, either new or existing.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you want to link work items in a parent-child hierarchy, use the mapping pane as described in [Organize your backlog and map child work items to parents](organize-backlog.md). If you want to link test cases to user stories, see [Add, run, and update inline tests](../boards/add-run-update-tests.md) and [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).

For an overview of how links are used to support traceability, see [End-to-end traceability](../../cross-service/end-to-end-traceability.md). 

## Link guidance 

For an overview of which link types to use and link-related capabilities, see [Linking, traceability, and managing dependencies](../queries/link-work-items-support-traceability.md). In general, we recommend you follow these guidelines:

- For work items that appear on your backlogs, both product and portfolio, use the **Parent** and **Child** link types to create a hierarchy and group work. To quickly link many backlog work items within a hierarchy, see [Organize your backlog, map child work items to parents](organize-backlog.md).
- When linking work items with **Parent** and **Child** link types, avoid nesting work items of the same type. While the system allows you to nest work items of the same type, such as linking bugs to bugs or bugs to user stories when tracking both types on your product backlog, it can cause problems with drag-and-drop of work items on a backlog or display of items on a Kanban board. To learn more, see [Fix display, reordering, and nesting issues](resolve-backlog-reorder-issues.md). 
- To track dependencies of work items, use the **Predecessor** and **Successor** link types.  
- For all other general tracking purposes, use the **Related** link type. 

The following link relationships are restricted: 
- You can't assign a work item more than one parent using a **Parent/Child** or other tree-topology link type. To learn more about link types, see [Link type reference](../queries/link-type-reference.md).
- You can't add links in such a way as to create a circular relationship. 
- You can't link more than 1,000 work items to a single work item.

<a id="link"> </a>

## Link several work items 

1. From the web portal, open a [backlog](create-your-backlog.md) or [query results page](../queries/view-run-query.md), and [multi-select the work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md#multi-select) you want to add a link to.

2. Open the **&hellip;** context menu of one of the selected work items, choose **Add link**, and then choose **Existing item...** or **New item...**. 

    Here we multi-select from the product backlog and choose **Existing item...**.

    > ![Screenshot of backlog context menu, Multi-select items in backlog, open context menu, choose Add link to an existing work item.](media/add-link/multi-select-add-link-vsts.png)   


<a id="link-existing"> </a>  

## Link to an existing work item  

When you link work items, you select a link type. In general, use the following link types as indicated. To learn more about each link type, see [Link type reference](../queries/link-type-reference.md). 

- Use the **Duplicate** link type when two work items have been created that essentially capture the same information; close one of the work items and keep the other one active  
- Use the **Parent/Child** link types when you want to break down work items into smaller items&mdash;for example, break down features into stories, or stories into tasks
- Use  **Predecessor-Successor** link types when you want to track tasks that must be completed before others can be started; this link type is most often used when you plan work using Project 
- Use the **Related** link type when the work items being linked are at the same level&mdash;such as two user stories that define features that overlap one another&mdash;or to link work items that are defined in different projects or managed by different teams.


#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

From the **Add link** dialog, select the link type, enter a work item ID, and then choose OK. 

For example, here we use the **Related** link type to link three items to the bug with ID of *400*. 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Add link dialog, web portal, to an existing work item.](media/add-link/add-link-dialog-s136.png)  

To link to multiple work items, you can use inline add which finds work items based on your recent activity or keyword searches. Select one or more of the work items displayed automatically based on your recent activity, or enter a keyword. Keyword searches will display work items based on work items that include that keyword in their title. 

> [!NOTE]   
> You need to add each link one at a time. (You can no longer enter their IDs separated by commas or spaces.) To quickly find work items of interest, you can also use [work item search](../../project/search/functional-work-item-search.md).

::: moniker-end 

To view the work items selected for linking, you can choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/info.png" border="false":::.   
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Add link dialog to an existing work item](media/add-link/info-linked-items.png) 

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of backlog context menu, choose Add link to an existing work item, TFS-2018 and previous versions.](media/add-link/link-multi-to-existing.png)   

To link to multiple work items, enter their IDs separated by commas or spaces. If you don't know the IDs or you want to link to an item in a different project, you can choose the &hellip; context menu to open a dialogue that will support you in [choosing work items that are based on IDs, a query, or title keyword](#find-items). 
::: moniker-end 
  

If you're working from the Query Results page, you'll need to bulk save the work items you've modified. When you work from a backlog, work items are automatically saved.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Query results page, save bulk modified items.](media/bulk-modify/query-results-bulk-save-items.png) 
::: moniker-end 

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
![Screenshot of Query results page, multi-select items, bulk save modified work items, TFS-2018 and earlier versions.](media/bulk-modify-link-existing-bulk-save-ts.png) 
::: moniker-end 


### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)

From the Add link to Multiple Items dialog, select the link type, enter a work item ID, and then choose **OK**. 

For example, here we use the **Related** link type to link several items to the user story with ID of *4654*. 

![Screenshot of Visual Studio, Add link dialog.](media/add-link-related-existing-item-vs.png)         

To link to multiple work items, enter their IDs separated by commas or spaces. If you don't know the IDs or you want to link to an item in a different project, you can select the Browse button to open a dialogue that will support you in [choosing work items based on IDs, a query, or title keyword](#find-items). 

You'll need to bulk save the work items you've modified. 

* * *


## Link to a new work item   

Here, we've selected to add a link to the selected work items.  

1. Specify the link type, work item type, and title of the new work item. Choose **OK**.  

    ![Add link dialog, Link to a new work item, TFS-2018 and later versions.](media/add-link-related-new-item-issue.png)  


2. A work item of the type selected opens. Enter additional information and save the work item.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of new work item Issue added.](media/add-link/new-issue-linked-item.png)   

3. If you're working from the Query Results page, you'll need to bulk save the work items you've modified as shown in the previous procedure.  


::: moniker range="azure-devops"

<a id="remote-link"> </a>  

## Link to a remote work item 

You can link work items to objects defined in other Azure DevOps organizations as long as both organizations use the same Azure Active Directory to manage users. 

Choose from one of the following two remote link types supported. 

- Use the **Consumes From/Produces For** link types when you want to track dependencies of work items that are defined in different organizations and managed by different teams. 
- Use the **Remote Related** link type when the work items being linked are defined in different organizations and managed by different teams, but don't have strong inter-dependencies.

From the Add link dialog, select the link type, enter the URL of the remote work item, and then choose OK. 

For example, here we use the **Remote Related** link type to link to  work item ID *350* that exists in the *remotelinkingtest2* organization, *RemoteLinking* project. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Add link dialog, Add a link to an existing, remote work item.](media/add-link/add-remote-related-link.png)  

The link tab maintains a count of all links to the work item.  The [*Remote Link Count* field](../queries/linking-attachments.md) maintains a count of the number of links added to a work item that link to a work item defined in another project or organization. 

The following image shows an example of two remote links, indicated by the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/cloud-link.png" border="false":::  cloud icon, added to a user story. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of User Story form, Link tab, showing two external links.](media/add-link/link-tab-remote-links.png)  

::: moniker-end 


## Link several work items to a new git branch 

You can add a new git branch and link them to existing work items at the same time. 

From a backlog or query results page, [multi-select the work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md#multi-select) you want to link to a new git branch, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon, and then **New branch...**. To learn more, see [Link work items to Git development objects](connect-work-items-to-git-dev-ops.md).  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of backlog, context menu, choose Link multiple backlog items to a git branch.](media/add-link/link-git-branch.png)   


<a id="link-builds" />

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../includes/link-work-item-builds-projects.md)]

<a id="find-items"> </a> 

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

## Find work items to link to   

From the Add link dialog, you can open a secondary dialog to help you choose one or more work items to link to. If you're going to find and list work items to link to by using a saved query, first [define the query](../queries/using-queries.md) that you want to use. 

1.  From the Add link dialog, choose the &hellip; context menu or **Browse** button (Visual Studio) to open the following dialog. 

    ![Choose Linked work items](media/add-link-choose-linked-work-item-by-title.png)  

    If the work items are defined in another project, then first select the Project. Then, make your selections: 

    -   **Query**. Use this method when you've defined a query that you know contains the set or superset of the work items that you want.   
    -   **IDs**. Use this method when you know the IDs of the work items that you want to link to. 
          In the **IDs** box, type the IDs of the work items that you want to find, separated by commas or spaces. 
    -   **Title contains**. Use this method to find work items that have a common word or phrase in the title field. In the **and type** list, select the type of work item that you want to retrieve.   

        > [!NOTE]
        > To minimize the time required to run the query, narrow the filter criteria of the search.  

1.  Select the **Find** button.

     Only those work items defined for the selected project and specified work item type are listed. To sort on a column field, choose the column title. 

    <!-- You can change the display of the work items that are listed by using one of the following user interface controls:  
      To expand or collapse a tree view list, choose the + or signs.    
      To resize a column, point your cursor at the edge of a column header and drag it to a new location.    
      To sort on a column field, choose the column title.    
      To move a column field, choose the column title and drag to another location. -->  

1.  In the list of returned work items, select one or more work items.   

    - From the web portal: To select several items in a sequence, hold down the shift key. To select several non-sequential items, use the Ctrl key.   

    - For Visual Studio, select each work item that should link to the current work item. You can also press the SHIFT key while clicking to select a range of work items, or press the CTRL key while clicking to select multiple work items.

## More options for modifying links in bulk

Other features you can use to quickly link or change links that use the parent-child link type (some features are version-dependent, see the linked article for details):

- To quickly link backlog items to portfolio backlog items with parent-child links, [use the mapping pane to organize your backlog](organize-backlog.md#mapping). Or, you can choose to Show Parents and [drag-and-drop items within the tree hierarchy](organize-backlog.md).  
- To create and link tasks to backlog items, [use the sprint backlog page](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md).  
- To indent (![Indent](../queries/media/IC588323.png)), outdent (![Outdent](../queries/media/IC588324.png)), and change the tree hierarchy, use a tree query in Visual Studio.  
- To add or delete work items or change the link structure, you can use Excel. See [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

## Add, remove, and show links using Azure CLI

You can add, remove, and show details of links made to a work item using link types supported by your organization with the [az boards work-item relation](/cli/azure/boards/work-item/relation) command. To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md). 

Link types include work link types, remote link types, hyperlinks, and attached files. For a list of all link types that you can specify, run the [az boards work-item relation list-type](../queries/link-type-reference.md#list-link-types) command. 

```azurecli
az boards work-item relation add
az boards work-item relation remove
az boards work-item relation show
```

In the following examples, the organization is *fabrikam* and the project ID corresponds to *cebd7ef5-4282-448b-9701-88c8637581b7*. The table format is used to show the output. For other formats, see [Output formats for Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli).  


### Link work items 

To link one or more work item to a single work item, enter the [az boards work-item relation add](/cli/azure/boards/work-item/relation#az-boards-work-item-relation-add) command. 

#### Syntax 

Required parameters include the ID of the work item to link to and the link type. Supported link types include *Parent*, *Child*, *Related*, *Remote Related*. For a list of all link types that you can specify, run the [az boards work-item relation list-type](../queries/link-type-reference.md#list-link-types) command. 

For work items defined within the same organization, you must specify the work item ID or target URL. For work items defined in a remote organization, you must specify the target URL. You can specify multiple values by separating IDs or URLs with a comma.

```azurecli
az boards work-item relation add --id
                                 --relation-type
                                 [--detect {false, true}]
                                 [--org]
                                 [--target-id]
                                 [--target-url]
```

#### Example

The following command links work item *ID=2807* to work item *ID=2794* with the *Child* link type. The command returns a list of all links currently defined for the work item. 

```azurecli
az boards work-item relation add --id 2794 --relation-type Child --target-id 2856 --output table

### Remove work item links

To remove one or more linked work items from a single work item, enter the [az boards work-item relation remove](/cli/azure/boards/work-item/relation#az-boards-work-item-relation-remove) command.

Required parameters include the ID of the work item to remove the link from and the link type. You can only remove links to work items defined in the same organization. You can specify any of the supported link types except except remote link types. 

You must specify the target work item ID. You can specify multiple values by separating IDs or URLs with a comma.

#### Syntax 
```azurecli
az boards work-item relation remove --id
                                    --relation-type
                                    --target-id
                                    [--detect {false, true}]
                                    [--org]
                                    [--yes]
```

#### Example

The following command removes the link to work item *ID=2794* from work item *ID=2856* to work item  with the *Child* link type. The command returns a list of all links currently defined for the work item.

### Show details of links made for a single work item 

To view the work items linked to a single work item, enter the  [az boards work-item relation show](/cli/azure/boards/work-item/relation#az-boards-work-item-relation-show) command. For a list of all link types that can be returned, run the [az boards work-item relation list-type](../queries/link-type-reference.md#list-link-types) command.

#### Syntax 
```azurecli
az boards work-item relation show --id
                                  [--detect {false, true}]
                                  [--org]
```

#### Example

The following command lists the details of links defined for work item *ID=2931* in the *fabrikam* organization in table format.
