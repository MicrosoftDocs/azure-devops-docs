## Copy or clone a work item   

**Copy** a work item when you want to create a new work item that's a duplicate of an existing one. When you copy a work item, you create a new work item with a new ID, but the fields of the new work item are prepopulated with the same values as the original work item. You can then modify the fields of the new work item as needed. A related link to the original work item gets created and any parent link is copied over. No history or attachments are copied over from the original work item.

**Clone** a work item when you want to create an exact copy of an existing work item, including all the fields and attachments, but with a new ID. Cloning is useful when you want to create a new work item that's the same as an existing one, with no field modifications needed.

In other words, **copy** a work item to create a new work item with prepopulated values that you can adjust, and **clone** a work item to create an exact copy.

> [!NOTE]
> Some fields might get copied, depending on the on-premises version you're working with and how you customized your work item types. If the work item type of the work item that you clone has no state transition rule that says to clear the *Closed By* field when the *State* is **New** or **Active**, then that field gets copied. The current system out-of-box templates have this rule defined, which was added to TFS 2018 and later versions.

1. From the web portal, open the work item you want to copy or clone, open the &hellip; context menu, and choose **Create copy of work item**.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/copy/choose-copy-work-item-s171.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing open context menu with Create copy of work item highlighted.":::

2. Choose the project and work item type if different from the copied work item.  Optionally change the Title and provide more details. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/copy/copy-work-item-s171.png" alt-text="Copy work item dialog":::

	Optionally, check one or more of the boxes: 
 
	- **Include existing links**: To include all **Related** and external links in the copied work item.  A **Related** link gets created automatically for the work item copied, and included in the **Discussion** section. There's no method for disabling this feature.  
	- **Include existing attachments**: To include attachments in the copied work item
	- **Include child work items**: To include existing links to child work items in the copied work item. This feature isn't recursive. Only those work items directly linked as children to the work item being copied are included. This option appears even if there are no child items linked to the work item.  
	
	> [!NOTE]   
	> - When you copy the work item to a different project, **Include child work items** is disabled. 
	> - When you copy a work item and choose to **Include child work items**, a copy is made of each child work item and linked to the copied work item through a Parent-Child link. 
	> - The **Include child work items** feature requires installation of Azure DevOps Server 2020.1 update.   

3. In the work item form that opens, update other fields as needed. All work items start in the New state.

> [!TIP]    
> Copied or cloned work items always have an ID that is greater than the work items from which they were copied or cloned.

## Change the work item type  

If you have a large number of work items whose type you want to change, use [Change work item type](move-change-type.md). If the **Change work item type** option isn't available to you, you can export a set of work items using Excel or CSV, copy them to a new list, and reimport them by specifying a different work item type. See [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Import or update work items in bulk by using CSV files](../queries/import-work-items-from-csv.md).

## Copy a list of work items  

You can copy an HTML formatted table of selected items from either a backlog page or query results list. Then, you can send an email of this list using your choice of email client, or paste the list into a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or other application. 

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"
> [!NOTE]  
> The data copied with **Copy as HTML** is the same as that copied when you select **Email selected work items**. If you don't have an SMTP server configured, you can work around this by using **Copy as HTML**. For on-premises Azure DevOps, all email actions require an [SMTP server to be configured](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts). 
::: moniker-end

1. From the web portal, open a backlog or query results page, and [multi-select the work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md#multi-select) you want to copy to the clipboard. 

2. Open the &hellip; context menu of one of the selected work items, and then choose **Copy to clipboard** or **Copy as HTML**. 

    Here we multi-select from the product backlog and choose <b>Copy to clipboard</b>.

    ![backlog page, multi-select items, open context menu, Copy to clipboard](media/copy-work-item-copy-to-clipboard-ts-1.png) 

## Paste the contents into your email client

Paste the contents of the clipboard into your email client or other application. To open a linked work item, requires users to have read access to the project or area node for those work items. 

The formatted table contains a link to each work item included in your selected results list. A link to a query that opens only those work items selected is also provided.

## Copy the URL

### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

<img src="media/add-work-item-copy-URL.png" alt="Copy hyperlink for a work item from web portal" />


### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)

In Visual Studio, right-click the work item tab to copy the URL. The URL opens the work item in the web portal.
