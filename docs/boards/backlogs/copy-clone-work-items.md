# Copy or clone work items  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]    

There are two types of copy functions you can use. The first is to duplicate a single work item, referred to as copy or clone. In addition, you can choose to change the project or work item type when copying/cloning a work item. 

The second copy function is to copy a multi-selected list of work items to the clipboard, referred to as copy as HTML or copy to clipboard. 

Use this article to learn how to:

## Copy or clone a work item   

Clone a work item when you want to create another instance of it. This action opens a form with all fields filled out. Copy a work item when you want to create another instance of it and optionally change its work item type. This action opens a form with all fields filled out except for the Title. A related link to the original work item is created. Also any parent link is copied over. No history or attachments are copied over from the original work item.  

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible that some fields are copied over depending on the on-premise version you are working with and how you have customized your work item types. If the work item type of the work item that you are cloning has no state transition rule that says to clear the  Closed By field when the State is New or Active, then that field will get copied over. The current system out-of-box templates have this rule defined. It was added to TFS 2018 and later versions.

## Change the work item type  

If you have a large number of work items whose type you want to change, use [Change work item type](../../reference/add-modify-wit.md). If Change work item type isn't available to you, you can export a set of work items using Excel, copy them to a new Excel list, and re-import them by specifying a different work item type. See [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

## Copy a list of work items  

With this option, you can copy an HTML formatted table of selected items from either a backlog page or query results list. You can then email this list using your choice of email client, or paste into a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or other application. 

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"
> [!NOTE]  
>The data copied with **Copy as HTML** is the same as that copied when you select **Email selected work items**. If you don't have an SMTP server configured, you can work around this by using **Copy as HTML**. For on-premises TFS, all email actions require an [SMTP server to be configured](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts).

## Paste the contents into your email client

Paste the contents of the clipboard into your email client or other application. To open a linked work item, requires users to have read access to the project or area node for those work items. 

The formatted table contains a link to each work item included in your selected results list. A link to a query that will open only those work items selected is also provided.
