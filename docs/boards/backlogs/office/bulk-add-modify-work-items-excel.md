# Bulk add or modify work items with Excel 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

When you have a lot of work items to add or modify, using Microsoft Excel can save you time. [Use a flat list](../../queries/using-queries.md#flat-list-query) to bulk add or modify several types of work items at once, such as backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues. [Use a tree list](../../queries/using-queries.md#tree-query) to bulk add or modify work items and their parent-child links.

You can also bulk add and modify work items using [Microsoft Project](create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md).

In this article you'll learn:  

>[!div class="checklist"]    
> * Connect to a project from Excel 
> * Add or edit work items and publish your changes to Azure Boards or TFS
> * Refresh your Excel worksheet with the latest changes made to the work tracking data store   
> * Select user accounts  
> * Add hierarchically linked backlog items and tasks   
> * Work with different list types

## Add work items

1.  If you don't have Microsoft Excel 2007 or a more recent version, [install it](https://products.office.com/excel). For Azure Boards and TFS 2017 and later versions, you'll need Excel 2010 or a later version. 

2.  If you haven't installed a version of [Visual Studio (2010 or later)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) or the [Team Foundation Server Standalone Office Integration (free)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=832491&clcid=0x409), you'll need to install one of these versions to connect to an Azure DevOps or TFS project. 
	
	> [!NOTE]   
	>The only way to get the Team Foundation plug-in is by installing one of the latest editions of Visual Studio or the TFS Standalone Office Integration installer. The TFS Office Integration supports connection to Azure Boards and TFS from Excel, Project, and the PowerPoint-based storyboarding tool.

3.  In Excel, start with a blank worksheet. If you don't see the **Team** ribbon (or the **Team** menu if you use Excel 2007), see step 2 or [TFS-Office integration issues](tfs-office-integration-issues.md). 

	(1) Choose Team tab, (2) place your cursor in Cell A1, and then (3) choose **New List**.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Team Ribbon, Choose New List](_img/bulk-modify-excel-blank-list.png)

    > [!TIP]  
    > If the **Team** ribbon no longer appears, you might need to [re-enable it](tfs-office-integration-issues.md). 

4.  Connect to your project where you want to add work items. If you can't connect, [get added as a team member](../../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md#add-team-members).  

    ![New List](_img/excel/team-ribbon.png)

    If it is your first time connecting from Excel, you might have to add the URL to the list of recognized servers.

	**Azure Boards**  

	(1) Choose **Servers...**, (2) choose **Add...**, (3) enter the URL of your Azure Boards organization, (4) check that the preview matches the URL that you entered, and then choose **OK**. 

	![Connect to Team Foundation Server dialog](_img/connect/4-steps-connect-to-cloud.png)

	**TFS**  

	(1) Choose **Servers...**, (2) choose **Add...**, (3) enter the name of your TFS instance. As needed, change the Port number if your deployment uses a non-default port number.   The Preview entry should display the correct URL for your deployment. (4) Choose **OK**.  

    ![Connect to Team Foundation Server dialog](_img/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project/IC658167.png)

	Choose **Close** to close the Add/Remove servers dialog. From the Select a Team Foundation Server dialog, make sure the server you added is selected, and then choose **Connect**. 

5. From the New List dialog, choose **Input list**.  

    ![Select input list](_img/bulk-modify-excel-new-input-list.png)

6.  Your worksheet is now bound to your project as a flat list. What this means is that you can add work items to the project from the worksheet or add work items to the worksheet from the project.

    ![Empty flat list connected to a project](_img/bulk-modify-excel-connected-list.png)

7.  Specify the titles of the work items you want to add and their work item type.

    ![Add work items to Excel](_img/bulk-modify-excel-connected-list-user-stories.png)

    Notice how the **State** and **Reason** fields automatically fill in with default values once your select the work item type.

8.  Publish your worksheet.

    ![Publish work items from Excel to the data store](_img/bulk-modify-excel-publish.png)

    Make sure your cursor is in a cell that contains data. Otherwise, the **Publish** button might appear disabled.

    Notice how IDs are now assigned to your work items.

    ![Published work item IDs show in Excel](_img/bulk-modify-excel-notice-ids.png)

9.  Also, note how you can open a work item in the web portal to add more information.

    ![Open a work item in the web portal from Excel](_img/bulk-modify-excel-open-web-access.png)

    ![Work item displayed in the web portal](_img/bulk-modify-excel-user-story-web-access.png)

You can make changes to work items in Excel, Project, the web portal, or Visual Studio, or Team Explorer Everywhere.

> [!TIP]
>**Follow these tips to keep your work in sync:**   
>- When you first open a saved worksheet, use ![Refresh icon in Excel on Team ribbon](_img/bulk-modify-excel-refresh-inline.png) (**Refresh**) to download the latest data from the data store.  
>- Enter data for additional fields by adding columns to the worksheet using ![Choose Column icon in Excel on Team ribbon](_img/bulk-modify-excel-choose-columns-inline.png) <strong>Choose Columns</strong>.  
>- To avoid data conflicts, publish your additions and modifications often.  
>- To prevent loss of data before you publish or refresh, save your workbook periodically.  


<a id="select-user"></a>
## Select user accounts 

> [!NOTE]  
> To access the [Select User](#select-user) feature, you need to install [Visual Studio (at least VS 2015.1 or later version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Team Foundation Server Office Integration 2015 Update 2 or later version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). You can download the free version of Visual Studio Community. Get this feature to avoid data validation errors by misspelling user names and when you must assign user names from a large group of user accounts.  

You can use the Select User feature to find user accounts and assign values to person named fields. Also, this feature provides access to the most recently used (MRU) values. If your team contains several hundreds or thousands of user accounts, you'll want to use this feature.  

1. If you haven't installed or updated to the latest version of [Visual Studio (at least VS 2015.1 or later version](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), do that now. You need the latest update in order to access the Select User feature.  

2. Click a person-named field to activate the Select User feature in the team ribbon.  

	![Team ribbon, Select User](_img/bulk-add-excel-select-user-team-ribbon.png)  

	A person-named field is any field whose ```syncnamechanges``` attribute has been set to [synchronize with Active Directory, Azure Active Directory, or a Workgroup](../../../reference/xml/field-definition-element-reference.md).  

3. Begin typing the name of the user account and the Assign User dialog will automatically filter the results until you can select the account of interest.  

	![Assign User dialog](_img/bulk-add-excel-assign-user.png)  

	Enter a letter to tab to the start of names beginning with that letter. Enter only user names as account aliases aren't recognized.   

	You'll notice that as you select user names, Excel remembers your recent selections and you can select those user accounts directly from the field.   

	![Assigned to field, Drop-down menu shows most recently used values](_img/bulk-add-excel-assign-to-field.png)  

> [!TIP]  
> Without the Select User feature active, you must enter user names exactly as they are in the database, or you'll receive data validation errors upon trying to publish.  

<a id="tree-list"></a>

## Add linked backlog items and tasks 

You can bulk add a nested list of work items, such as a work break down structure or a hierarchical set of user stories and customer experiences. For example, you can add a nested list of tasks, subtasks, and bugs, as shown in the following illustration, or linked tasks to product backlog items, as described in the following steps.

Here's how a three-level nested tree of items appears in Excel:   

![Tree list of work items](_img/IC354953.png)

1.  Follow steps 1 through 6 from the previous procedure.

2.  Convert your flat list to a tree list by adding a tree level.

    ![Convert flat list to tree list](_img/bulk-modify-excel-convert-to-tree-composite.png)

    Notice how the list type is now labeled **Tree**, and an additional **Title 2** column has been inserted.

    ![Empty tree list connected to data store](_img/bulk-modify-excel-tree-list-type.png)

3.  Enter titles for backlog items under **Title 1** and for tasks, under **Title 2**. Also, select the corresponding work item type for each. Here we specify Task.

    ![Tree list of work items to publish](_img/bulk-modify-excel-tree-list-with-tasks.png)

4.  Just as before, publish your worksheet and notice how IDs are assigned to the new work items.

    ![Publish a tree list of work items](_img/bulk-modify-excel-published-tree-list.png)

    In the background, parent-child links are created for each task listed under a user story.



## Useful tips when working with a tree list 

- The plug-in interprets the data in the **Title** columns to determine the pattern of links between work items. When you publish changes, any of the following conditions can result in an error, an invalid link, or a tree link to be created between incorrect work items:
	- A row between parent and child work items is blank. 
	- The Title of a work item is in the wrong column. Make sure you enter a title for each child work item.
	- Within a row, multiple **Title** columns contain data. Enter text in only one of the title columns within each row.
	- The list was sorted. Don't sort a tree list. Sorting a tree list can change the hierarchical link relationships. If you do sort a tree list, you can recover from this operation by immediately refreshing.
- To resolve an error, see [Resolve invalid links in an Excel tree list](resolve-excel-invalid-links-tree-list.md).
- You can use the ![indent item in tree](_img/bulk-modify-excel-indent-inline.png) or ![Outdent item in tree](_img/bulk-modify-excel-outdent-inline.png) indent/outdent icons to demote or promote a work item within the tree hierarchy. Verify that the column to the left or right of the parent work item's title is a **Title** column. The header at the top of the column should read **Title** &lt;number&gt;, if it does not, add a tree level.
- A parent-child linked work item can only have one parent. You can't add the same work item task to two backlog items. Instead, you need to define distinct work item tasks.
- If you receive error TF208104, changes you made to the fields are published, but all changes you made to the link hierarchy are not published. At least one of the link relationships defined for the work item is locked by another process, such as Project Server integration. For more information, see [Addressing Error TF208104: Hierarchical Link Relationship Is Locked](resolve-excel-invalid-links-tree-list.md#tf208104). 
- When you move a work item, make sure that you select the entire table row. 


## Work with different list types 

Select your list structure based on these guidelines.  

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="60%"><p>Task</p></th>
<th width="15%"><p>List structure</p></th>
<th width="15%"><p>List refresh</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Create and publish many unrelated work items</p></td>
<td><p>Flat list</p></td>
<td><p>Input list</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Perform bulk edits on many unrelated work items</p></td>
<td><p>Flat list</p></td>
<td><p>Query list or input list</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Perform bulk edits on many work items and their dependent or related work items</p></td>
<td><p>Tree list</p></td>
<td><p>Query list</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Perform top down planning and publish parent-child linked work items</p></td>
<td><p>Tree list</p></td>
<td><p>Input list</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>View and modify the hierarchy and parent-child link relationships of many work items</p></td>
<td><p>Tree list</p></td>
<td><p>Query list</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Review reports based on a filtered set of work items that change over time</p></td>
<td><p>Flat or tree list</p></td>
<td><p>Query list</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Enable the Tree commands

If the Tree group commands are not available, your worksheet is configured as a flat list. You can convert the flat list to a tree list as described in step 2 in [Add backlog items and tasks and their parent-child links using a tree list](#tree-list).

### Convert a tree to a flat list

First, publish whatever changes you have made. Then, on the **Team** ribbon, choose **Configure**, **List**, and then choose **Refresh work items only**. This will flatten the tree structure and change the query list to an input list.

### Remove a tree level

Remove any content entered under the tree-level **Title** *number* column you want to remove&mdash;the highest numbered column&mdash;and, then **Refresh** your worksheet.

> [!TIP]  
> Always publish changes that you have made to work items before you remove a tree level. Removing a tree level requires a refresh, which overwrites data in the work item list. You will lose any data you have not published. 
 

### Convert from an input list to a query

On the **Team** ribbon, choose **Configure**, **List**, and then select the query you want to use. The worksheet will refresh with only those work items returned by the query. Also, if you select a tree query, then the list becomes a tree list.

### Add existing work items to a list

If you're working with a non-query input list, you can add work items by choosing ![Get work items icon](_img/bulk-modify-excel-get-work-items-inline.png) from the Team ribbon. If you're working from a query, then you need to [modify your query](../../queries/using-queries.md) to contain the work items you want. Then refresh your list.


## Bulk edit test cases

You can't use Excel to export and import test case steps or other test artifacts. Instead, use the [grid view to bulk edit test cases supported via the web portal](../../../test/reference-qa.md#q-is-there-a-way-to-quickly-add-multiple-test-cases-at-the-same-time).  

## Related articles

While the examples shown here represent connecting to an on-premises TFS, you can connect to Azure Boards and bulk add and modify work items. Once you've connected to the cloud server, you use the same procedures to work in Excel. 

- [Bulk modify work items (web portal)](../../backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md)  
- [Basic Excel tasks](https://support.office.com/Article/Basic-tasks-in-Excel-2013-363600c5-55be-4d6e-82cf-b0a41e294054) 

To bulk edit links, you can use these clients:  
-   Use Excel to edit parent-child or hierarchical links.  
-   Use [Project](../../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md) to edit parent-child and predecessor-successor link relationships.  
-   Use the web portal, to [map backlog items to portfolio backlog items](../../backlogs/organize-backlog.md) which creates parent-child links.  
-   Use either the web portal or Team Explorer, to modify parent-child links by [dragging items within a hierarchical backlog page](../../backlogs/organize-backlog.md#reparent) or within a tree query.

To resolve publishing errors, see one of these topics:

- [Data validation errors](resolve-excel-data-validation-errors.md)  
- [Invalid links](resolve-excel-invalid-links-tree-list.md)  

### Delete work items

You can't delete work items from Excel. The only way to delete work items is from the web portal or the **witadmin** command line tool. For details, see [Move, change, or delete work items](../../backlogs/remove-delete-work-items.md).

### Direct link query converts to flat list

When you open a direct links query in Excel, the Team Foundation add-in converts the list to a flat list. While you can modify values for the fields and add work items, you can't view nor modify link relationships. 

### Multiple worksheets

Each worksheet in Excel can contain a different input list or query. However, all worksheets within the workbook must connect to the same project within a project collection.  

To bulk add or modify work items in a different project, open a new Excel workbook. 

### Use Excel cut and paste functions

You can use many Excel features, such as cut, paste, automatic fill, format, sort (flat list only), filter, and add formulas.  You can cut and paste rows to re-sequence items within a list and change link relationships among work items.

To drag a work item, select the work item or contiguous set of work items that you want to move, open the context menu and choose **Select**, **Table Row**, point to the border of the selection, and&mdash;when the pointer becomes a move pointer ![Move Pointer](_img/bulk-modify-excel-pointer-icon.png)&mdash;drag the row to another location.

> [!TIP]  
> When you refresh the work item list, not all formats may be retained. For example, date formats are set by the server data store. Any changes you make to a date format field will be overwritten with the date format used by the server.  

### Web portal and Excel access

To open Excel from a web portal query, install the [VSTS Open in Excel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blueprint.vsts-open-work-items-in-excel) marketplace extension. 

To use Excel, you must get the Team Foundation add-in, which installs when you install Visual Studio or Team Explorer. If you don't have one of these versions installed, [install it now](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs). You can install Visual Studio Community for free.

Once you've installed Visual Studio, open Excel and look for the Team ribbon.

### Disable the Team Foundation Add-in 

If you want to disable the add-in, see [Add or remove an add-in](https://support.office.com/en-sg/article/Add-or-remove-add-ins-0af570c4-5cf3-4fa9-9b88-403625a0b460).

### Enable the Developer tab 

See [Show the Developer Tab on the Ribbon](/visualstudio/vsto/how-to-show-the-developer-tab-on-the-ribbon).

### Excel for Mac 

macOS is not supported. You need to use Excel on the same computer where you have installed Visual Studio or Team Explorer in order to get the Team Foundation add-in. These applications require Windows.
