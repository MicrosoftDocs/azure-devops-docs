## Publish and refresh work items

::: moniker range="> tfs-2018"

When you add or update work items from Excel, local copies of your work items are created. To keep data in sync, it's important to refresh your local file when you open it and publish and refresh frequently during a long online session.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

When you add or update work items from Excel or Project, local copies of your work items are created. To keep data in sync, it's important to refresh your local file when you open it and publish and refresh frequently during a long online session.

::: moniker-end

At first, the data in the local document matches the data in the database. But you or other team members can change the data about work items and cause the two to differ. To view the most recent changes from the database, refresh the document. The refresh downloads the latest values in the data store to your local document. To write changes from the document to the database, publish the changes. Publishing uploads the changes you made to the work item tracking data store.

To keep work items in sync from your local data store and Azure Boards, publish and refresh often.

### Azure DevOps and Excel

![Azure DevOps and Excel, conceptual image](media/connect/excel-sequence.png)

To work in Excel, see [Bulk add work items with Excel](bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md).

## Connect an Azure DevOps project to Excel

> [!NOTE]
> While this section illustrates how to connect Excel to an Azure Boards project, the steps for connecting from Project or PowerPoint are similar.

To add or modify work items by using Excel, you connect your worksheet to a project. Establishing this connection binds the document to the Azure DevOps project to exchange information.

> [!NOTE]
> When you connect to Azure Boards in the cloud, the **Team Project Collection** is automatically selected as there is only one collection associated with your Azure DevOps Services organization. When you connect to Azure Boards in an on-premises server, you choose the **Team Project Collection** prior to choosing the project.

You can start work from the web portal, Excel, or Visual Studio/Team Explorer. Your worksheet is associated with either a list of work items or a work item query.

### [Open query in Excel (web portal)](#tab/open-excel)

This connection method requires that you have installed [Azure DevOps Open in Excel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blueprint.vsts-open-work-items-in-excel). It also requires Visual Studio 2017 or later version.

1. From your web browser, (1) check that you've selected the right project, (2) choose **Boards>Queries**, and then (3) choose **All**.

> [!TIP]
> You can use multiple worksheets within an Excel workbook to work with different input or query lists. However, you can only connect to one project per workbook.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

If you move your Azure DevOps project to a different project collection in the same instance of Azure DevOps, your documents automatically reconnect. However, if the project moves to a different instance of Azure DevOps, you must manually reconnect your documents to the new server.

::: moniker-end


## Work offline and reconnect to Azure Boards

One advantage of working in Excel or Project is that you can work offline and add or modify work items. The following procedures show you how to disconnect an Excel work item list or a Project plan from Azure Boards. You can then reconnect later to synchronize the document with the work item database.

> [!NOTE]
> If the project that contains work items for your Excel or Project document is moved to a different organization or Azure DevOps Server instance, you must reconfigure the server to which the document connects. For more information, see [Connect Azure DevOps project to Excel](#connect-an-azure-devops-project-to-excel) provided earlier in this article.

### Disconnect a document file from the network

To disconnect an Excel or Project document file from the network:

1. Open the document that you want to change while you're offline.

1. Refresh the work item list to retrieve the latest information from the work item database.

   - If you're using Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Refresh**.
   - If you're using Project, on the **Team** menu, choose **Refresh**.

1. If you're using Excel, add to the work item list the columns for all fields that you want to modify.

   You can't add columns when the work item list is disconnected from the server.

1. Disconnect your computer from the network, or save the work item list file and copy it to another computer.

   An error message might appear that tells you the Office program couldn't establish a connection with an Azure DevOps Server.

1. Modify or update the work item list as needed.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can't create most types of links between work items when the work item document is disconnected from the system. The exceptions are parent-child links in an Excel tree list, and both parent-child and predecessor-successor links in a Project plan.

### Reconnect a file to Azure Boards

To reconnect an Excel or Project document file:

1. Reconnect your computer to the network, or copy the file to a computer that is connected to Azure Boards.

1. If you changed the document while you were offline, follow one of these steps:

   - If you're using Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Publish**.
   - If you're using Project, on the **Team** menu, choose **Publish Changes**.

1. If you didn't change the document while you were offline, follow one of these steps:

   - If you're using Excel, on the **Team** ribbon, in the **Work Items** group, choose **Refresh**.
   - If you're using Project, on the **Team** menu, choose **Refresh**.

1. Resolve any data validation errors or conflicts that occur.
