# Remove, delete, or restore work items 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-all.md)]

Work items can live forever in your work tracking data store. You never have to delete them. However, depending on your business needs, you may want to perform one or more of these actions: 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"
- **Change state**: Remove work items from appearing on backlogs and boards by simply changing the work item **State** to *Remove* or *Cut*.  
- **Delete**: Remove work items from backlogs, boards, and queries. Deleted work items are moved to a Recycle Bin. From the Recycle Bin you can restore or permanently delete them. 
- **Destroy**: Permanently delete work items, deleting all data from the work tracking data store. 
- **Restore**: Recover deleted work items, restoring them from the Recycle Bin.  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2013"
- **Change state**: Remove work items from appearing on backlogs and boards by simply changing the work item **State** to *Remove* or *Cut*.  
- **Destroy**: Permanently delete work items, deleting all data from the work tracking data store. 
::: moniker-end

The ability to archive work items or projects isn't a supported feature at this time.

## Prerequisites 


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"
- To remove, modify, or delete work items, you must be a member of the **Contributors** group or have the following permissions set to **Allow**. 
	- [Remove work items](#remove): Have the **View work items in this node** and **Edit work items in this node** Area Path permissions set to **Allow**.   
	- [Delete work items](#delete) and [Restore work items](#restore): Have the **Delete and restore work items** project-level permission set to **Allow**. Also, to restore work items, you must have **Basic** access or higher. Users with **Stakeholder** access can view the contents of the **Recycle Bin**, but can't restore or permanently delete items in the bin.

## Remove or delete multiple work items 

You can perform operations on individual work items or bulk modify several work items. 

From the web portal, you can multi-select several work items from a backlog or query results page and perform a bulk update using the associated feature. To delete or restore several work items at the same time, see [Bulk modify work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md).  

::: moniker-end

<a id="remove"> </a>  

## Remove work items

By changing the **State** of a work item to *Removed*, you effectively remove it from a backlog or board view (product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs, Kanban board, and taskboards). The *Removed* state corresponds to the **Removed** workflow category state. If you define custom workflow states, any state you map to the **Removed** workflow category state will act in a similar way. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Change State to Removed](media/move-change-delete/remove-state.png)  

To cause removed items to not show up in queries, you must add a clause that filters on the **State** field.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

> [!NOTE]  
> The *Removed* state isn't supported with the Basic process. It is only supported with the Agile, Scrum, and CMMI process work item types. The Basic process is available when you add a project to Azure DevOps Services or [Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2097609).

## Delete work items   

Deleted work items won't appear in your backlogs, boards, or queries. Deleted items are moved to a **Recycle Bin** from which you can recover them if needed. To delete a test case, test plan, or test suite, or other test-related work item types, see [Delete test artifacts](delete-test-artifacts.md).  


::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. You can delete a work item from within the work item form, by multi-selecting work items from a backlog or query results page, or from a Kanban board or taskboard. 

	To delete a single work item, open the work item, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon and select **Delete**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![work item form, actions menu, Delete](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-item.png)  
	To delete several work items, [multi-select them from a backlog or a query results list](bulk-modify-work-items.md) and then choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon and select <strong>Delete</strong>. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![List of work items, actions menu, Delete](media/move-change-delete/multi-delete.png) 

	To delete a work item from your Kanban or taskboard, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon of the card and select <strong>Delete</strong>. 
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Delete work item from Kanban board](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-from-kanban-board.png)
	>
1. Confirm you want to actually delete the item(s).

## Delete or destroy work items (command line)

You can delete or destroy a work item with the [az boards work-item delete](/cli/azure/boards/work-item#ext-azure-devops-az-boards-work-item-delete) command. To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).  

> [!NOTE] 
> You can restore work items you **delete**, but you can't restore work items you choose to **destroy**.

```azurecli 
az boards work-item delete --id
                           [--destroy]
                           [--org]
                           [--project]
                           [--yes] 
``` 

#### Parameters 

- **id**: Required. The ID of the work item.
- **destroy**: Optional. Permanently delete this work item.
- **org**: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization using `az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`. Example: `--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.
- **project**: Name or ID of the project. You can configure the default project using `az devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`.
- **yes**: Optional. Do not prompt for confirmation.

#### Example 

The following command permanently deletes the bug with the ID 864 and doesn't prompt you for confirmation.

```azurecli
az boards work-item delete --id 864 --destroy --yes
```

## Destroy work items (command line)  

Use the **witadmin destroywi** command to permanently remove work items from the data store. A permanent delete means all information in the work tracking data store is deleted and cannot be restored nor reactivated.  

> [!NOTE]   
> Deleting work items from the **witadmin** command line is deprecated for TFS 2018.2 and later versions, and not supported for Azure Boards cloud service.  

Open a Command Prompt window where the latest version of Visual Studio is installed and change the directory to where the **witadmin.exe** tool has been installed.  
::: moniker-end  
::: moniker range="tfs-2018"  
For example, you would change to the following directory for TFS 2018. (For other versions, see [Remove work items permanently (witadmin destroywi)](../../reference/witadmin/remove-work-items-permanently.md)).  

`%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2018\Professional\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer`  
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2017"  
For example, you would change to the following directory for TFS 2017. (For other versions, see [Remove work items permanently (witadmin destroywi)](../../reference/witadmin/remove-work-items-permanently.md)).  

`%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer`  
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2015"  
For example, you would change to the following directory for TFS 2015. (For other versions, see [Remove work items permanently (witadmin destroywi)](../../reference/witadmin/remove-work-items-permanently.md)).  

`cd %programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE` 
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2013"  
For example, you would change to the following directory for TFS 2013. (For other versions, see [Remove work items permanently (witadmin destroywi)](../../reference/witadmin/remove-work-items-permanently.md)).  

`cd %programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE` 
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2018"  
On a 32-bit edition of Windows, replace %programfiles(x86)% with %programfiles%.      

The **witadmin** command-line tool installs with any version of Visual Studio or Team Explorer. You can access this tool by installing the [free version of Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).  

- To delete several work items, enter the server name and directory path to the collection. For example:   

	``` CLI
	witadmin destroywi /collection:http://TFSServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /id:12,15,23
	```
- To delete a single work item, simply enter the ID as shown:  

	``` CLI
	witadmin destroywi /collection:http://TFSServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /id:2003
	```    
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"  

## How delete and restore actions work  

**When you delete a work item, the following actions occur:**

- Generates a new revision of the work item  
- Updates the **Changed By/Changed Date** fields to support traceability  
- Preserves the work item completely, including all field assignments, attachments, tags, and links  
- Causes work item to become non-queryable and therefore won't appear in any work tracking experience, query result, or report  
- Updates charts accordingly, CFD, velocity, burndown and lightweight charts are updated to remove deleted work items  
- Removes work tracking extensions  
- Preserves trend data except for the latest value 
- Removes the work item from the data warehouse/cube similar to as if it was permanently removed.  


**When you restore a work item, the following actions occur:**   

- Causes a new revision of the work item to be made  
- Updates the **Changed By/Changed Date** fields to support traceability   
- Becomes queryable  
- All fields remain unchanged  
- History contains two new revisions, one for deletion, and one for restore  
- Reattaches work tracking extensions  
- Updates charts accordingly, CFD, velocity, burndown and lightweight charts are updated to include the restored work items  
- Restores trend data  
- Adds the work item back to the data warehouse/cube  
- Sets the area or iteration path fields to the root node if the previous area path or iteration paths were deleted.

ARCHIVE WORK ITEMS
 I am looking for a way to archive the work items to an on-premise file share as a Disaster Recovery solution. It would be good to have a tool or a feature in Azure DevOps that could do that for us.
