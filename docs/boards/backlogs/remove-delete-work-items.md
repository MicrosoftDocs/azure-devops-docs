# Remove, delete, or restore work items in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Work items can live forever in your work tracking data store. You never have to delete them. However, you might want to set up a work item management process for one of the following actions: 

- **Change state**: Remove work items from appearing on backlogs and boards by changing the work item **State** to *Remove* or *Cut*. The state available to you is based on the workflow assigned to the work item type.  
- **Delete**: Remove work items from backlogs, boards, and queries. Deleted work items are moved to a **Recycle Bin**.   
- **Restore**: Recover deleted work items by restoring them from the **Recycle Bin**.  
- **Destroy**: Permanently delete work items, which deletes all data from the work tracking data store. 
 
> [!NOTE]  
> The ability to archive work items or projects isn't a supported feature at this time.

## Prerequisites 

In general, members of the **Contributors** group can remove, delete, and restore work items. To permanently delete work items, you must be a member of the **Project Administrators** group, or be granted the required permission. Users with **Stakeholder** access can view the contents of the **Recycle Bin**, but can't restore or permanently delete items in the bin regardless of the permissions they're granted.

## Remove or delete multiple work items 

You can act on individual work items or bulk modify several work items. 

From the web portal, you can multi-select several work items from a backlog or query results page. You can also do a bulk update using the associated feature. To delete or restore several work items at the same time, see [Bulk modify work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md).  


<a id="remove"> </a>  

### Remove work items

By changing the **State** of a work item to *Removed*, you effectively remove it from a backlog or board view (product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs, Kanban board, and Taskboards). The *Removed* state corresponds to the **Removed** workflow category state. If you [define custom workflow states](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-workflow.md), any state you map to the **Removed** workflow category state act in a similar way. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of work item form, Change State to Removed.](media/move-change-delete/remove-state.png)  

To cause removed items to not show up in queries, you must add a clause that filters on the **State** field.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

> [!NOTE]  
> The *Removed* state isn't supported with the Basic process. It is only supported with the Agile, Scrum, and CMMI process work item types. The Basic process is available when you add a project to Azure DevOps Services or [Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2097609).

### Delete work items   

Deleted work items won't appear in your backlogs, boards, or queries. Deleted items are moved to a **Recycle Bin** from which you can recover them if needed. To delete a test case, test plan, or other test-related work item types, see [Delete test artifacts](delete-test-artifacts.md).  
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You can delete work items in one of the following ways: 
- From within the work item form
- From the **Work Items** page :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **More Actions** menu
- From the Kanban board card :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: context menu
- From a backlog or query results page.  


1.  To initiate a delete operation: 

	From the work item form, open the work item, choose  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **Actions**, and select **Delete**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Screenshot of work item form, Actions menu, choose Delete.](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-item.png) 
 
	To delete several work items, [multi-select them from a backlog or a query results list](bulk-modify-work-items.md), choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: context menu, and then select **Delete**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Screenshot of backlog multi-select Actions menu, choose Delete.](media/move-change-delete/multi-delete.png) 

	To delete a work item from your Kanban or taskboard, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: context menu for the card and select **Delete**. 
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of Kanban board card context menu, choose Delete.](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-from-kanban-board.png)
	>
1. Confirm you want to actually delete the item(s).

1. You can delete a work item from within the work item form, or by multi-selecting work items from a backlog or query results page.   

	To delete a single work item, open the work item, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **Actions**, and select **Delete**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Screenshot of work item form, Actions menu, Delete option, TFS 2018 version.](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-item.png)  

	To delete several work items, [multi-select them from a backlog or a query results list](bulk-modify-work-items.md). Then, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon and select <strong>Delete</strong>. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Screenshot of List of work items, actions menu, Delete, TFS 2018 version.](media/move-change-delete/multi-delete.png)  

	You can also delete work items from your Kanban or taskboard. 
 
	![Screenshot of Kanban board, Delete work item, TFS 2018 version.](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-from-kanban-board.png)

	Or, you can drag them to the :::image type="icon" source="media/recycle-bin-icon.png" border="false"::: **Recycle bin**. You can only access the **Recycle bin** from the **Work** hub. 

2. Confirm you want to actually delete the item(s).  

	![Confirm delete dialog, TFS 2018 version.](media/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-dialog-tfs.png)

	> [!NOTE]    
	> The Delete work items confirmation dialog for on-premises Azure DevOps may indicate there are auto-delete settings (disabled). There are no settings you can enable or disable. There is only a background process which permanently deletes work items that have been set to delete.

## Restore or destroy work items  

You can't open work items that have been moved to the **Recycle Bin**. Also, you'll only see the **Permanently delete option** if your [Permanently delete work items](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions) project-level permission is set to **Allow**.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You restore deleted work items or permanently delete them from the web portal **Recycle Bin**. 

1. Choose **Boards>Work Items** and then choose the **Recycle Bin**.  
 
	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Screenshot of Boards, Work Items page, Open Recycle bin.](media/move-change-delete/open-recycle-bin-new-nav.png)

	If you don't see the **Recycle Bin** option, choose **More commands &hellip;** and choose it from the menu of options.

1.  A new browser tab opens with the query that lists work items added to the **Recycle Bin**.  

1.	Select the items you want to restore and then choose **Restore**.  

	![Screenshot of Restore selected items.](media/move-change-delete/restore-from-recycle-bin.png) 

	Optionally, you can choose to permanently delete the items.

1.	Confirm your selection.

## Delete or destroy work items from the command line

You can delete or destroy a work item with the [az boards work-item delete](/cli/azure/boards/work-item#az-boards-work-item-delete) command. To get started, see [Get started with Azure DevOps CLI](../../cli/index.md).  

> [!NOTE] 
> You can restore work items you **delete**, but you can't restore work items you choose to **destroy**.

```azurecli 
az boards work-item delete --id
                           [--destroy]
                           [--org]
                           [--project]
                           [--yes] 
``` 

### Parameters 

- **id**: Required. The ID of the work item.
- **destroy**: Optional. Permanently delete this work item.
- **org**: Azure DevOps organization URL. You can configure the default organization using `az devops configure -d organization=ORG_URL`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`. Example: `--org https://dev.azure.com/MyOrganizationName/`.
- **project**: Name or ID of the project. You can configure the default project using `az devops configure -d project=NAME_OR_ID`. Required if not configured as default or picked up using `git config`.
- **yes**: Optional. Don't prompt for confirmation.

#### Example 

The following command permanently deletes the bug with the ID 864 and doesn't prompt you for confirmation.

```azurecli
az boards work-item delete --id 864 --destroy --yes
```

<a id="witadmin-cli" />
 
### Destroy work items from the command line  

Use the `witadmin destroywi` command to permanently remove work items from the data store. A permanent delete means all information in the work tracking data store is deleted and can't be restored nor reactivated.  

> [!NOTE]   
> Deleting work items from the `witadmin` command line is deprecated for TFS 2018.2 and later versions, and not supported for Azure Boards cloud service.  

Open a Command Prompt window where the latest version of Visual Studio is installed and change the directory to where the `witadmin.exe` tool has been installed.  

For example, you would change to the following directory for TFS 2018. (For other versions, see [Remove work items permanently (witadmin destroywi)](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/witadmin/remove-work-items-permanently)).  

`%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2018\Professional\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer`  

On a 32-bit edition of Windows, replace %programfiles(x86)% with %programfiles%.      

The `witadmin` command-line tool installs with any version of Visual Studio or Team Explorer. You can access this tool by installing the [free version of Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).  

- To delete several work items, enter the server name and directory path to the collection. For example:   

	``` CLI
	witadmin destroywi /collection:http://TFSServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /id:12,15,23
	```
- To delete a single work item, enter the ID as shown:  

	``` CLI
	witadmin destroywi /collection:http://TFSServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /id:2003
	```    
::: moniker-end


## Delete and restore processes 

**When you delete a work item, the following actions occur:**

- Generates a new revision of the work item  
- Updates the **Changed By/Changed Date** fields to support traceability  
- Preserves the work item completely, including all field assignments, attachments, tags, and links  
- Causes the work item to become non-queryable and, as such, won't appear in any work tracking experience, query result, or report  
- Updates charts correctly. The CFD, velocity, burndown, and lightweight charts are updated to remove deleted work items  
- Removes work tracking extensions  
- Preserves trend data except for the latest value 
- Removes the work item from the data warehouse/cube similar to as if it was permanently removed.  


**When you restore a work item, the following actions occur:**   

- Causes a new revision of the work item to be made  
- Updates the **Changed By/Changed Date** fields to support traceability   
- Becomes queryable  
- All fields remain unchanged  
- History contains two new revisions, one for deletion, and one for restore  
- Reattaches work tracking extensions  
- Updates charts correctly. The CFD, velocity, burndown, and lightweight charts are updated to include the restored work items  
- Restores trend data  
- Adds the work item back to the data warehouse/cube  
- Sets the area or iteration path fields to the root node if the previous area path or iteration paths were deleted.   


## Use a REST API to delete, restore, and destroy work items
