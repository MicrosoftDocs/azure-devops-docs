# Automate work item state transitions

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Automatically update the state of a work item according to the state of its child tasks. For example, if one task is changed to `Doing`, then the parent gets set to `Doing`. And if all tasks are in `Closed` state, then the parent gets `Closed`.

Rules are established at the team backlog level and are applicable to all work items at that specific level. You have the flexibility to establish these rules independently for each backlog level, including stories, features, and epics. For example, you can automate the closure of user stories, but keep features and epics open.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Work item automation rules exclusively pertain to your teamâ€™s workflow on the backlog and boards. Other teams within your project can customize their own rules to align with their specific work processes.

## Set rules

Do the following steps to set team rules for each backlog level. 

> [!NOTE]
> Work items must belong to the same team; when you close a task in a different team or project, it doesn't trigger the closure of the parent item.

1. Sign in to your project (```https://dev.azure.com/{Your_Organization}/{Your_Project}```).

2. Select **Boards** > **Backlogs** > :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/gear_icon.png" border="false"::: **Configure team settings**.

3. Check one or more applicable boxes, which trigger the parent work items on this backlog level, and then select **Save**.

   Work item states are set to automatically transition when child items get updated on your backlog.

**Rules applied to sprint board**

These rules operate seamlessly, regardless of where you make updates to the child items, such as on the sprint board, for example.
