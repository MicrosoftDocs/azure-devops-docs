# Add and update a work item

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You add work items to plan and manage your project. Different types of work items track different types of work&mdash;such as user stories or product backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues. Use work items to describe the work to be done, assign work, track status, and coordinate efforts within your team.  


> [!NOTE]  
> This article shows how to add any type of work item. However, the recommended tool for adding backlog or portfolio items&mdash;such as, user stories, product backlog items, features, or epics&mdash; is to use the backlog or Kanban board to add new items. To learn more, see [Create your backlog](create-your-backlog.md), [Define features and epics](define-features-epics.md) and [Start using your Kanban board](../boards/kanban-quickstart.md). To create test cases and link them to user stories, see [Add, run, and update inline tests](../boards/add-run-update-tests.md) and [Create test plans and test suites](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).
 
For other clients that you can use to add and update work items, see [Best tools for adding, updating, and linking work items](../work-items/best-tool-add-update-link-work-items.md).

## Add a work item 

You can start adding work items once you connect to a project. 


### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

Choose a **Boards** page&mdash;such as **Work Items**, **Boards**, or **Backlogs**. Then choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-add.png" border="false"::: plus icon and select from the menu of options. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Work, add artifact](../../project/navigation/media/add-artifact/add-work-item-query-vert.png)


> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the process chosen when the project was created&mdash;[Agile](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Basic](../get-started/plan-track-work.md), [Scrum](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md),
or [CMMI](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md)&mdash;the types of work items you can create will differ. For example, backlog items may be called user stories (Agile), issues (Basic) product backlog items (Scrum), or requirements (CMMI). All four are similar: they describe the customer value to deliver and the work to be performed.
>
> For an overview of all default processes, see [Choose a process](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md). The Basic process requires Azure DevOps Server 2019.1 or later version.

Enter a title and then save the work item. Before you can change the State from its initial default, you must save it.  

![Agile process, User story work item form](media/add-new-work-item-vsts-user-story.png)  

You can [add tags to any work item to filter backlogs and queries](../queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md).

Work items you add are automatically scoped to your team's default area path and iteration path. To change the team context, see [Switch project or team focus](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md).

That's it! 

Create as many work items as you need of the type you need to track the work you want to manage.

    > [!NOTE]  
    >Depending on the process chosen when the project was created&mdash;[Agile](../work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](../work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), 
    or [CMMI](../work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md)&mdash;the types of work items you can create will differ. For example, backlog items may be called user stories (Agile), product backlog items (Scrum), or requirements (CMMI). All three are similar: they describe the customer value to deliver and the work to be performed.

    > For an overview of all three processes, see [Choose a process](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md). 

    Choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/pin-icon.png" border="false":::  pin icon to have it show up within **Work** drop down menu. 

3. Enter a title and then save the work item. Before you can change the State from its initial default, you must save it.  

    ![Agile process, User story work item form](media/add-new-work-item-vsts-user-story.png)  

    You can [add tags to any work item to filter backlogs and queries](../queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md).

    Work items you add are automatically scoped to your team's default area path and iteration path.

### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/visual-studio/)

1. Open Visual Studio 2019, Team Explorer, and then choose **Work Items**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Visual Studio, Team Explorer, Choose Work Items](../work-items/media/view-add/open-work-items-vs-te-complete.png) 

    If you don't see the **Work Items** option, you need to connect to a project and not just a repository. From the Connect to a Project dialog. Use **CTRL-Shift** to select your options and then choose **Connect**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Connect to a Project dialog, connect to a Project and Git repository](../work-items/media/view-add/connect-to-a-project-and-github.png)

1. Choose **New Work Item** and select the work item type you want. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Work Items, Add User Story](../work-items/media/view-add/add-user-story-vs-te.png)

    When you work within Visual Studio 2017 or later version, a browser window will open with the work item form to fill out. If you work within Visual Studio 2015 or earlier version, a work item form opens within Visual Studio.

## Update work items as work progresses

As work progresses, team members can update the state and reassign it as needed. While the workflow states differ for different work item types, they usually follow a progression from New or Active to Completed or Done. 

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Update the State of a User Story](media/add-work/update-state.png)   

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

The following image shows the workflow states for a user story. If you want to discard a work item, change the state to Removed, or you can delete it. For details, see [Move, change, or remove a work item](remove-delete-work-items.md).  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

The following image shows the work flow states for a user story. If you want to discard a work item, change the state to Removed, or you can delete it. For details, see [Remove or delete a work item](remove-delete-work-items.md).    

::: moniker-end

:::row:::
   :::column span="2":::
      **Typical workflow progression:**
      - The product owner creates a user story in the **New** state with the default reason, **New user story**   
      - The team updates the status to **Active** when they decide to complete the work during the sprint  
      - A user story is moved to **Resolved** when the team has completed all its associated tasks and unit tests for the story pass.  
      - A user story is moved to the **Closed** state when the product owner agrees that the story has been implemented according to the Acceptance Criteria and acceptance tests pass.  
    
**Atypical transitions**: 
      - Change the State from **Active** to **New**.  
      - Change the State from **Resolved** to **Active**.  
      - Change the State from **Resolved** to **New**.  
      - Change the State from **Closed** to **Active**.  
      - Change the State from **New** to **Removed**.  
      - Change the State from **Removed** to **New**.  
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="2":::
      ![User story workflow, Agile process](../work-items/guidance/media/alm_pt_agile_wf_userstory.png)  
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Removed work items remain in the data store and can be reactivated by changing the State.   

With each update, changes are recorded in the History field, which you can view through the **History** tab.  

![View change history](media/add-work-item-history.png)  

To find work items based on their history, see [History & auditing](../queries/history-and-auditing.md).

## Follow a work item

When you want to track the progress of a single work item, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/follow-icon.png" border="false"::: follow icon. This action signals the system to notify you when changes are made to the work item.   

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Work item form, Follow icon control](../work-items/media/follow-work/follow-work-item.png) 

You'll only receive notifications when other project members modify the work item, such as adding to the discussion, changing a field value, or adding an attachment. 

Notifications are sent to your preferred email address, which [you can change from your user profile](../../notifications/change-email-address.md).  

To stop following changes, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/following-icon.png" border="false":::  following icon.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To support the follow feature, [you must configure an SMTP server](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) in order for team members to receive notifications.
