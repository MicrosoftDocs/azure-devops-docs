# Bulk move work items and change the work item type in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2019](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Often you find that someone created a work item of the wrong work item type (WIT) or within an incorrect project. You can correct these issues for individual work items or bulk modify several work items. You can also remove work items added to your backlog or taskboard that aren't relevant anymore.  

> [!TIP]
> For TFS 2018 and earlier versions, you can't change the work item type for an existing work item, but you can [copy the work item and specify a new type](copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone). Also, if you have several work items with type changes you want to make, you can [export them using Excel](office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md), and then re-add them as a new type. 

To remove, delete, or restore deleted work items, see [Remove, delete, or restore work items](remove-delete-work-items.md). 

In this article you'll learn:

> * How to move one or more work items to another project     


> [!TIP]  
> From the web portal, you can [multi-select several work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md) from a backlog or query results page and perform a bulk update using the associated feature.  To change, move, delete, or restore several work items at the same time, see [Bulk modify work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md). 


## Prerequisites

	> [!IMPORTANT]  
	> You can change the work item type or move work items to another project within a project collection. These features require that the data warehouse is disabled. With the data warehouse disabled, you'll use the [Analytics Service](../../report/powerbi/what-is-analytics.md) to support your reporting needs. To learn more about disabling the data warehouse, see [Disable the data warehouse and cube](/previous-versions/azure/devops/report/admin/disable-data-warehouse).

## Change the work item type 

Changing the work item type refreshes the work item form with the fields defined for the type selected. For example, you can change a bug to a task and the form will refresh with the fields defined for a task. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You can't change the work item type if the project is defined on a collection that uses the On-premises XML process model. Also, you can't change the work item type of work items associated with test management. 

You can change a single work item or several [multi-selected work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md) to a new type. 

1. Open a work item, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon, and select the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/change-type-icon.png" border="false"::: **Change type...** option. 

	![Work item form, Change work item type menu option](media/move-change-delete/change-work-item-type.png)  

	Or, from the backlog or query results page, multi-select several work items whose type you want to change. You can select several work items of the same type or different type so long as you want to change them all to the same work item type.  

	Choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon,  and select the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/change-type-icon.png" border="false"::: **Change type...** option.     

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Backlog, multi-select, open actions menu, choose Change type option](media/move-change-delete/change-type-new-nav.png)  

	> [!IMPORTANT]   
	> From the **Query Results page**, the **Change type&hellip;** option becomes unavailable if you have checked the Query Editor's **Query across projects** checkbox. 

1. Select the type and optionally enter a comment.  

	![Change work item type dialog](media/move-change-delete/change-work-item-type-dialog.png)    

	Comments are automatically added to the [**Discussion** control](../work-items/work-item-form-controls.md#discussion) and an entry is made to the **History** control. Also, the system automatically resets the State and Reason fields to the default initial values for the work item type that you move.  

2. Save the work item(s) to complete the change.  
 
	> [!NOTE]     
	> The system automatically resets the **State** and **Reason** fields to the default initial values of the specified type. However, in some cases you may need to open the work item to change the **State** or **Reason** field to a value supported by the changed-to work item type.

	From the **Query Results** page, save all work items that you bulk-modified. When you bulk modify items from the backlog, they're automatically saved. Work items shown in bold text indicate that local changes haven't yet been saved to the data store. The system automatically saves each work item. Refresh the page to reflect your changes.

## Move a work item to another project  

When you discover that a work item belongs to a different project within your organization or collection, you can move it where it belongs. You can move a single work item or several [multi-selected work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md).  

Note the following: 
- You can only move work items from one project to another project within the organization or collection. 
- You can only move work items whose type exists in the project you're moving it to. For example, you can't move User Stories to a project based on the Scrum process that doesn't contain User Story as a work item type. 
- You can't move work items associated with test management. 
- To move work items to another project, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group or be [granted explicit permissions to move work items](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions).
- Users granted **Stakeholder** access don't have access to this feature even if granted permission.  

1. Open the work item and choose the ![Move work item icon](../media/icons/change-team-project-icon.png) **Move...** option from the work item form's ![Action icon](../media/icons/actions-icon.png) Actions menu.    

	If you don't see the option, then you haven't been granted [permissions to move work items out of the project](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions).  

	Or, from the backlog or query results page, multi-select several work items that you want to move to another project. You can select several work items so long as you want to move them all to the same project. 

	Choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon to open the context menu of one of the selected work items, and choose the ![Move work item icon](../media/icons/change-team-project-icon.png) **Move&hellip;** option. 

2. Select the destination project and choose the other options available, including changing the work item type. Optionally enter a comment.

	:::image type="content" source="media/move-change-delete/move-work-item-change-type-dialog.png" alt-text="Move work item type and change type dialog.":::

	![Move work item type dialog, on-premises.](media/move-change-delete/move-work-item-dialog.png)
	::: moniker-end

	> [!NOTE]
	> Child work items are not moved. They remain in the origin project, but the Parent-Child links remain in place.

	Comments are automatically added to the [**Discussion** control](../work-items/work-item-form-controls.md#discussion) and an entry is made to the **History** control. Also, the system automatically resets the State and Reason fields to the default initial values for the work item type that you move.
