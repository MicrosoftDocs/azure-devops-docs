# Copy a list of work items  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

<a id="html"></a>

You can copy an HTML formatted table of selected items from either a backlog page or query results list. You can then email this list using your choice of email client, or paste into a Word document, Excel spreadsheet, or other application. 
 
::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!TIP]  
>The data copied with **Copy to clipboard** is the same as that copied when you select **Email ...**.  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"  

> [!TIP]  
>The data copied with **Copy as HTML** is the same as that copied when you select **Email selected work items**. If you don't have an SMTP server configured, you can work around this by using **Copy as HTML**. For on-premises TFS, all email actions require an [SMTP server to be configured](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts).

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"

1. From the web portal, open a backlog or query results page, and [multi-select the work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md#multi-select) you want to copy to the clipboard. 

2. Open the &hellip; context menu of one of the selected work items, and then choose **Copy to clipboard** or **Copy as HTML**. 

	Here we multi-select from the product backlog and choose **Copy to clipboard**.

## Paste the contents into your email client

Once you've copied your list, you can optionally paste the contents of the clipboard into your email client or other application. To open a linked work item, requires users to have read access to the project or area node for those work items. 

The formatted table contains a link to each work item included in your selected results list. A link to a query that will open only those work items selected is also provided.</p>
