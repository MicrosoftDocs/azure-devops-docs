> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Deleting **Area Paths** or reconfiguring **Iteration Paths** can cause a loss of data and can't be reverted. For example, burndown or burnup widget charts, sprint burndown, and velocity charts for teams whose **Area Paths** are changed won't reflect correct data. Historical trend charts reference the **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** as defined at a point in the past for each work item. When an **Area Path** or **Iteration Path** is deleted, then the historical data for it can't be retrieved.
