> [!TIP]
> With Azure DevOps Server, you can choose between using the Inherited process model or the On-premises XML process model. For details, see [Customize your work tracking experience, Choose the process model for your project collection](../../reference/customize-work.md#choose-the-process-model-for-your-project-collection). To access the latest versions of the default processes/process templates: 
> - **For Inherited process model**: Open the Process page from organizations settings. To learn more, see [Manage processes](../../organizations/settings/work/manage-process.md).
> - **For the On-premises XML process model**:   
>    - [Install or upgrade to the latest version of Azure DevOps Server](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 
>    - Download the zipped template file using the [Process Template Manager](../work-items/guidance/manage-process-templates.md). You'll need to use a version of Visual Studio that is at the same version level as Azure DevOps Server. You can install the latest version of [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for free. 
>    - You can access the latest versions of the default process templates installed on Azure DevOps Server, for example: `%programfiles%/Azure DevOps Server 2020/Tools/Deploy/ProcessTemplateManagerFiles/1033`. For descriptions of each file and folder, see [Overview of process template files](../../reference/process-templates/overview-process-template-files.md).
