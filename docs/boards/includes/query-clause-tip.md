> [!TIP]  
> To understand how `AND/OR` clauses are grouped, see [Create and save managed queries, Group clauses](../queries/using-queries.md#group-clauses). To view the WIQL syntax for a query, install the [WIQL query editor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor) which allows you to see the WIQL version of any query editor entry.
