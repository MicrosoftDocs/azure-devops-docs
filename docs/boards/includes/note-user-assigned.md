> [!NOTE]   
> You can only assign work to a single user. If you need to assign work to more than one user, add a work item for each user and distinguish the work to be done by title and description. The Assigned To field only accepts user accounts that have been [added to a project or team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md).
