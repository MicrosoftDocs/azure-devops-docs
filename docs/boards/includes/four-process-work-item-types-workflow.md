#### [Agile process](#tab/agile-process) 

The following images show the Agile process backlog work item hierarchy and workflow states. User Stories and Tasks are used to track work, Bugs track code defects, and Epics and Features are used to group work under larger scenarios. As works progresses from not started to completed, you update the State workflow field from **New**, **Active**, **Resolved**, and **Closed**.

When you add a user story, bug, task, or feature, you create a work item. 
Add epics to track significant business initiatives. Add features to track specific applications or set of work. Define user stories to track work that you'll assign to specific team members, and bugs to track code defects. Lastly, use tasks to track even smaller amounts of work for which you want to track time either in hours or days.

Each team can configure how they manage Bugs&mdash;at the same level as User Stories or Tasks&mdash;by configuring the [Working with bugs](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog) setting. To learn more about using these work item types, see [Agile process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process).

#### [Basic process](#tab/basic-process) 

The following images show the Basic process backlog work item hierarchy and workflow states. Issues and Tasks are used to track work, while Epics are used to group work under larger scenarios. As works progresses from not started to completed, you update the State workflow field from **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done**.

When you add an issue, task, or epic, you create a work item. Add epics to track significant features or requirements. Use issues to track user stories, bugs, or other smaller items of work. And, use tasks to track even smaller amounts of work for which you want to track time either in hours or days.

The Basic process is available with [Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2097609) and later versions. To learn more about using these work item types, see [Plan and track work](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/plan-track-work).

#### [Scrum process](#tab/scrum-process) 

The following images show the Scrum process backlog work item hierarchy and workflow states. Product Backlog Items and Tasks are used to track work, Bugs track code defects, and Epics and Features are used to group work under larger scenarios. As works progresses from not started to completed, you update the State workflow field from **New**, **Approved**, **Committed**, and **Done**.

When you add a product backlog item, bug, task, or feature, you create a work item. Each team can configure how they manage bugs&mdash;at the same level as Product Backlog Items or Tasks&mdash;by configuring the [Working with bugs](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog) setting. To learn more about using these work item types, see [Scrum process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process).  

#### [CMMI process](#tab/cmmi-process) 

The following images show the CMMI process backlog work item hierarchy and workflow states. Requirements and Tasks are used to track work, Bugs track code defects, and Epics and Features are used to group work under larger scenarios. As works progresses from not started to completed, you update the State workflow field from **Proposed**, **Active**, **Resolved**, and **Closed**.

When you add a requirement, bug, task, or feature, you create a work item. Each team can configure how they manage bugs&mdash;at the same level as Requirements or Tasks&mdash;by configuring the [Working with bugs](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog) setting. To learn more about using these work item types, see [CMMI process](/azure/devops/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process).
