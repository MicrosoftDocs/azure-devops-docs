> [!NOTE]   
> New projects no longer define a default set of Shared Queries at the time of project creation. The definitions for Shared Queries have been removed from the process template. For on-premises deployments, you can add them to a custom process template as described in [Add work item queries to a process template](/azure/devops/reference/process-templates/add-work-item-queries-process-template).
