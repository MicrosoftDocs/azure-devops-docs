> [!NOTE]   
> When you create a new project, there's no longer a default set of **Shared Queries**. The definitions for **Shared Queries** were removed from the process template. For on-premises deployments, you can add them to a custom process template as described in [Add work item queries to a process template](/previous-versions/azure/devops/reference/process-templates/add-work-item-queries-process-template).
