To perform the following tasks, you must define area paths: 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"

- [Query and chart work items based on Area Path](../queries/query-by-area-iteration-path.md)
- [Assign work to more than one team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md) 
- [Work with management and feature teams](../plans/configure-hierarchical-teams.md)
- [Filter a backlog, query, board, or plan using Area Paths](../backlogs/filter-backlogs-boards-plans.md)

::: moniker range="< tfs-2017"

- [Query and chart work items based on Area Path](../queries/query-by-area-iteration-path.md)
- [Assign work to more than one team, Add teams](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md) 
- [Work with management and feature teams, Configure a hierarchy of teams](../plans/configure-hierarchical-teams.md)

::: moniker-end

> [!TIP]    
> You can define your area path structure and assign area paths to teams. Or, you can add a team and create the area path with the team name at that time. If teams are fully independent, create a flat set of area paths. However, if you want to create a hierarchy of teams, then you'll want to create a tree-hierarchy of area paths. To learn more, see [Configure a hierarchy of teams](../plans/configure-hierarchical-teams.md).

To use the following tools, teams must subscribe to area paths: 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

- [Boards> all tools](/azure/devops/boards/kanban-overview)  
- [Backlogs> all tools](../backlogs/backlogs-overview.md)  
- [Sprints> all tools](../sprints/scrum-overview.md) 
- [Delivery plans](../plans/review-team-plans.md), calendar view of team deliverables
- [Rollup](/azure/devops/configure-customize#rollup)  
- [Analytics> all](../../report/dashboards/overview.md#in-context-reports-work-tracking)
