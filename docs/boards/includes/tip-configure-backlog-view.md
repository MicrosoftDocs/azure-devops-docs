> [!TIP]  
> Each team member has several tools to configure their backlog view: **Expand/Collapse one level**, **Column Options**, **Backlog level selector**, **View options**, and **Filter** toolbar. Options set for each backlog level are distinct and persist until changed. For more information, see [Configure your backlog view](../backlogs/configure-your-backlog-view.md).
