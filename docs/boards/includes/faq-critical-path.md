### Q: How do I create a view of the critical path? 

**A:** Azure DevOps doesn't provide a native view of the critical path. In part, as Agile methodologies favor a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) over Critical Path Management (CPM). By using MVP, you identify the shortest path and dependencies by prioritizing epics, features, stories and tasks.

That said, you may find that one or more of the following features supports both CPM and MVP. You gain access to these features by installing a Marketplace extension.
 
- [Delivery Plans](/azure/devops/boards/plans/review-team-plans)
- [Feature Timeline](/azure/devops/boards/extensions/feature-timeline)  
- [Dependency Tracker](/azure/devops/boards/extensions/dependency-tracker)  

If your organization supports connection to Microsoft Project, you may find additional [Marketplace extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Boards&sortBy=Relevance) that support connection of Azure DevOps to Microsoft Project.  

For additional context, see [The Critical Path on Agile Projects](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-critical-path-on-agile-projects) and [Running a lean startup on Azure DevOps](https://medium.com/@giladkhen/running-a-lean-startup-on-azure-devops-5934ced2cc42).
