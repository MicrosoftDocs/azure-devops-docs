## Portfolio backlog requirements 

Both Feature Time and Epic Roadmap require at least two levels of portfolio backlogs to be useful. These levels typically correspond to Features and Epics, as defined by the Agile, Scrum, and CMMI default  processes. The Basic process only defines the Epics portfolio backlog. 

If you customize your portfolio backlogs to remove or disable a portfolio backlogs, then you may find that you have limited usage of the Feature Time and Epic Roadmap views. 

If you rename or edit the work items defined for a portfolio backlog, the Feature Timeline and Epic Roadmap views still work. Note the labels on each view remain Features and Epics.  

- The label for the first portfolio backlog level  remains as Features, for example, **Closed Features**. 
- The label for the second portfolio backlog level remains as Epics, for example **Epic** drop-down menu.  

In order to define Epics and Features from the team backlogs or boards, they must be selected through the team settings. For details, see [Select backlog navigation levels for your team](../../organizations/settings/select-backlog-navigation-levels.md).
