::: moniker range="azure-devops"

> [!NOTE]   
> Completed or closed work items don't display on the backlogs and boards once their **Changed Date** is greater than 183 days (about a half a year). You can still list these items using a query. If you want them to show up on a backlog or board, then you can make a minor change to them which resets the clock.
