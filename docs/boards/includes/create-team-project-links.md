Before you start tracking work, you must have a project. To create one, see [Create a project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md).   

If you have a project, start tracking work:  

- [Add work items to manage a project](../backlogs/add-work-items.md) - to gain more familiarity with the work item form features  
- [Create a backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md) - to develop your product backlog  
- [Kanban](../boards/kanban-basics.md)  - to start working in Kanban   
- [Plan a sprint](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) - to start working in Scrum    
- [Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md) - to create a work breakdown structure
