### Analytics widgets and Power BI reports 

The Analytics Service can answer quantitative questions about the past or present state of your projects. You can add [Analytics widgets](../../report/dashboards/analytics-widgets.md) to a dashboard or use [Power BI to create charts and reports](../../report/powerbi/data-connector-connect.md). 

To learn more, see [What is the Analytics Service?](../../report/powerbi/what-is-analytics.md)
