::: moniker range="azure-devops"

- [Assign work items to sprints using the Planning pane](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md)
- [Query and chart work items based on Iteration Path](../queries/query-by-area-iteration-path.md)
- [Forecast your product backlog](../sprints/forecast.md)
- [Sprints> all tools](../sprints/scrum-overview.md) 
- [Delivery Plans, a calendar view of team deliverables](../plans/review-team-plans.md)  
- [Velocity chart](../../report/dashboards/team-velocity.md) and [Sprint burndown chart](../../report/dashboards/configure-sprint-burndown.md)  

::: moniker-end
