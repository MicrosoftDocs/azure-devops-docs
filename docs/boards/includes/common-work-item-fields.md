## Definitions for common work tracking fields  

<a id="definitions-in-common"></a>

The following fields and tabs appear in most work items. Each tab gets used to track specific information, such as :::image type="icon" source="../backlogs/media/icon-history-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: **History**, :::image type="icon" source="../backlogs/media/icon-links-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: **Links**, or :::image type="icon" source="../backlogs/media/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: **Attachments**. These three tabs provide a history of changes, view of linked work items, and ability to view and attach files.  

The only required field for all work item types is **Title**. When you save a work item, the system assigns it a unique **ID**. The form highlights required field in yellow. For information about other fields, see [Work item field index](../work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).   

> [!NOTE]   
> Additional fields may be required depending on customizations made to your process and project.
