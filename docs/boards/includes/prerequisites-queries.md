## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

* By default, all project members and users with **Stakeholder** access can view and run all shared queries. You can change the permissions set for a shared query folder or shared query. For details, see [Set query permissions](../queries/set-query-permissions.md).  
* To add and save a query under **Shared queries**, you must be granted **Basic** access or higher. Also, you must have your **Contribute** permission set to **Allow** for the folder you want to add the query to. By default, the **Contributors** group doesn't have this permission. 


> [!NOTE]  
> Users with **Stakeholder** access for a public project have full access to query features just like users with **Basic** access. For details, see [Stakeholder access quick reference](../../organizations/security/stakeholder-access.md).
