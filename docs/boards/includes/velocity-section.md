## Velocity

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

When you assign your backlog items to sprints, you gain access to an in-context velocity report for both product and portfolio backlogs. Velocity helps teams determine how much work they can perform sprint-over-sprint.

You can configure the Velocity report to count work items or sum Story Points, Effort, Remaining Work or other numeric field.
