While you can create a hierarchy of backlog items, tasks, and bugs&mdash;we don't recommend that you create same-category hierarchies. In other words, don't create parent-child links among work items of the same type, such as story-story, bug-bug, or task-task. The last node in a same-category hierarchy may only appear on Kanban boards, sprint backlogs, and Taskboards. For example, if you link items within a same-category hierarchy that is four levels deep, only the items at the fourth level appear on the Kanban board, sprint backlog, and taskboard.  

Rather than nest requirements, bugs, and tasks, we recommend that you maintain a flat list. Only create parent-child links one level deep between items that belong to a different category. For more information, see [Fix re-ordering and nesting issues, How backlogs and boards display hierarchical (nested) items](../backlogs/resolve-backlog-reorder-issues.md#leaf-nodes).
