## Prerequisites

Backlogs are automatically created when you create a project or add a team. Each team has access to their own product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs as described in [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md#each-team-gets-their-own-set-of-tools).

* You must connect to a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](../get-started/sign-up-invite-teammates.md). 
* You must be added to a project as a member of the **Contributors** or **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, [Add users to a project or team](../../organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). 
* To add or modify work items, you must be granted **Stakeholder** access or higher. For details, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md).
* To view or modify work items, you must have your **View work items in this node** and **Edit work items in this node** permissions set to **Allow**.  By default, the **Contributors** group has this permission set. To learn more, see [Set permissions and access for work tracking](../../organizations/security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> Users with **Stakeholder** access for a public project have full access to backlog and board features just like users with **Basic** access. For details, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md).
