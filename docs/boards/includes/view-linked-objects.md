## View list of linked objects  

To view the list of all objects linked to a work item, open the work item and choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/icon-links-tab-wi.png" border="false"::: **Links** tab. The links tab indicates the count of all linked objects.

Linked objects are grouped under their link type, with a count within each group. You can expand or collapse each group, and sort within each group by **State**, **Latest Update**, or **Comment** by choosing the corresponding column title. 

For example, the following **Links** tab shows a portion of the 64 linked objects for a work item.

Links prefaced with the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/required-icon.png" border="false"::: red exclamation mark indicate that the build, release, or other object has been deleted. This is usually due to retention policies which automatically delete these objects after a certain time period has passed.
