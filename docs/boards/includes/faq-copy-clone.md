### Q: How do I copy or clone a work item with all linked items? 

**A:** This feature isn't supported at this time. Copying a work item doesn't copy any parent-child linked work items. However, this feature is on the roadmap as indicated here: [Roadmap Item 1666194: Clone work item including subtasks](https://dev.azure.com/mseng/AzureDevOpsRoadmap/_backlogs/backlog/Boards/Roadmap%20Items/?workitem=1666194).

The easiest way to accomplish the task of copying many work items with child items, is to create parent-child links to new work items using Excel. To learn how, see [Bulk add or modify work items with Excel, Add a hierarchy of linked work items](/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel#add-a-hierarchy-of-linked-work-items).

Other solutions include employing one of the following Marketplace extensions:  
- [Work item form one click actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mohitbagra.witoneclickactions)  
- [1-Click Child-Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-child-links)  
- [1-Click Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruifig.vsts-work-item-one-click-tasks)
