## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

* You must have a Kanban board you want to configure. When you add a team, you add a Kanban board for that team. To learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings).
* To configure team settings, you must be added to the team administrator role or be a member of the **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, see [Add a team administrator](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/add-team-administrator) or [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions).
* Users assigned **Basic** access or higher can exercise all backlog and board features.  
* Users assigned **Stakeholder** access have limited access to backlog and board features. Stakeholders can edit work items on the board and add existing tags to a work item. They can't add work items to a board and can't update fields displayed on cards. For details, see [About access levels](/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels#access-level-settings).
