## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

* You must have a Kanban board you want to configure. When you add a team, you add a Kanban board for that team. To learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](../../organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).
* To configure team settings, you must be added to the team administrator role or be a member of the **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, see [Add a team administrator](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md) or [Change project-level permissions](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md).
* Users assigned **Basic** access or higher can exercise all backlog and board features.  
* Users assigned **Stakeholder** access have limited access to backlog and board features. Stakeholders can edit work items on the board and add existing tags to a work item. They can't add work items to a board and can't update fields displayed on cards. For details, see [About access levels](../../organizations/security/access-levels.md#access-level-settings).
