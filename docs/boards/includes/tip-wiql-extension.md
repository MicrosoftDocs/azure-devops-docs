> [!TIP]
> To view the WIQL syntax for a query, and how parenthesis are used to group clauses, install the [Marketplace Wiql Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor). This extension supports viewing the WIQL syntax and exporting it to a WIQL file for use in REST API calls. To learn more, see [Syntax for the Work Item Query Language (WIQL)](/azure/devops/boards/queries/wiql-syntax).
