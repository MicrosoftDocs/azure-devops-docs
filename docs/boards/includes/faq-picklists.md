### Q: How do I change the picklist of values? 

**A:** Picklist value entries are dependent on the data type. Refer to the following articles based on the field type of interest:  
- **Numeric or string picklist fields**: You can customize the menu values for fields such as [Priority](~/boards/queries/planning-ranking-priorities.md), [Activity](~/boards/queries/query-numeric.md), [Discipline](~/boards/queries/query-numeric.md), and so on. See [Add and manage fields (Inherited process)](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md) or [Add or modify a field, customize a picklist (On-premises XML process)](../../reference/add-modify-field.md).  
- **Area Path or Iteration Path**: These tree-path fields are configured for each project. To learn more, see [About area and iteration (sprint) paths](../../organizations/settings/about-areas-iterations.md).  
- **Person-name or Identity fields**: To add values for fields associated with user accounts such as Assigned To, [add users to a project security group or a team](~/organizations/security/add-users-team-project.md). By default, the list for these fields contain the account names for all users and groups that have been added to your organization or on-premises collection. These accounts are often synchronized with Active Directory or Azure Active Directory. See [Add AD/Azure AD users or groups to a built-in security group](../../organizations/security/add-ad-aad-built-in-security-groups.md).
