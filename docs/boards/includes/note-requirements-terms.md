<a id="requirements"></a> 

> [!NOTE]
> *Requirements* specify expectations of users for a software product. In Azure Boards, requirements are defined by work items that appear on your product backlog. They correspond to user stories (Agile), product backlog items (Scrum), issues (Basic), or requirements (CMMI) based on the process selected for your project. They also belong to the Requirements category, which manages the work item types that appear on the product backlog.
