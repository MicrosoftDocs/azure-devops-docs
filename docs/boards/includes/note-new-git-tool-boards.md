> [!NOTE]   
> Visual Studio 2019 now includes a new Git tool that provides an improved experience when connecting to a Git repository. When you enable this tool, the Team Explorer tool is effectively disabled when connected to a Git repository.  You can acquire the new tool by downloading [Visual Studio 2019 version 16.6](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-v16.6). To enable and use the new tool, see [Git experience in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/git-with-visual-studio).
