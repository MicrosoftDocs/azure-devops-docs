# Use the Dependency Tracker extension

[!INCLUDE [version-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

> [!NOTE]   
> We recommend that you use [Delivery Plans](../plans/track-dependencies.md) to track dependencies instead of Dependency Tracker. The Dependency Tracker extension is not a supported feature of Azure Boards and isn't supported by any product team. For questions, suggestions, or issues you have when using the extension, visit the [Marketplace for Azure DevOps, Dependency Tracker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-eswm.dependencytracker&ssr=false#overview) page. The Dependency Tracker extension is only available on Azure DevOps Services. 

The Dependency Tracker extension helps you manage dependencies across teams, projects, and organizations. It provides filterable views to show all dependencies a team is consuming and producing. These views allow you to track the state and schedule of dependencies to support you in assessing the risk of dependencies to product deliverables. 
 
Use the Dependency Tracker to plan dependencies at the beginning of an iteration or release, and to track the status during development. For any given dependency, the following parties are involved: 
- **Consumer**: Feature team that has a need and starts a request for work.
- **Producer**: Feature team that makes a commitment to deliver work. 

Each work request and work deliverable is defined as a work item. The work items get linked by the Successor-Predecessor link type or other directional link type. For more information, see [Link type reference](../queries/link-type-reference.md) 
Producing for/Consuming from link.

> [!TIP]   
> While any work item type can participate in dependency tracking, you might want to limit dependencies to specific types, such as Features, Epics, User Stories, or Bugs. You can create the restriction by [configuring Dependency Tracker](#configuration).

From the Dependency Tracker, you can choose different views and filters, and drill down to obtain specific details. These views and options are described in the following sections: 
- [Filter options](#filter)
- [Drill-down](#drill-down)
- [Consuming Dependencies](#consume)
- [Producing Dependencies](#produce)
- [Timeline](#timeline)
- [Risk Graph](#risk-graph)

## Recommended use and key terms

Use Dependency Tracker to visualize and track the following work items: 
- Dependencies on deliverables for work that your team is delivering.  
- Dependencies you have on other teams for work that your team is delivering.
- Dependencies that other teams have on work your team is delivering. 

All teams across organizations can participate in tracking dependencies. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Dependency Tracker doesn't replace the in-person interactions that are required to agree to doing the work. It provides easier planning and tracking capabilities. Dependencies should be agreed upon by all parties before they enter into the Dependency Tracker.

### Key terms

- **Dependency**: Work that Team A requires from Team B to do the work Team A is trying to do.
- **Consumer**: The team that asks to have work done.
  - The consumer owns the engagement and tracking of that work â€“ since it's the work their scenario requires, the burden is on the consumer to file, monitor, and track the status of the work
  - The consumer owns entering the work into Azure Boards and submitting that work request to the producer
  - The consumer is in charge of managing the work they requested so that they're aware of any material changes and adjustments
- **Producer**: The team that is doing the work.
  - Once the work gets submitted to the producer, the producer owns the work item,
    - The producer is responsible for maintaining the work item in Azure Boards
    - The producer owns the state of the work item and iteration  
    - The consumer shouldn't touch these values once the work item gets handed off
- **Sequencing**: A producing team's work is needed before the consuming team can start their work.

## Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Tools** | [Dependency Tracker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-eswm.dependencytracker&ssr=false#overview) installed for the organization for which you want to track dependencies. |
| **Permissions** | - To view dependencies: Member of the **Project Valid Users** group for the project. <br> - To create a dependency: Member of the **Contributors** group for both projects that participate in the dependency linking. <br> - To modify configuration: Member of the **Project Collection Administrators** group. |
| **Authentication** | All organizations authenticate users through the same [Microsoft Entra ID](../../organizations/accounts/connect-organization-to-azure-ad.md). |
| **Services** | [Azure Boards as a service](../../organizations/settings/set-services.md) enabled. |
| **Configuration and customization tasks** | - Area paths and teams set up to participate in dependency tracking. <br> - Iteration paths/sprints configured for the project and assigned to work items participating in dependency tracking. This requirement is essential for the Timeline view to yield meaningful data. <br> - Customize your process as needed to support any other work items or fields. <br> - [Dependency Tracker](#configuration) configured to support your business needs and address any customizations. |

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The default configuration for Dependency Tracker supports the Agile process. If your project(s) are based on a different process or you have customized your process, you may need to modify the configuration. See [Configure the Dependency Tracker](#configuration) later in this article.

## Open the Dependency Tracker extension

1. Open the web portal for the project where your team is defined.  

2. Select **Boards** > **Dependency Tracker**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot showing Dependency Tracker hub in Azure Boards.](media/tracker/select-dependency-tracker.png)

3. Choose the **Area** that corresponds to the team you want to view dependencies for from the dropdown menu.   

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot showing selecting Area.](media/tracker/choose-area-path.png)

    You can only filter on those Area paths defined for the project. 

<a id="filter"></a> 

## Filter options 

Filter each supported view by entering a keyword or using one or more of the fields. Provided fields include State, Work item type, and Iteration Path. Based on the keyword that you enter, the filter function lists work items based on any displayed column field.  

To show the filter toolbar, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/filter-icon.png" border="false"::: filter icon. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing Dependency Tracker Filter options.](media/tracker/filter.png)  

Toggle filters on and off by choosing the filter icon. To see more filters use the arrows at the end of the list of filters. 

Choose one or more values from the drop-down menu for each field. These fields populate with the following values:

- **Work item type**: Check one or more check boxes for the Work item types you want to view. Work item types configured to participate in dependency tracking. The default work item types are: Epic, Feature, User Story, and Bug. To modify the configuration, see [Configuration of Dependency Tracker](#configuration).
- **State**: Check one or more check boxes for the  work item states you want to view. The drop-down list should include all workflow States defined for all work item types shown in the selected view.  
- **Iteration**: Check one or more check boxes for the Iteration Paths you want to view. The drop-down list should include all Iteration Paths [configured for the project](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md) and for which there are work items listed in the current view.
- **Priority**:  Check one or more check boxes for the Priorities you want to view. The priority values assigned to work items  
- **Partner**: The partner organization for which the work item is defined. 

Your filtering options are dependent on the [configuration](#configuration) defined for the Dependency Tracker and that correspond to work items shown in the selected view that meet the filter criteria. For example, if you don't have any work items assigned to Sprint 4, then the Sprint 4 option doesn't appear in the filter options for the Iteration Path. 

You can drop dependencies within the selected area, which excludes dependencies inside your team.

<a id="drill-down"></a> 

## View drill-down options 

Several views provide interactive visualizations through drill-downs. These features are addressed in the tabbed views descriptions later in this article. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot showing Consuming dependencies, drill-down into completed work in an area.](media/tracker/drill-down-completed-consuming.png) 

<a id="create"></a> 

## Create a dependency 

A dependency represents work where one team is dependent on another team. Both teams should track their own work in their own area path. By linking the work that is dependent on the other teams work, the dependencies can be visualized and tracked.  

1. Select **New Dependency**.  

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot showing choose New Dependency.](media/tracker/choose-new-dependency.png)

    If the partner team is in a different organization, then first choose the **Partner Account**. The Partner Account option can be enabled or disabled by [configuring the Dependency Tracker](#configuration).   

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of Create dependency dialog, Choose partner account.](media/tracker/choose-partner-organization.png)

2.  Search for work items by ID or enter a keyword contained within the work item title. In the following example, we link a user story and a bug. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of Create dependency dialog, choose two existing work items to link.](media/tracker/create-dependency.png)

    - The Producer is the team that commits to delivering the work.
    - The Consumer is the team that needs or is dependent on the work.
    - The fastest way to create a dependency link is to type the Producer and Consumer work item IDs in the search boxes and then choose **Save**.

    Optionally, you can choose **Create New** to add work items that you then link as dependent upon each other. Here we create two new features and link them. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of Create dependency dialog, create new work items to link.](media/tracker/create-new-work-items-link-dependency.png)

    If no work items exist for one half of the dependency, you can create a new work item as needed.

3.  Select **Save**. The **Save** button is available only after two work items get chosen to link.      

4. From the success confirmation dialog, select **View dependency**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of Success confirmation dialog.](media/tracker/success-confirmation.png)

   The work items that you linked are highlighted.    
    
    In the following example, the Fabrikam Fiber/Service Delivery/Voice team is dependent on the MyFirstProject team to deliver their `User Story 706: Cancel order form` to complete `Bug 390: Cancel order form`. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Screenshot of Create dependency dialog, Linked dependent work items.](media/tracker/linked-dependent-work-items.png)

## Create links manually 

You can also link work items using the **Links** tab to create Successor/Predecessor links. A Predecessor is the producer of the work item, or the item that must come first. A Successor is the consumer of the work item, or the item that is dependent on the first item.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Add Link dialog, Create links manually.](media/tracker/create-links-manually.png)

> [!NOTE]   
> The Successor/Predecessor (consumes/produces) link types are the default link types used by the Dependency Tracker. If you customized your projects using a Hosted XML process model, it's possible to specify different link types in the Dependency Tracker configuration. For more information, see [Configure the Dependency Tracker](#configuration) later in this article, and [Link user stories, issues, bugs, and other work items](../backlogs/add-link.md). 

## Remove dependency links

You can remove a dependency by choosing the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon from the linked work item and choose **Remove Dependency Link** option from the menu. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of work item list, choose actions menu to remove dependency links.](media/tracker/remove-dependency-link.png)

Optionally, you can remove the link from the work item's **Links** tab. 

## Create a query of dependencies 

To open a set of dependent work items, select them in the same way you would via a [bulk edit](../backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md), choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon from one of the selected linked work items and choose **Open in Query** option from the menu. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of work item list, Create a query of dependencies.](media/tracker/open-as-query.png)

A new tab opens to the Query Results page. 

You can also create a custom query by selecting the Work items and direct links query type and choose any work item type. 

Choose **Copy to HTML** to copy the selected work items to the clipboard as a formatted table. 

<a id="consume"></a>

## Consuming Dependencies view

The **Consuming Dependencies** view shows work that a team is dependent upon by other teams or area paths.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Dependency Tracker, Consuming dependencies view.](media/tracker/consuming-dependencies-view.png)

Each column on the bar chart represents another area path that is producing dependencies by workflow state for the selected **Area View**. The table shows the number of unique dependencies. It also lists all work items participating in the filtered view of tracked dependencies. 

Within the table, you can complete the following actions. 

- Filter the list of work items by choosing one of the area path bars and progress states in the bar chart graph 
- Expand or collapse the list of work items to show the full list of dependent work items using the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/expand_icon.png" border="false"::: expand and :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/collapse_icon.png" border="false"::: collapse icons 
- Add or remove column fields by opening Column Options
- Switch the sequence of work items by choosing the Display: **Consumer on top** or **Producer on top**

<a id="produce"></a>

## Producing Dependencies view

The **Producing Dependencies** view shows work that other teams or area paths are dependent on per the selected area.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Dependency Tracker, Producing dependencies view.](media/tracker/producing-dependencies-view.png)

Each column on the bar chart represents another area path that is consuming dependencies by workflow state for the selected **Area View**. The table shows the number of unique dependencies and lists all work items included in the filtered view of tracked dependencies. 

Within the table, you can complete the same actions as in the Consuming Dependencies view. 
 
 
<a id="timeline"></a>

## Timeline tab

The **Timeline** tab provides a calendar view of dependencies. The Timeline view is in Beta.

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> For the Timeline to show meaningful data, have assigned the dependent work items to Iteration Paths, and the Iteration Paths must have start and end dates assigned.  

There are two versions of the Timeline view: **Correct Flow** and **Incorrect Flow**. Each version shows the color-coded workflow state. You can customize color codes within the [Dependency Tracker configuration](#configuration).

#### Correct Flow view

The Correct Flow view shows those dependencies that are in the correct sequence. Successor work items get completed after their predecessor work item.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Timeline view, correct flow.](media/tracker/timeline-oc-word-2019-correct-flow.png)

#### Incorrect Flow view

The Incorrect Flow  view shows those dependencies that are out of order. At least one predecessor work item gets completed after its successor work item.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Timeline view, incorrect flow.](media/tracker/timeline-oc-word-2019-incorrect-flow.png)


<a id="risk-graph"></a>

## Risk Graph

The Risk Graph provides a visualization of how dependencies flow from Consumer team to Producer team, or from Producer to Consumer. The graph lets a team understand the number of dependencies and level of risks associated at a glance. Also, the risk graph view demonstrates the value of linking dependencies and laddering them up to Stories. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Dependency Tracker Risk Graph.](media/tracker/risk-graph-1.png)

There are two views: **Consuming From** and **Producing For**. The workflow state color coding is configurable. The width of the lines indicates how many dependencies exist in that area, the thicker the link the more dependencies as indicated in the legend.

#### Consuming From

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Dependency Tracker Risk Graph, Consuming From view.](media/tracker/risk-graph-ff-consuming-from.png)

#### Producing For

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Dependency Tracker Risk Graph, Producing For view.](media/tracker/risk-graph-ff-producing-for.png)


#### Filtered on a specific dependency

You can drill down into specifics by choosing one of the dependencies. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Screenshot of Dependency Tracker Risk Graph, Producing For, Filtered on a dependency.](media/tracker/risk-graph-ff-producing-for-filtered.png)


<a id="configuration"></a> 

## Configure the Dependency Tracker

Be a member of the  Project Collection Administrator Group to modify the configuration. All changes to the configuration apply to all projects defined in the organization. 

To change the configuration, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-gear.png" border="false":::  gear icon  and modify the syntax listed. Choose **Save** when you're done. 

The main properties you can modify are summarized as follows: 
- The link types to use to create dependency links. Defaults are the Successor/Predecessor link types. Only customize when you use the [Hosted XML process model](../../organizations/settings/work/hosted-xml-process-model.md) to customize work tracking.  
- Work items and work item types
    - Work item types to participate in dependency tracking 
    - Mapping of work item category states to colors 
    - Mapping of work item workflow states and colors
- Default field columns in dependency list tables
- Default filter selections:
    - Selected dependency work item types
    - Selected Iteration Paths
- Enabled options:
    - Timeline
    - New Dependency link 
    - Cross account (organization) dependencies 
    - Cross account dependency toggle default state 
- Risk graph configuration:
    - Work item states associated with at risk (Red color) work items
    - Work item states associated with neutral (Gray color) work items
    - Work item states associates with on track (Green color) work items

For a full list and description, see the [Property descriptions](#table) provided later in this section. 

### Enable or disable the New Dependency option

The `newDependencyButtonEnabled` property enables or disables the **New Dependency** link option. When enabled, the link appears on the Dependency Tracker page. When disabled, users can't create dependencies from the tracker, only review the dependencies created through other means. The default value is set to `true` (enabled).  

### Enable or disable cross-organization linking

The `crossAccountConfigs` property enables or disables cross-organization dependency linking from the New dependency dialog. The default value is set to `true` (enabled).  

To disable, set the following syntax in the JSON configuration to `false`.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```
{
"crossAccountConfigs": {
  "crossAccountDependencyEnabled": false,
  "crossAccountDependencyToggleDefaultState": false, //default state for cross account toggle
  "crossAccountDependencyToggleOnText": "Cross-account dependencies on",
  "crossAccountDependencyToggleOffText": "Cross-account dependencies off"}
}
```

Cross account linking requires the use of a special link type and should only be used in coordination with the **New Dependency** option.

## Dependency Bot

The dependency bot works in the background to notify teams when dependencies are created. These include performing the following actions: 
- Notify the producer (copy the consumer) when a dependency is created
- Notify the consumer (copy the producer) when the producer has changed the State of the deliverable to Cut
- Notify the consumer (copy the producer) when the producer has moved out the iteration path of a committed dependency.
