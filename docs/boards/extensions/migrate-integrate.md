[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You have a choice of tools to help you migrate your work tracking data to the Azure DevOps platform. This article provides an overview of what's available and links to tools that support migration of work tracking data and processes. You can also integrate Azure Boards with many third-party tools. 

## Migrate from an on-premises Azure DevOps server

The data migration tool for Azure DevOps provides a high fidelity way to migrate collection databases from Azure DevOps Server to Azure DevOps Services. To learn more, see [Migrate data from Azure DevOps Server to Azure DevOps Services](../../migrate/migration-overview.md).

## Migrate data between Azure DevOps Projects

The [Azure DevOps Migration Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nkdagility.vsts-sync-migration) marketplace extension allows you to bulk edit and migrate data between Azure DevOps Projects on both on-premises and the cloud. This tool supports the following tasks:  
- Migrate work items from one project to another project and synchronize changes after a migration
- Merge many projects into a single project
- Split one project into many projects
- Assist changing process templates
- Edit work items in bulk
