# 3. Set sprint capacity

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)] 

As a next step, you'll want to determine your team's actual capacity. Whereas velocity correlates to how your team estimates requirements, capacity correlates to actual task time - either hours or days. Capacity takes into consideration the variation in work hours by team members as well as holidays, vacation days, and non-working days. 

Because days off and time available for each team member can vary from sprint to sprint, you can set capacity for each sprint. The capacity tool helps you make sure your team isn't over or under committed for the sprint. Also, as you work day-to-day, you'll be able to see if your team is on track.

> [!div class="checklist"]   
> * Set team capacity for a sprint
> * Copy capacity from the previous sprint to the current sprint  
> * Track capacity when performing multiple activities  
> * Add or remove user accounts from capacity planning for a sprint  
> * Track capacity when working on more than one team  

If you haven't set up sprints yet for your team, go [here to do that now](define-sprints.md).

## Prerequisites

* You must connect to a project. If you don't have a project yet, [create one](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project).
* You must be added to a project as a member of the **Contributors** or **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, [Add users to a project or team](/azure/devops/organizations/security/add-users-team-project).  
* To view or set capacity, you must be granted **Basic** access or higher. For details, see [About access levels](/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels). Users with **Stakeholder** access can't view or set capacity.


## Open a Sprint backlog for a team 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

0. From your web browser, open your product backlog. (1) Check that you have selected the right project, (2) choose **Boards>Sprints**, (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu, and lastly (4), choose **Capacity**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open Work, Sprints, for a team](_img/capacity/open-capacity-agile.png)

	To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose the ![home-icon](../../_img/icons/home-icon.png) **Browse all sprints** option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose another team](_img/add-tasks/team-selector-sprints-agile.png) 

0. To choose a different sprint than the one shown, open the sprint selector and choose the sprint you want. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose another sprint](_img/add-tasks/select-specific-sprint-agile.png)

	The system lists only those sprints that have been selected for the current team focus. If you don't see the sprints you want listed, then choose **New Sprint** from the menu, and then choose **Select existing iteration**. For details, see [Define iteration paths (aka sprints)](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md).

## Set capacity for the team and team members 

From the **Capacity** page, you can add team members, enter the team time off, and set capacity and days off for each team member. If your team tracks capacity by activity, then also select the <strong>Activity</strong> for each team member.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

0. If you don't see your team members listed, add them. Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) action icon and select <strong>Add all team members</strong>. For this feature to work, [team members will have been added to the team](../../organizations/settings/add-teams.md#add-team-members).  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Add team members](_img/capacity/add-team-members.png) 

	> [!NOTE]  
	> The <strong>Add all team members</strong> action will retrieve a maximum of 100 team members. If you have more team members to add, then you can add them one by one by choosing <strong>Add user</strong>.

0. If you need to add other contributors to your project, choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/blue-add-icon.png) <strong>Add user</strong>.  

0. Next, set any time off that the team will take. Choose the <strong>0 days</strong> link as shown.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Add team members](_img/capacity/team-members-added-set-team-days-off.png) 

	In the Days off for the entire team dialog, select the start and end days during the sprint that the team will take off. 

	> [!NOTE]
	> Your sprint planning and tracking tools automatically consider days off when calculating capacity and sprint burndown. You only have to indicate planned days off for the team. You set weekend days or other recurring days off under your team's [Settings, Working days](../../organizations/settings/set-working-days.md) page. 

0. Now, set the **Activity** and **Capacity** per day for each team member. 

	Most teams specify capacity in terms of hours, however, you can also specify it in days. For example, .5 days would correspond to 4 hours for a typical 8 hour day. Choose the same unit you will use to estimate the time a task will take to complete. You only have to indicate planned days off. You [manage weekend days or other recurring days off](../../organizations/settings/set-working-days.md) under team settings.

	For example, Christie Church's capacity is 6 hours/day for design work.

	In the Days off for the entire team dialog, select the start and end days during the sprint that the team will take off. 

	> [!NOTE]
	> Your sprint planning and tracking tools automatically consider days off when calculating capacity and sprint burndown. Leave those days of the week that your team doesn't work unchecked in your team's Settings, [Working days](../../organizations/settings/set-working-days.md) page.

<a id="copy-capacity">  </a>
## Copy capacity planning from the previous sprint 

By copying the capacity from the previous sprint, you save time. With the basics defined, all you have to do is adjust the capacity based on individual and team days off and capacity allocation per activity.  

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]    
> This feature is available from TFS 2015.1 and later versions.

Notice that only the capacity per day and activity are copied over. Individual and team days off remain unset. The copy operation always copies the latest updates made to the previous sprint. So you can repeat the copy operation if you've made changes to the previous sprint that you want to copy to the latest sprint.

> ![Copy capacity, vertical nav](_img/capacity/copy-capacity-from-previous-sprint-vert.png)

::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"

For example, here we choose Sprint 2 and copy the capacity set for Sprint 1.

## Remove a user from capacity 

To remove a user, choose the option from the users ![ ](../../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) action menu.

![Capacity planning, Remove a user](_img/capacity/capacity-planning-remove-user.png) 
::: moniker-end


## Review capacity charts 

As you define tasks and estimate the work, you'll see capacity charts start to fill in for each team member. Capacity bars track the remaining work against the capacity for each team member as well as the entire team.  

You'll also see a roll-up of the remaining work required to complete each requirement or bug.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Wiki view keyboard shortcuts popup](_img/capacity/work-details.png)   
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
![Capacity charts](_img/capacity/review-capacity.png)  
::: moniker-end

From this view, you can easily see which individuals are at or near capacity. Teams can determine if work needs to be moved out of the sprint or to reassign tasks.

> [!TIP]  
> Define tasks that take a day or less to complete. This helps mitigate the risks that come from poor estimates.
>
> Also, don't divide tasks into subtasks. If you do divide a task into subtasks, specify Remaining Work only for the subtasks, as the system rolls up summary values to the parent task.

## Track capacity when performing multiple activities

Because individual team members have different sets of skills and duties, you can track their activity and capacity for each activity and for each sprint. 

Here, Jamal divides his time between Deployment and Development.

::: moniker-end


<a id="track-capacity-per-team">  </a>
## Track capacity when working on more than one team
If you work on more than one team, you'll want to specify your sprint capacity for each team. For example, both Christie and Raisa split their time between the Web and Phone teams. They therefore allocate 3 hours a day to the Web team, and 3 hours a day to the Phone team.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Allocate capacity for team Web](_img/capacity/set-capacity-web-team.png)
<br/>
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Allocate capacity for team Phone](_img/capacity/set-capacity-phone-team.png)
 
If your name isn't listed in the capacity view, you need to be added as a team member.
