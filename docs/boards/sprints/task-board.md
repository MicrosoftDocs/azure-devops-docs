# 6. Update and monitor your Taskboard

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Once you have your [sprint plan](assign-work-sprint.md) in place, you'll execute that plan for the duration of the sprint. In your daily Scrum meetings, your team can view progress made to backlog items and tasks from the sprint taskboard.

Your taskboard provides a visualization of flow and status of each sprint task. With it, you can focus on the status of backlog items as well as work assigned to each team member. It also summarizes the total amount of remaining work to complete for a task or within a column.

In this topic you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Open the sprint taskboard for your team
> * Customize your taskboard
> * Use your taskboard to review progress during daily scrum meetings
> * Filter and group work items on your taskboard
> * Update the status of tasks through drag-and-drop
> * Update remaining work
> * Close out a sprint

If you haven't yet [added tasks to your sprint backlog](add-tasks.md), do that now.

> [!NOTE]
> Your taskboard is one of two types of boards available to you. For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](../backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/prerequisites.md)]

## Open the sprint Taskboard for your team

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

0. From your web browser, open the sprint backlog for your team. (1) Check that you have selected the right project, (2) choose **Boards>Sprints**, (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu, and lastly (4), choose (4) **Taskboard**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Open the sprint Taskboard for a team](_img/taskboard/open-taskboard-agile.png)

	To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose the ![home-icon](../../_img/icons/home-icon.png) **Browse all sprints** option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Choose another team](_img/add-tasks/team-selector-sprints-agile.png)

0. To choose a different sprint than the one shown, open the sprint selector and choose the sprint you want.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Choose another sprint](_img/add-tasks/select-specific-sprint-agile.png)

	The system lists only those sprints that have been selected for the current team focus. If you don't see the sprints you want listed, then choose **New Sprint** from the menu, and then choose **Select existing iteration**. For details, see [Define iteration paths (aka sprints)](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md).

## Customize the taskboard
Each team can customize their taskboard in the following ways:
- [Customize cards](../../boards/boards/customize-cards.md) that appear on the taskboard to show additional fields.
- [Show bugs on the taskboard](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md), your team can choose to manage bugs similar to product backlog items, as shown in this topic, or manage them similar to tasks. When you track bugs similar to tasks, they'll show up on your sprint backlogs and taskboards at the same level as tasks.

::: moniker range="vsts"  
An administrator can customize the taskboard for all teams in the following ways:  
- [Add a custom workflow state to the task WIT for a process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-workflow.md)
- [Add a custom work item type to the taskboard for a process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="azdevserver-2019"
An administrator can customize the taskboard for all teams in the following ways based on the process model selected for the project:
**Inherited process model:**
- [Add a custom workflow state to the task WIT for a process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-workflow.md)
- [Add a custom work item type to the taskboard for a process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)

**On-prem XML process model:** 
- [Add a custom workflow state to the task WIT for a process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-workflow.md)
- [Add a custom work item type to the taskboard for a process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"
An administrator can customize the taskboard for all teams in the following ways:  
- [Modify the workflow for the task WIT definition](../../reference/xml/change-workflow-wit.md).
- [Add a work item type to a backlog or board](../../reference/add-wits-to-backlogs-and-boards.md).

<a id="review-progress">  </a>
## Review progress in daily scrum meetings
During your daily Scrum, you can filter your taskboard to help focus on items of interest.
*	Group by Backlog items or Group by stories to monitor progress of your product backlog items, stories, requirements, or bugs.
*	Group by People when you want to monitor progress of individual team members.

Use the Person filter when you want to focus on work assigned to individual team members.

> [!TIP]
>If you're seeing tasks that don't belong to your team, check that you've [selected the correct team](../../project/navigation/go-to-project-repo.md?toc=/azure/devops/boards/sprints/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/boards/sprints/breadcrumb/toc.json).

<a id="update-tasks">  </a>
## Update tasks during the sprint cycle
The taskboard makes quick work of updating both task status and remaining work.

<a id="update-task-status">  </a>
### Update task status
Simply drag tasks to a downstream column to reflect if they are in progress or completed.

![taskboard, update task status](_img/ALM_TB_Move_To_Done.png)

When you move a task to the Done or Completed column, the system automatically updates the *Remaining Work* field to 0. If you discover more work is remaining, change the State back to In progress or To do and enter a value for the remaining work.

### Update remaining work
Updating *Remaining Work*, preferably prior to the daily Scrum meeting, helps the team stay informed of the progress being made. It also ensures a smoother burndown chart.

Each team member can review the tasks they've worked on and estimate the work remaining. If they've discovered that it's taking longer than expected to complete, they should increase the remaining work for the task. *Remaining Work* should always reflect exactly how much work the team member estimates is remaining to complete the task.

![taskboard, update task remaining work](_img/ALM_TB_UpdateRWork.png)
::: moniker-end

<a id="close-sprint">  </a>
<!--- NEEDS MORE WORK --> 

## Close out a sprint, update your taskboard
At the end of the sprint, you'll want to perform these final tasks:
*	Zero out *Remaining Work* of all completed tasks
*	Update the status of all completed backlog items
*	Move incomplete tasks or backlog items to the next sprint or back to the product backlog.

Dragging an incomplete item to the product backlog or to a future sprint updates the Iteration Path of all uncompleted child tasks to correspond to the product backlog iteration path or future sprint.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
You can [drag-and-drop work items onto a sprint from any backlog or board](assign-work-sprint.md#drag-drop).
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
You can [drag-and-drop work items onto a sprint from any backlog or board](assign-work-sprint.md#drag-drop). Requires TFS 2015.1 or later version.

## Reduce the number of items on the taskboard

If you exceed the number of items allowed on your taskboard, you'll receive a message indicating that you need to reduce the number of items. The maximum number of items includes work item types included in the Requirement and Task categories.

You can reduce the number of items on the taskboard by moving them to the backlog or another sprint. When you move a parent PBI or user story, all active child tasks (State not equal to Done or Closed) automatically move with the parent item.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"

- From the taskboard, drag the PBI or user story from the first column onto the backlog or future sprint. All child tasks automatically move with the parent item.
- From the sprint backlog, multi-select the items to move and then click the context menu for an item and select the iteration to move them to.

![multi-select items from the sprint backlog](_img/sprint-backlog-multi-select-non-sequential-items.png)
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
Requires TFS 2015.1 or later version.
- From the taskboard, drag the PBI or user story from the first column onto the backlog or future sprint. All child tasks automatically move with the parent item.
- From the sprint backlog, multi-select the items to move and then click the context menu for an item and select the iteration to move them to.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2013"
- From the taskboard, drag the PBI or user story from the first column onto the backlog or future sprint.

- From the sprint backlog, drag an item back to the backlog or to another sprint.

	<img src="_img/IC797613.png" alt="Drag items back to product backlog" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />

- If you need to move several items, you can create a query from the sprint backlog and then use the query to [bulk modify the iteration path](../backlogs/bulk-modify-work-items.md).
