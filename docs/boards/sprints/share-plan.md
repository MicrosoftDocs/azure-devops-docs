# 5. Share your sprint plan

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)] 
 
Once you've completed your sprint plan, you can easily share it with other members of your team or organization.  This article shows you how to: 

> [!div class="checklist"]   
> * Create a query from your sprint plan    
> * Email your sprint plan   

Any stakeholder on your team (someone with permissions to connect to your project) can view your sprint plan. Simply send them the URL of your sprint backlog page. But also, you can share it with them through email or print a version.

## Open a Sprint backlog for a team 

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

0. From your web browser, open your product backlog. (1) Check that you have selected the right project, (2) choose **Boards>Sprints**, (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu, and lastly (4), choose **Backlog**.

	To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose the ![home-icon](../../_img/icons/home-icon.png) **Browse all sprints** option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose another sprint](_img/add-tasks/select-specific-sprint-agile.png)

	The system lists only those sprints that have been selected for the current team focus. If you don't see the sprints you want listed, then choose **New Sprint** from the menu, and then choose **Select existing iteration**. For details, see [Define iteration paths (aka sprints)](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md).
