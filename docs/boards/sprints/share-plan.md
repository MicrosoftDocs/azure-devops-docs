# 5. Share your sprint plan

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)] 
 
<a id="share" >  </a>

Once you've completed your sprint plan, you can easily share it with other members of your team or organization.  This article shows you how to: 

> [!div class="checklist"]   
> * Create a query from your sprint plan    
> * Email your sprint plan   

Any stakeholder on your team (someone with permissions to connect to your project) can view your sprint plan. Simply send them the URL of your sprint backlog page. But also, you can share it with them through email or print a version. 


## Open a Sprint backlog for a team 

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. From your web browser, open your product backlog. (1) Check that you have selected the right project, (2) choose **Boards>Sprints**, (3) select the correct team from the team selector menu, and lastly (4), choose **Backlog**. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
    > ![Open Work, Sprints, for a team](_img/add-tasks/open-sprint-backlog-s155-co.png)

   To choose another team, open the selector and select a different team or choose the ![home-icon](../../_img/icons/home-icon.png) **Browse all sprints** option. Or, you can enter a keyword in the search box to filter the list of team backlogs for the project.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Choose another team](_img/add-tasks/team-selector-sprints-agile.png)  

2. To choose a different sprint than the one shown, open the sprint selector and choose the sprint you want. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose another sprint](_img/add-tasks/select-specific-sprint-agile.png)

	The system lists only those sprints that have been selected for the current team focus. If you don't see the sprints you want listed, then choose **New Sprint** from the menu, and then choose **Select existing iteration**. For details, see [Define iteration paths (aka sprints)](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md).

	To choose another team, open the project/team selector and select a different team or choose the **Browse** option. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose another team](_img/assign-items-sprint/team-selector-backlogs-standard.png) 

	The set of sprints selected for your team appears in the left pane. If you don't see any sprints listed, you can add sprints or select existing sprints for your team's use. To learn how, see [Define sprints](define-sprints.md).

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open Column Options](_img/assign-items-sprint/open-work-backlogs-column-options-agile.png) 

1. To email your sprint plan, create and save the query for the sprint backlog. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Choose create query from sprint backlog](_img/share-plan/create-query-agile.png) 

2. Then, open the query and choose the email icon. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
   > ![Email created query from sprint backlog](_img/share-plan/email-query-agile.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT]     
   > You can only send the email to individual address for a project member that is recognized by the system. Adding a team group or security group to the to line isn't supported. If you add an email account that the system doesn't recognize, you receive a message that one or more recipients of your email don't have permissions to read the mailed work items.
