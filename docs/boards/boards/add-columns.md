# Manage columns on your board

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

Managing columns on your board is essential for visualizing your team's workflow. Each column corresponds to a stage of work, such as "To do," "In progress," and "Done." You can customize these columns to match your specific process, while each card on the board represents a work item, such as a user story, bug, or task.

## Add and edit columns

Column titles and options vary based on the [process](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md) used to create your project and your team's decision to [treat bugs as requirements or tasks](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md).

Do the following steps to add and edit your columns:

1. Sign in to your organization (```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```).
2. Select **Boards** > **Boards** > **Configure board settings** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-gear.png" border="false"::: .

   :::image type="content" source="media/sequence-boards-boards-configure-board-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows selection sequence buttons, Boards, Boards, and Configure board settings.":::

3. Select **Columns**.
   - To add a column, select **+ Add column**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/add-columns-settings-dialog-add-test-ts.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows highlighted Add column button.":::
   
   - To edit a column, select the column tab. For example, in the following image, we choose to edit the Active column. 
   
   :::image type="content" source="media/columns/kanban-settings-columns-active-column.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Settings dialog and selection of an Active column.":::

4. Do any of the following tasks for your columns. These tasks link to sections further in this article:
   - [Map workflow states to columns](#map-workflow-states-to-columns)
   - [Rename a column](#rename-a-column)
   - [Split columns](#split-columns)

## Map workflow states to columns

Mapping workflow state categories to columns in boards is essential for visualizing the progress of work items. It ensures that each state of a work item is represented on the board, providing a clear and organized view of the workflow. This mapping helps teams quickly [identify the current status of work items](#update-status), [track their progress](#track-column-status), and [spot any bottlenecks](#identify-bottlenecks) or issues. By aligning workflow states with board columns, teams can maintain a shared understanding of the workflow and improve their ability to manage and complete tasks efficiently.

> [!TIP]   
> We recommend that you map each workflow **state** to a **column**. If it’s not mapped, it doesn’t appear on the board.

The following table describes default user story state categories.

|State category  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Proposed   | The first board column is automatically mapped to the default state for each work item. |
|In Progress | Work flow state must be specified for each work item type and column.       |
|Completed  | Can only map to the last board column.      |
|Removed     | Workflow state doesn't need to be specified.     |

For more information, see [About workflow and state categories](../work-items/workflow-and-state-categories.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/boards-columns-state-mapping.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows State mapping section of Column Edit page.":::

Do this task whenever you add columns, workflow states, or work item types (WITs). This action is typically necessary when you change the [Working with bugs setting](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md), add [WITs to the Requirement category](../../reference/add-wits-to-backlogs-and-boards.md), or [customize the workflow](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-workflow.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you add bugs or other work items to a board, it might create new workflow states that require adjustments to column-to-state mappings in the following situations:
>- When a team administrator [shows bugs on backlogs and boards](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md).
>- When a project administrator [adds work item types to backlogs and boards](../../reference/add-wits-to-backlogs-and-boards.md).
>- When a project collection or project administrator customizes the workflow for a work item type in the Requirement category using [inherited process](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-workflow.md) or [on-premises XML process](../../reference/xml/change-workflow-wit.md).

## Rename a column

Renaming your column titles to map to your workflow stages helps ensure clarity and alignment within your team. It allows everyone to understand the current status of work items at a glance and ensures that the board accurately reflects your team's workflow.

Rename a column directly from the board by selecting the column name, shown in the following image. You can also rename a column from the [column edit screen](#add-and-edit-columns).

:::image type="content" source="media/rename-kanban-columns-direct-ts.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing renaming a column directly on a board.":::

## Split columns

Each column represents a work stage, showing the number of items in progress. But, there’s often a lag between moving work into a column and starting it. To address this lag, enable split columns, which divide each column into "Doing" and "Done."

:::image type="content" source="media/kanban-board-split-columns-example-chart.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing with split columns.":::

Split columns help your team implement a pull mechanism, providing visibility into idle items and improving workflow transparency.

> [!NOTE]
> - Before you split columns, ensure that [each stage is mapped to a column](#map-workflow-states). Only split columns where clear hand-offs exist and you want teams to pull the item into the next stage.
> - There are different column titles and choices based on the [process](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md) used to create your project and whether your team chose to [treat bugs like requirements or like tasks](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md). 

Choose the column tab that you want to split and add a check mark in the box to cause the column to split.  

:::image type="content" source="media/columns/split-columns.png" alt-text="Screenshot of board settings page, Split columns.":::

> [!TIP]    
> You can filter queries and create charts using the [Board Column Done field](../queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#kanban_query_fields).

### Move items into the *Doing* and *Done* columns 

With split columns enabled, update item statuses as usual. When you complete work on an item, move it to *Done* instead of a downstream column. The next team member pulls it into *Doing* and reassigns it to themselves when ready.

For example, after finishing a coding task, move it to *Done* under Develop. The tester then pulls it into *Doing* under Test when ready to start testing.

:::image type="content" source="media/columns/split-columns-move-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing board with split column.":::

### Identify bottlenecks

Split columns provide greater insight into how many items sit idle in a *Done* column. Your team can easily see when items pile up, signaling a potential bottleneck.

Review the frequency and location of pile-ups, so your team can adjust processes to eliminate bottlenecks. Workflow processes with no or few bottlenecks correspond to perfect flows.

:::image type="content" source="media/kanban-board-identify-bottlenecks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of board, split columns showing stacked items.":::

### List work items in a *Doing* or *Done* column 

You can query for work items in a split column using the **Board Column Done** field. This field takes of a value of False when in the *Doing* column and True when in the *Done* column. 

For examples on querying Board columns, see [Query by assignment or workflow changes](../queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#kanban_query_fields).

<a id="definition-of-done"> </a>

## Add Definition of Done to a column 

When your team advances from one stage to the next, it's crucial they share a clear understanding of "Done." Define the criteria for the Definition of Done in each column. This action helps the team identify necessary tasks before advancing an item to the next stage, implementing the core tenet of making processes and policies explicit.

Choose a column tab to configure the Definition of Done for that column. 

:::image type="content" source="media/columns/definition-of-done-defined.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the columns management screen, entering plain text for Definition of Done.":::

Users can quickly double-check the criteria by choosing the Information tooltip :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/info.png" border="false"::: info icon.  

:::image type="content" source="media/columns/definition-of-done-information-tooltip.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing information tooltip of Definition of Done.":::

## Remove or move a column

Removing or moving a column can help streamline your board and better reflect your team's workflow and priorities. By adjusting the order of columns or removing unnecessary stages, you can ensure that the most critical stages are prominently displayed and that the workflow is intuitive for all team members.

### Remove a column

1. Ensure the column doesn't contain any work items. If it does, move the items to another column.
2. On the [Configure board settings](#add-and-edit-columns) page, select **Columns** > **Column options menu** :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: > **X Remove**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/columns/remove-column.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the selections for deleting a column in the Settings dialog.":::

### Move a column

To move a column, drag the column tab to the desired position on the board or in the **Column options menu**, select **Move left** or **Move right**.

:::image type="content" source="media/columns/column-options-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the column options menu in Configure board settings.":::

## Update status

To update status, drag-and-drop your work items. For example, to signal when work can start in a downstream stage, drag items to the next column. You can move an item from one column to any other column on the board, forward and back. 

:::image type="content" source="media/ALM_AC_DragItem.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows dragging an item from the Analyze column to the Develop column.":::

## Hand off work items

To hand off work to another team member, reassign it directly from the board.

:::image type="content" source="media/ALM_AC_Reassign.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows assigning an item from a board.":::

Users who receive the handoff can [set alerts](../../organizations/notifications/manage-your-personal-notifications.md) to get immediate email notifications of their newly assigned work. 

## Track column status

Use the [query tool](../queries/using-queries.md) to list a subset of work items for review, triage, update, or chart generation. For example, you can create a query to list all active user stories (specify two clauses: `Work Item Type=User Story` and `State=Active`). 

Specify [work in progress (WIP) limits](wip-limits.md), [split columns](#split-columns), and [definition of done](#definition-of-done).

## Change your team's priorities

Drag an item up or down within a column.
