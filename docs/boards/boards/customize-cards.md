# Customize cards  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-vsts-tfs-2015-on.md)]  

With the Kanban board, you gain a rich set of tools and a rich set of customization options. Kanban boards display work items as cards. Each card corresponds to a work item that you use to share information, track status, and assign work. Information rich cards provide at-a-glance info of interest to you and your team and allow you to update a field without opening the work item. With style rules, you can highlight cards and tasks based on the criteria you set.  


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"
When you enable annotations, you gain quick access to linked work items and other features. If you're new to working with the Kanban board, see [Kanban basics](../../boards/boards/kanban-basics.md).

In the card shown below, the following options have been set for the bug work item type:
- Show all core fields: ID, Assigned To, Story Points, Tags
- Show three more fields: State, Changed By, and Changed Date
- Apply tag colors
- Apply styling rule to display bugs with Severity=1 as yellow and bold and underline the Title field
- Enable Task, GitHub, and Test annotations

In the card shown below, the following options have been set for the bug work item type:
- Show all core fields: ID, Assigned To, Story Points, Tags
- Show three more fields: State, Changed By, and Changed Date
- Apply tag colors
- Apply styling rule to display bugs with Severity=1 as yellow and bold and underline the Title field
- Enable Tasks and Test annotations

::: moniker-end



::: moniker range="< tfs-2017"

In this example, the bug work item type shows all the core fields, three more fields, and tags. Also, To make severity 1 bugs stand out, a styling rule causes the card to display as yellow.

> [!NOTE] 
> This article addresses customization of a Kanban board. For information on customizing a Taskboard, see [Customize sprint Taskboards](../sprints/customize-taskboard.md). 


You can either increase or simplify the information that displays on your cards. It all depends on what's of interest to your team.  
- *Does your team like to refer to work items by their ID?* 
- *Do they want to see estimates?* 
- *Do they want to highlight work items according to set criteria?* 
- *Or, will just the bare bones of title and assignment suffice?* 

Your best bet is to show fields on cards based on what your team frequently refers to or updates when using the Kanban board. Also, add fields with information that you can use to filter the board.

You customize a work item type by adding fields, changing the workflow, adding custom rules and more. You can also add custom work item types and custom backlog levels.

## Card customization sequence 

Before you configure the cards, you'll want to make sure the following tasks are complete as possible. Otherwise, you'll find yourself revisiting your configuration.  

**Process Administrator**: 
1. Add custom work item types that you want to appear on your backlog or board. For details, see [Add and manage work item types](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-work-item-type.md).
2. Customize your product and portfolio backlogs to ensure all work item types you want to have will appear on the backlogs and boards. For details see [Customize backlogs & boards](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md). 
3. Customize each work item type to have any custom fields you want to show. For details, see [Customize a workflow](../../organizations/settings/work/add-custom-field.md).

**Team Administrator**:
1. Meet with your team and determine how the team wants to manage bugs, similar to requirements or tasks.  
1. [Add any tags](../queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md) you want to customize on cards to work items. 
1. Meet with your team and determine which annotations should appear on cards and how they want to configure inline tests.  
 

## Open your Kanban board settings

If you're not a team admin, [get added as one](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can customize the Kanban board.

You can customize cards that appear on the Kanban board for your product backlog or portfolio backlog such as features and epics. You follow similar steps, however you start from the [corresponding portfolio backlog](../../boards/backlogs/define-features-epics.md).  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. [Open your Kanban board.](kanban-quickstart.md). 

1. Choose the backlog level you want to customize. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Open backlog level to customize.](media/features-epics/select-portfolio-level.png)  

1. Choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-gear.png" border="false":::  gear icon to configure the board and set general team settings.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Open board settings for a team, vert nav.](../../organizations/settings/media/configure-team/open-board-settings.png)  

1. When done with your changes, choose **Save**.

::: moniker-end 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"

1. [Open your Kanban board](kanban-quickstart.md).  

1. Choose the backlog level you want to customize. 

1. Choose ![settings icon](../../media/icons/team-settings-gear-icon.png) to open the common configuration settings dialog for the Kanban board. 

	![Kanban board, open common configuration settings.](media/add-columns-open-settings-ts.png)

## Choose fields to appear on cards 
 
By showing a field on a card, you can edit that field directly on the board without having to open the card, unless it's a read-only field, such as the Change By and Changed Date fields. This quick update feature is useful when you need to update many work items at once. For example, you can add estimates for backlog items on the Kanban board. 

To change the Title, choose the pencil icon in the upper-right corner. 

<!---
Here we change the Assigned To field. 

![Kanban board, assign a work item.](media/ALM_CC_UpdateFieldOnCard.png)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
 
As a first step, you'll see that you can determine which fields appear on each card type. To add a custom field, you must first [add it to the process used to customize the project](../../organizations/settings/work/add-custom-field.md).

<a id="style-rule" > </a>  

## Define style rules to highlight cards  
 
With styling rules, you can cause cards to change color when their corresponding work items meet criteria that you set. Here, we highlight severity 1 bugs by having the cards display as yellow. 

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
This feature requires TFS 2015.1 or later versions.
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2018"
![Styling rule applied to bugs with Severity=1](media/customize-cards/card-style-s155-solo.png)
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2017"
![Styling rule applied to bugs with Severity=1](media/kanban-board-card-style-rule-example.png)
::: moniker-end


### Example styling rules 

What rules should you apply to highlight work items? Here are a few examples and their associated criteria.

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> | Work items | Criteria |
> |------------|------------|
> | High priority items | `Priority = 1` |
> | High effort items | `Effort 20` or `Story Points 20` |
> | Stale items unchanged in the last 5 days | `Changed Date @Today-5` |
> |Title contains a key word | `Title Contains Yes` |
> |Severity 1 bugs | `Severity = 1 - Critical   AND   Work Item Type = Bug` |
> |High value business items | `Business Value 50` |
> |Items assigned to specific feature area  | `Area Path Under Fabrikam Fiber\Phone` |
> |Contains specific tag   | `Tags Contain RTM` |
> |Blocked tasks (Scrum process only) | `Blocked = Yes` |

You can apply style rules to change the color of cards on Kanban boards and taskboards.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. From the Settings dialog, choose **Styles** to specify a style rule. Choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/green_plus_icon.png" border="false"::: plus icon to add a style. Select the color to apply to the card and define the criteria for the style rule. 

	In this example, we show the **Styles** dialog for the Dashboard. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Settings, Styles dialog.](../sprints/media/customize/taskboard-styles-priority.png)

	Follow these rules when creating and ordering your style rules:  
   - The criteria you specify works in a similar fashion as when [constructing a query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md). 
   - All clauses are considered AND clauses, grouping clauses isn't supported. 
   - Card rules apply to all work items that meet the rule criteria. 
   - Rule color applies to work items based on the order in which rules are listed. If you add more than one style rule, make sure that you move them in the order of most importance. Simply drag them into the order you want them applied. 
   - You can quickly enable and disable a style rule.

     Here we add a Stale tasks rule that highlights tasks that haven't changed in the last five days.

     ![Taskboard, Style dialog, example style rule.](../sprints/media/customize/task-board-card-style-rule-stale-tasks.png)   

1. To copy or delete a style rule, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon and select **Clone** or **Delete**.

<a id="color-tags" > </a>

## Color-code tags   

Prior to setting tag colors, first [add tags to backlog items](../../boards/queries/add-tags-to-work-items.md) that you want to highlight with color.   
 
::: moniker range="tfs-2015"  
Requires TFS 2015.1 or later version.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"  

## Enable or disable an annotation

By default, all annotations are enabled that are applicable for the board you selected. This includes all work item types added to the next level backlog, GitHub, and Tests. Disable those annotations, which your team won't use or which you don't want teams to use for a particular backlog level. 

When you disable an annotation, you also disable the feature to add the associated object from the Kanban board. For example, if you disable the Tests annotation, you disable the ability to add tests from the currently selected Kanban board. 

As shown in the following examples, the **Task** and **Test** annotations indicate that two each of tasks and tests have been defined for the work item. Disable the annotations you're team doesn't use from the **Annotations** tab. 

> [!div class="mx-tdBreakAll"]  
> | Task annotations  |Test annotations  |No annotations |
> |-------------|----------|----------|    
> |![Task annotations enabled.](media/annotate-task.png) | ![Test annotations enabled.](media/annotate-test.png) | ![Annotations disabled.](media/annotate-none.png) | 

To learn more about using these features, see [Add task checklists](../../boards/boards/add-task-checklists.md) and [Add, run, and update inline tests](../../boards/boards/add-run-update-tests.md).

To learn how, see [Set up your backlogs and boards, Customize your Kanban Board checklist items](../backlogs/set-up-your-backlog.md#customize-checklist-2019). 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

1. Open the Settings dialog for the Kanban board you want to customize and choose **Annotations** .
2. Check those annotations that you want enabled. For example, to enable tasks but disable tests, check the following boxes.

## Configure inline tests 

You can control the test plan under which inline tests you add through the Kanban board are created. You can choose to create a new test plan for each new test that you add, or add all new tests to a selected test plan. 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

1. Open the Settings dialog for the Kanban board (product backlog only) you want to customize and choose **Annotations**. Make sure that **Test** annotation is enabled, a requirement to configure inline tests.

1. Then, choose **Tests**, and then choose the options you want. To select a test plan, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions icon and select one test plan from the query provided.  

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Configure inline tests.](media/customize-cards/settings-tests.png)  

   In a test plan, a test case can exist in multiple test suites. For example, you may define several test suites for each product feature and the test cases test scenarios across features. The test case might exist in both feature's test suite with the same configurations and test steps. As a result of this setup, the tester might run the same test case multiple times for the same product version. 

    To avoid the redundancies that can occur under this scenario, you should choose **Show same outcome of the tests in multiple suites under the same plan** checkbox. When checked, the Test Points of the same Test Case and configuration, shows the same latest outcome. When the tester runs any one test, the output is synced with all other test points (which are of same Test Case work item and same configuration) in the Test Plans. The tester can use the outcome and choose not to run the test again.
