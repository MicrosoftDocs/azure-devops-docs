# Customize cards  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-2015-on.md)]  

While many work tracking views show up as lists&mdash;such as your backlogs and queries&mdash;board views display cards. Information rich cards not only provide at-a-glance info of interest to you and your team, they also provide a way for you to update a field without opening the work item. And, with style rules, you can highlight those work items with select colors based on the criteria you set.  

Each card corresponds to a work item which you use to share information, track status, and assign work. 

In this example, the bug work item type (WIT) shows all the core fields, three additional fields, and tags. Also, To make severity 1 bugs stand out, a styling rule has been added to cause the card to display as yellow.  

In the card shown below, the following customizations have been set for the bug work item type (WIT):
- Show all core fields: ID, Assigned To, Story Points, Tags
- Show three additional fields: State, Changed By, and Changed Date
- Apply tag colors
- Apply styling rule to display bugs with Severity=1 as yellow and bold and underline the Title field

> [!NOTE]  
> You can customize a work item type which is different then customizing the card displayed on the Kanban board or taskboard. You customize a WIT by adding fields, changing the workflow, adding custom rules and more. You can also add custom work item types and custom backlog levels. For details, see [Customize an inheritance process](../../organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md).

You can either increase or simplify the information that displays on your cards. It all depends on what's of interest to your team. Does your team like to refer to work items by their ID? Do they want to see estimates? Do they want to highlight work items according to set criteria? Or, will just the bare bones of title and assignment suffice? 

Your best bet is to show fields on cards based on what your team frequently refers to or updates when using the Kanban and taskboards. Also, add fields with information that you can use to filter the board. If you're new to working with these tools, see [Kanban basics](../../boards/boards/kanban-basics.md) and [Sprint planning](../../boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md). 


<a id="fields"></a>
## Update fields from the cards
Using the board views provides you with quick and easy ways to update work items as work progresses. Making daily or frequent updates helps everyone on your team stay in sync with what's been done and what needs doing next. 

To update status of a work item, you simply drag-and-drop cards to a different column. To change the order or stack ranking of a work item, you drag a card up or down within a column. 

For example, on the Kanban board, moving the card from Analyze to Develop updates the corresponding State field. In this case, the State field updates from Approved to Committed. 

![Kanban board, move a work item](_img/ALM_CC_MoveCard.png)

Another handy feature is to simply update a field without having to open the work item. You can update most fields shown on the card. Here we reassign a requirement. 

![Kanban board, assign a work item](_img/ALM_CC_UpdateFieldOnCard.png)

This quick update feature is particularly useful when you need to update a number of work items at once. For example, you can add estimates for backlog items on the Kanban board or update remaining work on the taskboard. 

To change the title, click the pencil icon in the upper-right corner. To add tags, double-click the work item to open it. And, just a reminder, you can't change the IDs for a work item, not from the card and not from within the form. 

To customize cards on the Kanban board, see [Change how cards display on the Kanban board](#kanban-board). To customize taskboard cards, see [Change how cards display on the taskboard](#task-board).

## Highlight cards  

With styling rules, you can cause cards to change color when their corresponding work items meet criteria that you set. Here, we highlight severity 1 bugs by having the cards display as yellow. 

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
This feature requires TFS 2015.1 or later versions.

![Styling rule applied to bugs with Severity=1](_img/kanban-board-card-style-rule-example.png)

### Example styling rules 
What rules should you apply to highlight work items? Here are a few examples and their associated criteria . 

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> | Work items | Criteria |
> |------------|------------|
> | High priority items | ```Priority = 1``` |
> | High effort items | ```Effort 20 ``` or ```Story Points 20 ``` |
> | Stale items unchanged in the last 5 days | ```Changed Date @Today-5``` |
> |Title contains a key word | ```Title Contains Yes``` |
> |Severity 1 bugs | ```Severity = 1 - Critical   AND   Work Item Type = Bug``` |
> |High value business items | ```Business Value 50``` |
> |Items assigned to specific feature area  | ```Area Path Under Fabrikam Fiber\Phone``` |
> |Contains specific tag   | ```Tags Contain RTM``` |
> |Blocked tasks (Scrum process only) | ```Blocked = Yes``` |

## Choose fields to appear on cards (Kanban boards)

By showing a field on a card, you can edit that field directly on the board without having to open the card, unless it's a read-only field, such as the Change By and Changed Date fields. You can also customize the cards that appear on the Kanban board for features and epics. You follow similar steps, however you start from the [corresponding portfolio backlog](../../boards/backlogs/define-features-epics.md).  


::: moniker range="vsts"
 
As a first step, you'll see that you can determine which fields appear on each card type. To add a custom field, you must first [add it to the process used to customize the project](../../organizations/settings/work//add-custom-field.md).

## Choose fields to appear on cards (Taskboards)

Scrum teams use the taskboard to burn down work and report on progress during daily standups. Your taskboard shows cards that correspond to both requirements and tasks. If you want bugs to appear on the taskboard, change your team settings for [show bugs on the backlogs and boards](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md).

You change the way cards appear on the taskboard in the same way you change the appearance of cards on Kanban boards. Only here, you start from the taskboard.

## Define style rules to highlight cards  

You can apply style rules to change the color of cards on Kanban boards and taskboards.  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)  

::: moniker range=">= azdevserver-2019"

1.	[Open the Kanban board](kanban-quickstart.md) or [taskboard](../sprints/task-board.md) that you want to customize. If you're not a team admin, [get added as one](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can customize boards.

0. Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/blue-gear.png) gear icon to open the **Settings** dialog. 

0. Choose **Styles** to specify a style rule. Choose the ![ ](../../_img/icons/green_plus_icon.png) plus icon to add a style. Select the color to apply to the card and define the criteria for the style rule. 

	In this example we show the **Styles** dialog for the taskboard. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Settings, Styles dialog](_img/customize-cards/taskboard-styles-priority.png)

	Follow these rules when creating and ordering your style rules:
	- The criteria you specify works in a similar fashion as when [constructing a query](../../boards/queries/using-queries.md) 
	- All clauses are considered AND clauses, grouping clauses isn't supported  
	- Card rules apply to all work items that meet the rule criteria  
	- Rule color applies to work items based on the order in which rules are listed. If you add more than one style rule, make sure that you move them in the order of most importance. Simply drag them into the order you want them applied.  
	- You can quickly enable and disable a style rule     

	Here we add a Stale tasks rule which highlights tasks that haven't changed in the last five days.

## Enable annotations (Kanban boards) 

With the Kanban board, you gain a rich set of tools and a rich set of customization options. Annotations provide visual cues about work items, indicating the number of tasks or tests that have been defined for that work item. Choose an annotation to expand the set or gain more information. 

As shown in the following examples, the **Task** and **Test** annotations indicate that two each of tasks and tests have been defined for the work item. If you find that there are some features you're not using, you can disable them from the Annotations tab.

To learn more about using these features, see [Add task checklists](../../boards/boards/add-task-checklists.md) and [Add, run, and update inline tests](../../boards/boards/add-run-update-tests.md).  

### Enable or disable an annotation
