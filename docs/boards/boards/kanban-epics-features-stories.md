# Add Kanban board features and epics  

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

If you track progress on your backlog with Kanban, you can also use Kanban boards to track epics and features.  

And, as with [child task checklists for backlog items](add-task-checklists.md), you can quickly define and track the progress of child items for your features or epics. Here we see several stories defined for features, both in progress and completed.    

In this article, you'll learn: 
>[!div class="checklist"]    
> * How to add epics and features using your portfolio backlogs    
> * Keyboard shortcuts for working with the Kanban board  

For information on managing features and epics as a list and examples for features and epics, see [Define features and epics](../backlogs/define-features-epics.md).

## Open your Kanban board from the web portal

Your Kanban board is one of two types of boards available to you. For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](../backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans.md). To switch to the [product backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md), choose **Stories backlog**. And, to switch to the [taskboard](../sprints/task-board.md), choose **Sprints** and then choose **Taskboard**.

## Add epics or features   

Add new items to a feature or epic through the item's   :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false":::  Action menu. For descriptions of fields used to support features and epics, see [Define features and epics](../backlogs/define-features-epics.md). 

![Web portal, Feature Kanban board, Open the context menu of a feature to add a story](media/features-epics/add-user-story.png)

When you have many items to add, keep typing your task titles and press Enter. If you have details you want to add about to a work item, hover over the item and press Enter.

If you're new to working with the Kanban board, see [Kanban basics](kanban-basics.md)

For more information on working with a checklist on a Kanban board, see [Add tasks or child items as checklists](add-task-checklists.md). You can run the same operations for the features and epics Kanban boards as you do with the Kanban board for the product backlog. These operations include:    

- Mark an item as done  
- Reorder and reparent work items  

To customize the columns, swimlanes, or cards for each Kanban board, make sure you first select the board. Then, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-gear.png" border="false":::  or :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/gear_icon.png" border="false"::: gear icon to open the Settings dialog. See these articles for details:
