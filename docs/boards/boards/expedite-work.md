# Expedite work using swimlanes

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]  

Your Kanban board helps you visualize the flow of work as it moves from defined to completed. When you add swimlanes, you can also visualize the status of work that supports different service-level classes. You can create a swimlane to represent any other dimension that supports your tracking needs.    

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/prerequisites-team-settings.md)]

## Types of swimlanes  

You can use up to 50 swimlanes to sort work on your Kanban board to track items that you differentiate as follows: 
*	High priority items  
*	Service-level class  
*	Date-driven requirement  
*	Dependency for or from another team   
*	Blocked items  
*	Technical debt or other engineering work that's not a specific user story  

## Track work in swimlanes  

Once you've set up your swimlanes, you can drag items into a swimlane, and also reorder them within the lane.  

> [!TIP]  
> - Enter `o` to expand all swimlanes and `u` to collapse all swimlanes. To move the focus up or down, enter the `↑↓` up/down arrows. For more information, see [Keyboard shortcuts](../../project/navigation/keyboard-shortcuts.md).
> - When you have many swimlanes or cards on your board, you may encounter slow performance when dragging a card. We recommend that you use swimlanes in conjunction with card styles, tags, and board filters to manage your work items. If you have a lot of cards in the default lane, place that lane lower on the board to enhance performance when dragging a card to another swimlane.

> [!NOTE]
> The default lane appears unlabeled on the Kanban board. You can rename it to anything you like, but, you can't delete it or apply rules.

You can also focus on a single swimlane by collapsing all other lanes.

## Add or remove a swimlane 

*Which swimlanes support your tracking needs?* Once you've identified one or two, add them to your Kanban board.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

1. [Open your Kanban board](kanban-quickstart.md). If you're not a team admin, [get added as one](../../organizations/settings/add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project administrators can customize the Kanban board.

1. Choose :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/blue-gear.png" border="false"::: **Configure board settings** to configure the board.  

	:::image type="content" source="media/expedite/choose-configure-board-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Kanban board, Choose Configure board settings.":::

2. Choose **Swimlanes**, choose **Add swimlane**, and then enter the name of the swimlane you want to add. For example, here we enter *Expedite*. You can optionally select the more actions icon :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/more-actions.png" border="false"::: to insert a new swimlane above or below another swimlane.

	> [!NOTE]  
	> The following images show the user interface that displays when the **New Boards Hub** preview feature is enabled. Some features are only available when the **New Boards Hub** is enabled as described in [Key concepts and work item tasks in Azure Boards](../work-items/quick-ref.md). For example, the ability to choose the swimlane color is only supported when the **New Boards Hub** feature is enabled. To enable it, see [Manage or enable features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

	:::image type="content" source="media/expedite/add-swimlane-new-board-hubs-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Kanban board Settings, Swimlane tab, Add swimlane.":::

3. To set the color of the swimlane, choose a color from the drop-down menu. To reset the swimlane to the default, choose :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/refresh.png" border="false":::  **Reset to default color**. 

	:::image type="content" source="media/expedite/pick-swimlane-color.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Kanban board Settings, Swimlane tab, choose swimlane color.":::

4. To reorder a swimlane, choose the up or down menu selector :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/context-menu-selector.png" border="false"::: to move it up or down. To remove a swimlane, choose :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/trash-can.png" border="false"::: the trash bin icon, but first move all items out of the lane.

	:::image type="content" source="media/expedite/move-remove-swimlane-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Kanban board Settings, Swimlane tab, swimlane menu options."::: 

5. When you're done with your changes, choose **Save**.

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
	> ![Kanban board settings dialog, Add a swimlane](media/expedite/settings-swimlanes-add.png)  

	The default lane appears unlabeled on the Kanban board. You can rename it to anything you like, however, you can't delete it. Also, you can rename it directly from the Kanban board.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Kanban board settings dialog, Reorder a swimlane](media/expedite/swimlanes-reorder.png)  

4. If you need to delete a swimlane, first move all items out of the lane. Then open the Settings dialog, choose the  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false":::  actions icon and select **Remove**.

## Set up swimlane rules

Swimlane rules are similar to style rules, but instead they allow you to set up conditions on your Kanban board to automatically move work items into specific lanes. For example, you can set up a lane for each person on your team. When you assign the work item, it gets placed into that lane.

Swimlane rules get executed in order, so once the rule is met, it executes and moves on to the next work item. For example, Lane 1 has a rule that says "where priority = 1" and Lane 2 has a rule that says "where priority = 2". If the work item is set to priority = 1, it gets moved into Lane 1.

The following limits apply to swimlanes:
- Up to five rules per lane
- Max of 25 rules total
- Only `AND` rules are supported

Complete the following steps to set up swimlane rules for your Kanban board.

1. From your Kanban board, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/team-settings-gear-icon.png" border="false"::: gear icon to **Configure board settings**.

2. Select **Swimlanes**, select the **swimlane** or **[+ Add swimlane](#add-or-remove-a-swimlane)**, and then select **+ Add criteria**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/expedite/add-swimlane-criteria.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing sequence of buttons to select to add a swimlane rule.":::

3. Choose from the dropdown menus for each of the following entries: **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value**, and then choose **Save**. For more information, see the [examples in the next section](#examples-of-swimlane-rules). 

   :::image type="content" source="media/expedite/swimlane-rule-criteria.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing field, operator, and value selections for swimlane rule.":::

> [!TIP]
> You can't assign rules to the Default lane, but you can optionally rename it.

When your board refreshes, your work items are listed within the appropriate swimlane. 

### Examples of swimlane rules

The following examples show some of the ways you can use and set up swimlane rules.

- **Track priority**. We created rules for the `Work Item Type` and `Priority` fields, so work items automatically go into the appropriate swimlane.
  
  **Settings**

  **Kanban board results**

  :::image type="content" source="media/expedite/board-priority-swimlanes.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing priority swimlanes on Kanban board.":::

- **Track the parents of your work items**. We created rules for the `Work item type` field, so you can quickly see parents (features) and children (user stories and bugs) in their own swimlanes on the Kanban board.
  
  **Settings**

  :::image type="content" source="media/expedite/work-item-type-swimlane-rule-setup.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing rules set up for work item types.":::
  
  **Kanban board results**
  
  :::image type="content" source="media/expedite/board-track-parent-work-items-swimlanes.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing parent work item swimlanes on Kanban board.":::

- **Track each person's work on your team**. We created rules for the `Assigned to` field, so that when you assign a work item, it's placed into that user's lane.

## Query for work items based on swimlane

You can track which work items have been added to a Kanban board swimlane by creating a query and using the [Board Lane field](../queries/query-by-workflow-changes.md#kanban_query_fields).
