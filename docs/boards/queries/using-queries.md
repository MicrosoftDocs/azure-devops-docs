# Define a query

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-all.md)]

Work item queries generate lists of work items based on the filter criteria you provide. You can then save and share these managed queries with others. In contrast, semantic searches list work items, but can't be saved or shared. 

You can create queries from the web portal or from a supported client, such as Visual Studio Team Explorer and Team Explorer Everywhere. Also, you can open a query in [Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) to perform bulk additions and modifications.  

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

> ![Query Editor, web browser.](media/using-queries/query-editor.png)  
 
#### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Query Editor, Visual Studio.](media/using-queries/visual-studio-new-query-editor.png)  

***

> [!NOTE]  
> To define queries in Visual Studio 2019, you need to [Set the Work Items experience](../work-items/set-work-item-experience-vs.md) to the legacy option.

If you find that your queries take too long to return results, review the [Guidance to create high-performing queries](high-performing-queries.md).  

In this article you'll learn:  

> [!div class="checklist"]    
> * How to add or create a query 
> * How to query across projects   
> * How to group and ungroup query clauses 
> * How to create a tree of work items or a direct-links query 
 
For quick access to all query tasks, supported operators&mdash;such as, `Contains`, `In`, `In Group`, and `<>`(not operator) &mdash; based on field data type, and query examples, see [Query quick reference](query-index-quick-ref.md).  
 
## Query filters

From the Query Editor, you can exercise the following filter functions. Choose the filter to jump to an article with sample queries. 
In addition to the query filters, you can [interactively apply filters to query results](../backlogs/filter-backlogs-boards-plans.md).

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
> [!NOTE] 
> Managed queries don't support proximity searches, however semantic searches do. In addition, semantic searches supports both `*` and `?` as wildcard characters and you can use more than one wildcard character to match more than one character. To learn more, see [Functional work item search](../../project/search/functional-work-item-search.md).

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/prerequisites-queries.md)]

## Open Queries 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/open-queries.md)] 


<a id="flat-list" />

## Define a flat-list query

You can start a fresh, new query from the **Queries** tab in the web portal or the **Work Items** tab in Team Explorer.  

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Add new query, new experience](media/view-run-queries/new-query-new-exp.png)  

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"  

![Queries page, Choose New query from the drop down menu](media/using-queries-new-query-ts.png)  

::: moniker-end  


<a id="query-across-projects" /> 

<a id="across-projects" />  

## Query across or within projects 

By default, new queries are scoped to the current project. However, you can create queries to find work items defined within the organization or project collection. All queries that you save, however, are saved under a specific project. 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"  

To list work items defined in two or more projects, checkmark **Query across projects**. For example, the following query finds all features created in all projects within the last 30 days.
 
<img src="media/using-queries-query-across-projects.png" alt="Web portal, Queries page, Query Editor, Checkbox, Query across projects" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" /> 

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"  

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Query across projects** feature is supported from TFS 2015.1 and later versions.  

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"  

With the **Query across projects** checked, you can add the Team Project field to filter to a select number of projects.   

<img src="media/using-queries-query-across-select-projects.png" alt="Azure Boards and TFS 2015.1, Web portal, Query across select projects using the In operator" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

> [!NOTE]
> Separate multiple project names with the list separator that corresponds to the regional settings defined for your client computer, for example, a comma (,). 

The *Team Project* field becomes available only after you check  **Query across projects**.  Moreover, when **Query across projects** is unchecked, only those fields from those WITs defined in the current project appear in the Field drop-down menu. When **Query across projects** is checked, all fields from all WITs defined in all projects in the collection appear in the Field drop-down menu.  

::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="tfs-2013"   

To find all features created in all projects within the last 30 days, remove the <strong>Team Project=@Project</strong> clause from the query.  

<img src="media/using-queries-query-across-all-projects-tfs.png" alt="TFS 2013-2015, Web portal, Query across select projects using the In operator" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

All fields from all WITs defined in all projects in the collection always appear in the Field drop-down menu.  

Use <strong>Team Project=@Project</strong> to scope the query to find only those work items defined for the current project. 

::: moniker-end  
<a id="define-clause" />

## Define a clause

You create a query by defining one or more clauses. Each clause defines a filter criteria for a single field. Choose **Add new clause** to add another clause and then choose the **Field**, **Operator**, and **Value** for that clause.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Define a clause.](media/using-queries/define-clause.png)  

For example, you can search for all work items assigned to you by specifying the **Assigned To** field, the equals (=) operator, and the <strong>@Me</strong> macro which represents your user identity.

### Sample query clause 

<table>
<tr>
	<th>And/Or</th>
	<th>Field</th>
	<th>Operator</th>
	<th>Value</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><strong>And</strong></p></td>
	<td><p><strong>Assigned To</strong></p></td>
	<td><p><strong>=</strong></p></td>
	<td><p><strong>&#64;Me</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</table>

For a quick reference of the operators available based on the field data type, see [Query index quick reference](query-index-quick-ref.md#fields-operators-macros). 

All clauses you add are added as an **And** statement. Choose **Or** to change the grouping. You group clauses to ensure that the clause statements are executed in the sequence required. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/tip-wiql-extension.md)]

### Checklist for how to define a query clause

1. In the first empty row, under the **Field** column heading, choose the down arrow to display the list of available fields, and choose an item in the list.

	For more information, see [Query Fields and Values](query-operators-variables.md#field-values).

2. In the same row, under the **Operator** column heading, choose the down arrow to display the list of available operators, and choose an item in the list.

	For more information, see [Operators](query-operators-variables.md#operators).

3. In the same row, under the **Value** column heading, either type a value, or choose the down arrow, and choose an item in the list.

	For more information about how to use a macro or variable to specify the current project, user, date, or other selection, see [Variables](query-operators-variables.md#variables).

5. To add a clause, choose **Add new clause**.

	You can add a clause to the end of the query, insert a clause after an existing clause (![insert clause icon](media/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588311.png)), and remove (![remove clause icon](media/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588312.png)), group (![group clause icon](media/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588313.png)), and ungroup (![ungroup clause icon](media/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588314.png)) clauses as needed.


<a id="tree-query" />

## Use a tree of work items to view hierarchies  


Use the :::image type="icon" source="media/11.png" border="false"::: **Tree of Work Items** query to view a multi-tiered, nested list of work items. For example, you can view all backlog items and their linked tasks.  Expand (Expand node (![Expand node, web portal](media/13.png)) or collapse (![Collapse node, web portal](media/14.png)) nodes to focus on different parts of the tree.  

> [!NOTE]    
> You can't construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases. These items aren't linked together using parent-child link types. However, you can create a direct links query that lists test-related work items. Also, you can, [view the hierarchy through the Test>Test Plans page](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md). 

Define the filter criteria for both parent and child work items. To find linked children, select **Match top-level work items first**. To find linked parents, select **Match linked work items first**.

## Use direct links to view dependencies

Use the :::image type="icon" source="media/16.png" border="false"::: **Work items and Direct links** query to track work items that depend on other tracked work, such as tasks, bugs, issues, or features. For example, you can view backlog items that depend on other items being implemented or a bug being fixed. 

Use the direct links query to track dependencies your team has that other teams work on, or manage commitments your team has made to other teams. Specify the filter criteria for both top and linked work items, and select the types of links used to filter the dependencies.

- **Only return items that have matching links**: First-tier work items are returned, but only if they have links to work items specified by the linked work items filter criteria. 

- **Return all top level items**: All first-tier work items are returned regardless of the linked work items filter criteria. Second-tier work items that are linked to the first tier are returned if they match the linked work items filter criteria.

- **Only return items that do not have matching links**: First-tier work items are returned, but only if they do not have links to work items specified by the linked work items filter criteria.

<a id="and-or" /> 
<a id="logical-groupings" /> 

## And/Or logical expression

You specify **And** or **Or** to create logical expressions of your query clauses. Specify **And** to find work items that meet the criteria in both the current clause and the previous clause. Specify **Or** to find work items that meet the criterion in either the current clause or the previous clause.

You can add one new clause for each work item field in order to refine your search criteria, so that it returns only the set of work items that you want. If you do not receive the results that you expect from your query, you can add, remove, group, or ungroup query clauses to refine your query results.

You can group query clauses to operate as a single unit separate from the rest of the query, similar to putting parentheses around an expression in a mathematical equation or logic statement. When you group clauses, the **AND** or **OR** for the first clause in the group applies to the whole group.

<a id="group-clauses" /> 

### Group clauses

Grouped clauses operate as a single unit separate from the rest of the query, similar to putting parentheses around a mathematical equation or logic expression. The And or Or operator for the first clause in the group applies to the whole group.

As the following examples show, the grouped clauses are translated to the corresponding logical expression.

> [!TIP]   
> To view the WIQL syntax for a query, install the [WIQL query editor extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor) which will allow you to see the WIQL version of any Query UI entry. This extension allows you to see just how AND/OR grouped clauses are treated. 

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> |Query| Grouped clauses|Logical expression|
> |---|---|---|
> |**1** |![Screenshot showing a group clause query. Filters are set up for the Work item type field and either the State field or the Assigned to field.](media/using-queries/and-or-clause-no-grouping.png)|![Screenshot of a logical expression. An AND operator groups the Work item type, State, and Assigned to fields. An OR operator groups the State and Assigned to fields.](media/using-queries/and-or-clause-no-grouping-wiql.png)|
> |**2**| ![Screenshot showing a group clause query, with filters for both the Work item type field and one of either the State field or the Assigned to field.](media/using-queries/and-or-clause-with-grouping.png)|![Screenshot of a logical expression. An AND operator groups the Work item type with the State or Assigned to fields, which are grouped by an OR operator.](media/using-queries/and-or-clause-with-grouping-wiql.png)|
> |**3**| ![Screenshot showing a group clause query. Filters are set up for either the Work item type field or both the State field and the Assigned to field.](media/using-queries/and-or-clause-reverse-grouping.png)|![Screenshot of a logical expression. An OR operator links the Work item type to both the State and the Assigned to fields, which are linked by an AND operator.](media/using-queries/and-or-clause-reverse-grouping-wiql.png)|

These queries return work items that are type Bug and meet the following logical expressions:  
- **Query 1**: AND State=Active OR Assigned to @Me  
- **Query 2**: AND (State=Active OR Assigned to @Me)  
- **Query 3**: OR (State=Active AND Assigned to @Me)  


To group one or more clauses, select them and then choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/group-clauses-icon.png" border="false"::: group clauses icon.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Web portal, Group Selected Query Clauses](media/view-run-queries/group-clauses.png)  

You can also group several grouped clauses by checking the boxes of each clause that has already been grouped, and then choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/group-clauses-icon.png" border="false"::: group clauses icon.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Group multiple query clauses](media/using-queries/multiple-clauses.png)


If your query results don't return expected results, follow these steps: 

- Make sure that each clause is defined as you intended.  
- Verify And/Or assignments to each clause. If your results contain more work items than expected, often an Or clause is present instead of an And clause.  
- Determine if you need to group or change the grouping of the query clauses and the And/Or assignments of each grouped clause.  
- Add more query clauses to refine your query filter criteria.  
- Review the options available to specify [fields, operators, and values](query-operators-variables.md).  

<a id="ungroup-clause" />

### Ungroup a clause

To ungroup a clause, choose the :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/ungroup-clause.png" border="false"::: ungroup clauses icon for the grouped clause.
