# About managed queries  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

A query lists a filtered set of work items. You can initiate a query using the [query editor](using-queries.md). Optionally, you can perform an adhoc search using the [search box](search-box-queries.md). 

With queries, you can perform these functions: 

- List items to perform bulk updates, assign or reassign    
- Review work that's in progress or recently closed  
- Triage work (set priority, review, update)   
- Create a chart and add it to a dashboard  
- Create a chart to get a count of items or sum a field  
- Create a chart that shows a burndown or burnup over time 
- View a tree of parent-child related work items 

For the mechanics of constructing and saving queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](using-queries.md). For specific examples, click  one of the following links.  

## Getting started 

If you are looking for a specific work item, use the adhoc search box. If you want to generate a list of work items to triage, update, chart, or share with others, then use a managed query. 
 
- [View and run a query](view-run-query.md)   
- [Perform an adhoc search](search-box-queries.md)  
- [Query editor](using-queries.md)    
- [Query operators & macros](query-operators-variables.md)       
- [Organize and run managed queries](organize-queries.md)   


###Additional tips for working with queries
-   To find work items that are assigned to you, add **@Me** as the value for the Assigned To field in one of the query clauses.  
-   All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the **My Queries** area. To create queries and query folders under **Shared Queries**, you must have the Contribute permission set. For more information, see [Set permissions on queries](../queries/set-query-permissions.md).
-   You can modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an iteration, or another field. To modify a query, [open the query editor](../queries/using-queries.md).   
-   You can open any query in [Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md), where you can update the fields of one or more work items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.  
-   You can [visualize status or progress](../../report/dashboards/charts.md) by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart for flat-list queries.

### Query within or across projects
By default, you query within a single project. However, using the query editor, you can [query across projects](using-queries.md#across-projects). 

### Visualize related work and other objects 

You can view related work items and object within a work item form by installing the [Work item visualization extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.WorkItemVisualization) available from the Visual Studio Marketplace.
