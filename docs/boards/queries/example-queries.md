# About managed queries  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

A query lists a filtered set of work items. You can initiate a query using the [query editor](using-queries.md). Optionally, you can perform an ad hoc search using the [search box](search-box-queries.md). 

With queries, you can perform these functions: 

- List items to perform bulk updates, assign or reassign    
- Review work that's in progress or recently closed  
- Triage work (set priority, review, update)   
- Create a chart and add it to a dashboard  
- Create a chart to get a count of items or sum a field  
- Create a chart that shows a burndown or burnup over time 
- View a tree of parent-child related work items 

For the mechanics of constructing and saving queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](using-queries.md). If you find that your queries take too long to return results, review the [Guidance to create high-performing queries](high-performing-queries.md).  

For specific examples, choose one of the following articles listed under [Example queries](#examples).  

## Getting started 

If you are looking for a specific work item, use the ad hoc search box. If you want to generate a list of work items to triage, update, chart, or share with others, then use a managed query. 
 
- [View and run a query](view-run-query.md)   
- [Perform an ad hoc search](search-box-queries.md)  
- [Query editor](using-queries.md)    
- [Query operators & macros](query-operators-variables.md)  

For a quick reference to query editor tasks and sample queries, see [Query quick reference](query-index-quick-ref.md). 

### Additional tips for working with queries

- To find work items that are assigned to you, add <strong>@Me</strong> as the value for the Assigned To field in one of the query clauses.  
- All valid users with standard access can create queries and folders under the **My Queries** area. To create queries and query folders under **Shared Queries**, you must have the Contribute permission set. For more information, see [Set permissions on queries](../queries/set-query-permissions.md).
- You can modify any query by adding criteria to focus on a product area, an iteration, or another field. To modify a query, [open the query editor](../queries/using-queries.md).   
- You can open any query in [Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md), where you can update the fields of one or more work items and publish your changes to the database for tracking work items.  
- You can [visualize status or progress](../../report/dashboards/charts.md) by creating a pie-chart, column chart, or trend chart for flat-list queries.

## My Queries, Shared Queries, and Favorites

Only you can view and run queries that you save under **My Queries** with the queries directory. Also, you can favorite one of these queries to have it appear within your query selector.

Queries you and others save under **Shared Queries** can be viewed by everyone with access to the project. Shared queries can be organized within folders and favorited by you or for a team. Also, you can set permissions on the folders and queries to prevent others from moving or editing them. 

For details, see:
- [Organize queries, add a query folder](organize-queries.md)
- [Set query permissions](set-query-permissions.md)
- [Favorite a query](view-run-query.md#favorite) and [Set personal or team favorites](../../project/navigation/set-favorites.md#favorite-a-shared-query)

### Visualize related work and other objects 

You can view related work items and object within a work item form by installing the [Work item visualization extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.WorkItemVisualization) available from the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab.
