# Query by titles, IDs, and rich-text fields
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

When you want to find work items based on a keyword or phrase, you can do so by entering the [keyword or phrase within the search box](search-box-queries.md#keywords). This initiates a new query which you can modify as needed to further refine your filter criteria, as described in this topic. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/search-box.md)]

<a id="keyword"/>
## List items based on keywords or phrases

Use **Contains** or **Contains Words** to list items that partially or exactly match the words or phrase that you enter.  

![Editor for flat list query for filtering key words](_img/example-work-item-queries/IC675039.png)   

Choose **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** to search against exact or partial matches of a word or phrase. Choose **Contains Words** or **Does Not Contain Words** to search against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, <b>*</b>. These operators use the full-text search index.

 

<a id="undefined-value"/>
## List items based on undefined field values

You can find work items that have an undefined field value by using the equals operator (=) and leaving the Value for the field blank. For example, the following filters will list all work items of type Task whose Activity field is blank.  

![Filter based on blank entries](_img/example-work-item-queries/IC736440.png)

To list work items based on a field that isn't blank, use the not operator (<>) and leave the Value blank.

<a id="category"/>
## List items based on categories

To filter work items based on the category they belong to, use the **In Group** operator. For example, the following filter criteria will return all work items that are in the current project, assigned to the team member, and defined as belonging to the Bug Category.

![Query clause to find work items by category](_img/example-work-item-queries/IC720125.png)

<a id="category"/>
## What items appear in the Requirement or Task categories? 

The default assignments of work item types to each category are listed below for each process.  

| Process | Requirement category | Task category |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Agile | User Story | Task |
| Scrum | Product Backlog Item | Task |
| CMMI | Requirement | Task |

However, each team can determine if the Bug work item type appears in either the Requirement or Task category. See [Show bugs on backlogs and boards](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md). 

Also, you can add custom work item types to a backlog. For details, see [Add or modify a work item type, Add a custom WIT to a backlog or board ](../../reference/add-modify-wit.md). 

## Common fields for most work item types 

The following table describes common fields used to filter queries. The **ID** fields uniquely identify work items in a list. Use the **Title** field to distinguish the work item from all others of the same type.  The **Description** and other rich-text (data type=HTML) fields provide additional information that is needed to implement work and track changes. After a work item is created, you can modify all fields except for the **ID**. When you add and save a work item, the ID is assigned by the system and cannot be changed. 

>**Note:**&#160;&#160;The system automatically indexes all long-text fields with a data type of **PlainText** and **HTML** fields for full-text search. This includes the **Title**, **Description**, and **Steps to Repro** fields. For more information and  server and collation requirements applicable to on-premises TFS, see [Query fields, operators, values, and variables - Full-text and partial word searches](query-operators-variables.md#full-text).

####Notes:   

0. To learn more about working with rich-text fields, see [Share information within work items](share-plans.md#rich-text).   
0. Upon upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012, the Description field was changed from a field type of PlainText to **HTML**. Using the **witadmin changefield** command you can revert the data type for this field. See [Manage work item fields (witadmin)](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md).
