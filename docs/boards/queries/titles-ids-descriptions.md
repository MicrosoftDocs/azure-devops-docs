# Query by titles, IDs, and rich-text fields

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

When you want to find work items based on a keyword or phrase, you can do so by using single-line text (String), multi-line text (PlainText), and rich-text (HTML) fields. 

## Supported operators and macros 

Query clauses that specify a text or rich-text field can use the operators and macros listed in the following table.

<table valign="top">
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="22%"><p>Data type</p></th>
<th width="78%"><p>Supported operators and macros</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
    <td><p> <strong>Rich-text (HTML)</strong> </p></td>
    <td>Contains Words, Does Not Contain Words, Is Empty<sup>1</sup>, Is Not Empty<sup>1</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><strong>Multi-line text strings (PlainText)</strong> </td>
    <td>Contains Words, Does Not Contain Words, Is Empty<sup>1</sup>, Is Not Empty<sup>1</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><strong>Single text (String)</strong> </td>
    <td>= , &lt;&gt; , &gt; , &lt; , &gt;= , &lt;= , =[Field], &lt;&gt;[Field], &gt;[Field], &lt;[Field], &gt;=[Field], &lt;=[Field], Contains, Does Not Contain, In, Not In, In Group, Not In Group, Was Ever
    <p><strong>Macros</strong>: <strong>[Any]</strong>, valid with the <strong>Work Item Type</strong> field<br/>
    <strong><xref href="Project" data-throw-if-not-resolved="False" data-raw-source="@Project"></xref></strong><sup>2</sup>, valid with the <strong>Team Project</strong> field </p>
    </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Notes:  
1. The **Is Empty** and **Is Not Empty** operators are supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019 RC2 and later versions
2. The <strong>@Project</strong> macro is supported for Azure Boards and TFS 2015.1 and later versions. The system automatically defaults to filtering based on the current project. To learn more, see [Query across projects](using-queries.md#across-projects). 


<a id="keyword"/>

## Keyword or phrase query

Use **Contains** or **Contains Words** to list items that partially or exactly match the words or phrase that you enter.  

![Editor for flat list query for filtering key words](_img/example-work-item-queries/IC675039.png)   

Choose **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** to search against exact or partial matches of a word or phrase. Choose **Contains Words** or **Does Not Contain Words** to search against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, <b>*</b>. These operators use the full-text search index.


<a id="undefined-value"/>

## Undefined field value queries

You can find work items that have an undefined field value by using the equals operator (=) and leaving the Value for the field blank. For example, the following filters will list all work items of type Task whose Activity field is blank.  

![Filter based on blank entries](_img/example-work-item-queries/IC736440.png)

To list work items based on a field that isn't blank, use the not operator (<>) and leave the Value blank.


::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

<a id="empty"/>

## Empty or not empty HTML field queries

You can find work items where no **Description** has been entered. Using the **Is Empty** or **Is Not Empty** with an HTML field supports listing work items with empty or not empty rich text fields. You don't specify a value with this operator.  

For example, the following query filters will list all work items where some entries have been made into the **Description** field.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Filter based non-empty HTML fields](_img/example-queries/is-not-empty-query.png)

::: moniker-end

<a id="category"/>

## Category based queries

To filter work items based on the category they belong to, use the **In Group** operator. For example, the following filter criteria will return all work items that are in the current project, assigned to the team member, and defined as belonging to the Bug Category.

![Query clause to find work items by category](_img/example-work-item-queries/IC720125.png)

<a id="category"/>

## What items appear in the Requirement or Task categories? 

The default assignments of work item types to each category are listed below for each process.  

| Process | Requirement category | Task category |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Basic | Issue | Task |
| Agile | User Story | Task |
| Scrum | Product Backlog Item, Bug | Task |
| CMMI | Requirement | Task |

However, each team can determine if the Bug work item type appears in either the Requirement or Task category. See [Show bugs on backlogs and boards](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md). Also, you can add custom work item types to a backlog. For details, see [Add or modify a work item type, Add a custom WIT to a backlog or board](../../reference/add-modify-wit.md). 

## Common fields for most work item types 

The following table describes common fields used to filter queries. The **ID** fields uniquely identify work items in a list. Use the **Title** field to distinguish the work item from all others of the same type.  The **Description** and other rich-text (data type=HTML) fields provide additional information that is needed to implement work and track changes. After a work item is created, you can modify all fields except for the **ID**. When you add and save a work item, the ID is assigned by the system and cannot be changed. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The system automatically indexes all long-text fields with a data type of **PlainText** and **HTML** fields for full-text search. This includes the **Title**, **Description**, and **Steps to Repro** fields. For more information and  server and collation requirements applicable to on-premises TFS, see [Query fields, operators, values, and variables - Full-text and partial word searches](query-operators-variables.md#full-text).

#### Notes:   

1. To learn more about working with rich-text fields, see [Share information within work items](share-plans.md#rich-text).   
1. Upon upgrade to Team Foundation Server 2012, the Description field was changed from a field type of PlainText to **HTML**. Using the **witadmin changefield** command you can revert the data type for this field. See [Manage work item fields (witadmin)](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md).
