# Query by assignment or workflow changes
 
[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Workflow states support tracking the status of work as it moves from a new state to a closed or a done state. Kanban query fields support tracking the status of work as it moves from one column or swimlane to another on the Kanban board.  

Each workflow consists of a set of states,  valid transitions between  states, and reasons for transitioning the work item to the selected state. [Workflow states and reasons](../work-items/guidance/choose-process.md#workflow-states) differ among the work item types (WITs) and default processes used to create your project. 

Most work items move from a New, Active, or Proposed state to a Done or Closed state. As each work item moves from one state to another, the item might also be reassigned to various members of the team. For example, a tester might create a bug that is assigned to another team member during triage. When the other team member resolves the bug, it is reassigned to the tester who created it.  

<a id="reactivated"/> 

For example, you can find all work items that were closed but then reactivated. By specifying the Changed Date field, you can focus on reactivations that occurred today, yesterday, or in the last week.

![Query Editor filter for reactivated items](_img/query-reactivated-items.png)  

You can also use the Activated By and Activated Date fields, or other workflow fields.

> [!TIP]  
>Not all fields are valid for all WITs. Jump to [Workflow and Kanban query fields](#workflow-fields) for the set of fields you can include in queries and which WITs they apply to.  

If you're new to creating queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](using-queries.md).  



<a id="me"/>
## Query by assignment and account-specific fields 

You can use the search box or query editor to quickly find work items based on assignment.  Also, you can filter for work items based on who changed, resolved, or closed a work item. By specifying a time period, you can scope your query even further which can help with performance. 

Use **=** to find current assignments, **Was Ever** to list items based on past assignments, and @Me to scope to your account name.

<a id="group" /> 

## Query by membership in a group  

To filter on items assigned to someone who belongs to a team or security group, use the **In Group** operator.

![Filter based on assignment to a TFS security group](_img/example-work-item-queries/IC675038.png)  

You can use the **In Group** or **Not In Group** operators to filter a query based on several values that are members of a group, or that are not members of a group. Examples of groups are teams, built-in security groups, custom security groups, Active Directory groups, and work item categories.

> [!NOTE]    
> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
> **In Group** clauses don't support references to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups.

<a id="workflow-change"/> 

## Query based on workflow changes

You use the State, Reason, and Resolved Reason fields to query for items based on workflow changes.

## Query by who made workflow changes

You can quickly find items that you changed, resolved or closed. You can also find items that were changed by other team members. Several fields&mdash;such as the Created By, Changed By, Resolved By, and Closed By&mdash;are populated based on changes to the workflow.  

<table valign="top">

  <th>Include these query clauses</th>

## Query by Kanban board changes  
Using the Kanban query fields&mdash;Board Column, Board Column Done, and Board Lane&mdash;you can list work items according to their flow status on the Kanban board. And, you can create a [status or trend chart](../../report/dashboards/charts.md) based on these queries. 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]   
> Kanban query fields are available with TFS 2015.1 or later versions. 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"

For example, you can list items based on the team area path, and if they are in a specific custom Kanban column and swimlane. If you rename a column or swimlane, you'll need to update the query filters to reflect the new name. For more ideas, see this blog post: [New fields bring Kanban goodness to queries, and more](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/10/19/new-fields-bring-kanban-goodness-to-queries-and-more/)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Work items that appear on more then one team's Kanban board can yield query results that don't meet your expectations. Because each team can customize the Kanban board columns and swimlanes, the values assigned to work items which appear on different boards may not be the same. The primary work around for this issue is to maintain single ownership of work items by [team area path](../../organizations/settings/set-team-defaults.md). Another option is to [add custom workflow states](../../reference/customize-work.md) which all teams can use.

<a id="workflow-fields">  </a>

## Workflow and Kanban board fields
You can use the following fields to filter your queries or build reports. Some of these fields are populated with information as a work item progresses from one state to another, or you move an item in the [Kanban board](../boards/kanban-basics.md) to a different column or swimlane. Several of these fields do not appear on the work item form, but they are tracked for those WITs listed in the following table.

For information about data types and default field attributes, see [Work item data type reference](../../reference/xml/define-modify-work-item-fields.md).

#### Notes
  
<a id="sync">  </a>
1.  By default, the server synchronizes system-defined person-name fields with Active Directory or Azure Active Directory, if these are configured. These fields include: Activated By, Assigned To, Closed By, Created By, and Resolved By. You can grant access to a project by adding security groups that you created in AD or Azure AD or by adding accounts to existing or custom groups defined from the collection setting **Security** page. See [Set up Active Directory or Azure Active Directory](../../organizations/security/setup-ad-aad.md).
    
	::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"  
	You can enable or disable synchronization for a person-name field by using the **witadmin changefields** command-line tool. You can also synchronize custom person-name fields by specifying the **syncnamechanges** attribute. See [Manage work item fields](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md) and [FIELD (Definition) element reference](../../reference/xml/field-definition-element-reference.md).    
	::: moniker-end

2.  Reportable field with attribute set to Dimension. Reportable data is exported to the data warehouse and can be included in Excel or SQL Server reports. For on-premises TFS, use the [**witadmin changefield**](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md) command to change the reportable attribute for a field.  

3.  Indexed field. Enabling indexing for a field may increase the performance of finding work items whose queries specify that field. For on-premises TFS, use the [**witadmin indexfield** command](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md) to change the index attribute for a field.  

4. This field applies to all work item types that appear on the Kanban board. This includes all WITs added to the Requirement Category and may include those added to the Bug Category based on the team setting for [Show bugs on boards and backlogs](../../organizations/settings/show-bugs-on-backlog.md). 
	If you want to modify a board-related field, such as Board Column or Board Lane, from the work item form, you must add it to the form. For more information, see [Add or modify a work item field](../../reference/add-modify-field.md).
