# Query work item history and discussion fields in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

The history of a work item tells you who opened the item, what changed, and why. This information helps you track how an item changes over time. When you enter information in the history field, provide as much information as possible to help the next work item owner understand what has happened and what they have to do.  

> [!NOTE]  
> There is no Discussion work item field. To query work items with comments entered in the Discussion area, you filter on the History field. The full content of the text entered into the Discussion text box is added to the History field. 

## Supported operators and macros 

Query clauses that specify the **History** field can use the **Contains Words** and **Does Not Contain Words** operators. Search against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, *. You can only use the wildcard character at the end of a partial word or phrase.

The **History** field is automatically indexed for full-text search when full-text search is available. See Full-Text and partial word searches 

<a id="query-history" />

## Query a work item's history 

You can use either the web portal or Team Explorer to view the history of a work item or find work items based on the contents of the **History** field. When you run a search on the contents of the **History**  field, it returns only work items that have changes recorded in that field. That is, it doesn't register changes that were made to text in other fields.

<a id="tee-query-history" />
<a id="team-explorer" />


The **Query Editor** isn't available when you're connected to GitHub or third-party Git repository. Also, it isn't available from Visual Studio 2019 under the following conditions:   
* If you're set to use the default Landing page experience as described in [Set the Work Items experience in Visual Studio 2019](../work-items/set-work-item-experience-vs.md).  
* If you're set to use the new Git Tool as described in [Git experience in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/ide/git-with-visual-studio).  
 

**Visual Studio/Team Explorer and Team Explorer Everywhere**

## List items based on the contents of the History field  

You use the query editor to add the **History** field to a [query clause](using-queries.md). Comments entered into the **Discussion** area are queryable. Change history entries, such as which fields were changed, aren't queryable. To quickly find items based on words entered into the Discussion area, or **Description** or other rich-text fields, consider using [work item search](../../project/search/functional-work-item-search.md).

You can filter for work items by the date on which they were changed or for a specific time period. If you limit the scope of your query, it can help with performance by only returning those results that fit the date range that you want to include.

### Tips for using the query editor

- Type the complete word or phrase that is specified in the **History** field of those work items that you want to find.
- Enter the full text for the word that you want to search. The **History** field is indexed for full-text search. If you enter only a partial word, the query won't return work items that contain the full word. For example, if the **History** field contains the phrase *reproducible behavior* and you search for *repro*, the work item won't be found. However, if you search for the complete word *reproducible*, the work item will be found. You can also search for the string with a wild card, such as `repro*`. 
- The query editor ignores common words or stop words as defined in  [Configure and Manage Stopwords and Stoplists for Full-Text Search](/sql/relational-databases/search/configure-and-manage-stopwords-and-stoplists-for-full-text-search).
- On the query editor toolbar, choose ![Run query](../media/icons/run_query.png) or ![Run query, earlier version](../media/icons/run_query_te.png) icon and confirm that your query returns expected results. 
- If you don&#39;t receive the results you expect, adjust the word or phrase that you entered, and run the query again.

## View the history of work items  

An entry is made to the **History** field each time a work item is saved. To view the history of changes, open an existing work item, and then choose the ![history tab icon](../media/icons/icon-history-tab-wi.png) or **History** tab, or for some work item types, choose the **Details** tab. 

<a id="web-portal-explorer-tab" /> 
The history details shown depend on the platform, version, and client. 

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

<a id="team-services-tab" /> 
<a id="team-services-view" /> 

:::image type="content" source="media/hist-audit-wi-form-vsts-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Work item form, Web portal, Choose History tab.":::

The state change history diagram appears first. To see the entire history of state changes, choose **Show all**.

:::image type="content" source="media/state-change-history-diagram.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Work item form, Web portal, State change history diagram (web portal only).":::

Choose an entry in the left pane to view the details of changes made.

:::image type="content" source="media/hist-audit-wi-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Work item form, History tab, Web portal, Details.":::

#### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)

To view only the comments that were added to the log, choose the **Discussion Only** tab. To view all changes made to the item, choose the **All Changes** tab, and then choose the **show all changes** link for a specific date and time.

## Filter the history view 

The **History** tab is designed to track all changes made to a work item to support full traceability. The long revision history that results can make it difficult to understand when changes happen to specific fields. To quickly find revisions made to a specific field or by specific people, filter the history view. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The **Toggle filter** feature requires you to enable the **New Boards Hub** preview feature. To enable this feature, see [Manage or enable features](../../project/navigation/preview-features.md).

You enable the filter feature by choosing :::image type="icon" source="media/history-audit/filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Toggle filter**.

:::image type="content" source="media/history-audit/history-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Work item form, History tab, Web portal, history filter enabled.":::

To review updates by specific people, select their names from the **Updated by** menu. 

:::image type="content" source="media/history-audit/filter-history-people.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Work item form, History tab, Filter by who made updates.":::

To review updates made to one or more fields, select the fields from the **Fields** menu.

## Fields that support history, auditing, and revision tracking 

You can use the following fields to filter queries and create reports. Several of these fields are populated with information as a work item progresses from one state to another. Other fields update when the work item is modified. Some fields don't appear on the work item form, but they're tracked for the WITs listed.

   The record of changes that were made to the work item after it was created. Every time that the work item is updated, information is appended to the history, which specifies the date of the change, who made the changes, and which fields were changed.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > History field queries return work items whose **Discussion** comments or **Description** fields contain words that match the keywords entered. You can't use the History field to query on changes made to other fields.  

   You can't add formatted text to the history field. Once you've saved the work item, you can't alter the history.  
   The `History` field, along with the `Description`, `Steps to Repro` and `Title` fields are automatically indexed for full-text search as described in [Query fields, operators, and macros](query-operators-variables.md).

> [!NOTE]  
> 1. For these fields to be defined for a WIT, they must be included in the `WORKFLOW` section of the WIT definition. For example, this syntax is included within the `FIELDS` definition when transitioning to a Resolved state:
> 
>    ```xml
>    <FIELD refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ResolvedDate">  
>       <SERVERDEFAULT from="clock" />  
>    </FIELD>  
>     ```
