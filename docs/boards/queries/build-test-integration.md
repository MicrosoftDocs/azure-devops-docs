# Create a query based on build and test integration fields

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Work item fields that support build and test integration support the following actions:  
-   Associate bugs with the builds where they were found or fixed  
-   Query for bugs associated with a build 
-   Mark test cases as either manual or automated, and store information to support automated test cases  
-   For test cases and shared steps, define the action and validation steps and the data that are used to run tests.

<!--- include information on limits of querying by test case -->  


## Supported operators and macros 

Most build and test integration fields have a data type of String, PlainText, or HTML. Query clauses that specify a text or rich-text field can use the operators and macros listed in the following table.

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Data type**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   **Supported operators and macros**
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
    **Rich-text (HTML)** and  
    **Multi-line text strings (PlainText)** 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   `Contains Words`, `Does Not Contain Words`, `Is Empty`, `Is Not Empty`.   
   The `Is Empty` and `Is Not Empty` operators are supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019 RC2 and later versions. 
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Single text (String)** 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
   `= , <> , > , < , >= , <= , =[Field], <>[Field], >[Field], <[Field], >=[Field], <=[Field]`, `Contains`, `Does Not Contain`, `In`, `Not In`, `In Group`, `Not In Group`, `Was Ever`  
   **Macros**: `[Any]`, valid with the **Work Item Type** field; and `@Project`, valid with the **Team Project** field. The system automatically defaults to filtering based on the current project. To learn more, see [Query across projects](using-queries.md#across-projects).

## List bugs and the test cases that test them

Open a new query, set the query type to Work items and direct links. Filter for bugs in the top level and add the filter for Test Cases in the linked work items filter. 

![List bugs and the test cases that test them](media/query-build-integration-bugs-linked-test-cases.png)

> [!NOTE]    
>You can't construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases. These items aren't linked together using parent-child link types. You can [view the hierarchy through the **Test>Test Plans** page](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md).

### Fields that integrate with Team Foundation Build

Team Foundation Build is the on-premise build system you can use with Azure DevOps Server and TFS. You can configure your build process by using Team Foundation Build, and Team Foundation Build can generate work items when a build fails. It can also add build information to work items that were resolved in a particular build. For this to work, Team Foundation Build requires that the following two fields be added to the work item type definition: **Found In** and **Integration Build**.

**Found In** and **Integrated in Build** fields are defined for Bugs in the default processes. These fields associate bugs with the builds where they were found or fixed. 

You can use the following code snippet to add these fields to a WIT definition.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <FIELD name="Found In" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn" type="String" reportable="dimension">
>     <HELPTEXT>Product build number (revision) in which this item was found</HELPTEXT>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>           <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
> </FIELD>
> <FIELD name="Integration Build" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.IntegrationBuild" type="String" reportable="dimension">
>     <HELPTEXT>Product build number this bug was fixed in</HELPTEXT>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>           <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
> </FIELD>
> ```


When the **Found In** field is present in a WIT definition, Team Foundation Build creates a work item when a build fails, and sets the **Found In** field to the build number of the build that failed. If the **Found In** field is missing, Team Foundation Build doesn't create a work item for the failed build, and everything else works as expected.

When the **Integration Build** field is present in the WIT definition, Team Foundation Build identifies work items that were resolved with each build and then updates those work items to set the build number in which they were resolved in the **Integration Build** field. If the **Integration Build** field is missing, Team Foundation Build doesn't store the build number in the work items, and everything else works as expected.


<a id="global-list" /> 

### Builds and global list autopopulation

The first time you queue a build for a project using Team Foundation Build, TFS automatically adds a global list labeled <strong>Build - <em>ProjectName</em></strong>. Each time a build is run, a <strong>LISTITEM</strong> is added to this global list with the name of the build.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

By adding a **GLOBALLIST** element to the **FIELD** definition, you can provide a drop-down menu of builds that users can choose from. For example:

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <FIELD name="Found In" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Build.FoundIn" type="String" reportable="dimension">
>     <HELPTEXT>Product build number (revision) in which this item was found</HELPTEXT>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>           <LISTITEM value="&lt;None&gt;" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
>         <SUGGESTEDVALUES expanditems="true" filteritems="excludegroups">
>           <GLOBALLIST name="Builds - TeamProjectName" />
>         </SUGGESTEDVALUES>
> </FIELD>
> ```

::: moniker-end


<a id="tf-build" /> 

### Fields that Integrate with Test Plans

With Test Plans, you can automate the creation of a bug or other type of work item when a test fails. For more information, see <a href="../../test/add-to-bugs-exploratory-testing.md" data-raw-source="[Add findings to existing bugs with exploratory testing](../../test/add-to-bugs-exploratory-testing.md)">Add findings to existing bugs with exploratory testing</a>.

When a work item has been created in this manner, information about the system and the steps to reproduce the bug are captured in the **System Info** and **Repro Steps** fields.

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
You can add these fields to work item types that you create for tracking defects using the following code snippet.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```XML
> <FIELD name="System Info" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.SystemInfo" type="HTML" />
> <FIELD name="Repro Steps" refname="Microsoft.VSTS.TCM.ReproSteps" type="HTML" />
> ```

::: moniker-end

### Fields that integrate with Team Foundation Version Control

One of the features available in Team Foundation version control (TFVC) enables you to associate or resolve work items when you check in code. You might have worked on a particular work item when you make a code change and you can set that association from within the source-control check-in window when you're finished working on the code.

The ability of Team Foundation version control to resolve a work item requires that work items contain a particular action. The source control system then queries work item tracking to determine whether the work item supports that action, and if it does support that action, it also queries for the source and destination states of the transition. If the action is found, the source control system can transition the work item according to the set transition when it checks in the code.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use the **Checkin** action, you must set appropriate *from* and *to* states to reflect the state transition that you want.

For more information about Actions, see [Automate field assignments based on State, Transition, or Reason](../../reference/xml/automate-field-assignments-state-transition-reason.md).
