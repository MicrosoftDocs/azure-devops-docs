# Link type reference 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

<a id="link-type-guidance"></a>

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
Four link types are supported. A specific field maintains a count of links for each of these link types. 

- [**Work link types**](#work-link-types) support creating relationships among work items including select test case management work items
- [**Remote work link types**](#remote-work-link-types) support creating relationships among work items that are defined in different organizations
- [**Hyperlink**](#hyperlink) supports linking a work item to any URL or network share
- [**External link types**](#external-link-types) supports connecting a work item to an external object, such as a code object, build, or wiki page.

::: moniker range="<= azure-devops-2019"  
Three link types are supported. A specific field maintains a count of links for each of these link types. 

- [**Work link types**](#work-link-types) support creating relationships among work items including select test case management work items
- [**Hyperlink**](#hyperlink) supports linking a work item to any URL or network share
- [**External link types**](#external-link-types) supports connecting a work item to an external object, such as a code object, build, or storyboard.

Link types you use to link work items are subject to certain restrictions based on their topology. Use the guidance provided in the following tables to choose which link type to use based on the types of queries and reports you'll want to create.  To learn more about the different topologies, see [Link type topologies and restrictions](../../reference/xml/link-type-element-reference.md#topology).


<a id="work-link-types">  </a>
## Work link types

Work link types are system-defined, process-defined, or user-defined (custom). The links listed in the following table are system defined. 

Each work link type defines the link labels, topology type, and restrictions that are used when links between work items are constructed. For example, the parent-child link type defines two labels (Parent and Child), supports a hierarchical or tree topology, and prevents circular references from being created between work items. 

![Work item link types, conceptual image](_img/link-type-reference/linkscontrol-work-item-link-types.png)


A work item's [*Related Link Count*](linking-attachments.md#related-link-count) corresponds to the sum of all links defined with a work link type.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 <= azure-devops-2019"  
The following table describes the work item link types you can specify to scope a links control using the [**WorkItemLinksFilter** XML element](../../reference/xml/linkscontroloptions-xml-elements.md).

Use this directional link to create one-to-many relationships between a single parent to one or more child items. Use to organize work item within a hierarchy. You can quickly create this hierarchy among backlog items using the [mapping function](../backlogs/organize-backlog.md) or among backlog items and tasks using the [sprint backlog](../sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) or [task board](../sprints/task-board.md).
<p>Typical uses include:</p> 
<ul>
<li><p>Create a work breakdown structure (WBS). See [Schedule tasks and assign resources using Microsoft Project](../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md).</p></li><li><p>Map backlog items to portfolio backlog items.

## Remote work link types

Remote work link types are system-defined link types that support linking work items defined in different organizations. Organizations must be managed by the same Azure Active Directory.  

A work item's [*Remote Link Count*](linking-attachments.md#remote-link-count) corresponds to the sum of all links defined with a remote work link type.

## Hyperlink type

There is one link type that tracks the number of hyperlinks&mdash;[*Hyperlink Count*](linking-attachments.md#hyper-link-count)&mdash; added to a work item. A hyperlink can link a work item to any URL.

## External link types

External link types are system-defined link types. They support linking work items to other objects as shown in the following image. A work item's [*External Link Count*](linking-attachments.md#external-link-count) corresponds to the sum of all links defined with a external link type.
