# Query by link or attachment count  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../includes/version-all.md)]

You can [link work items to track related work and dependencies](link-work-items-support-traceability.md) and [attach files to share information with your team](share-plans.md#attachments). You can then list work items based on one or more of the following fields:

::: moniker range="azure-devops"  
- Attachment File Count
- (Discussion) Comment Count 
- External Link count
- Hyperlink Count
- Link Comment
- Related Link Count
- Remote Link Count
::: moniker-end 


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017 < azure-devops" 
- Attachment File Count
- (Discussion) Comment Count 
- External Link count
- Hyperlink Count
- Link Comment
- Related Link Count
::: moniker-end 


::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015" 
- Attachment File Count
- External Link count
- Hyperlink Count
- Link Comment
- Related Link Count
::: moniker-end 

For descriptions of each of these fields, see the [table provided later in this article](#table-field). 

## Supported operators and macros 

Query clauses that specify an integer field can use the operators listed below.

`= , <> , > , < , >= , <= ,`  
`=[Field], <>[Field], >[Field], <[Field], >=[Field], <=[Field],`   
`In, Not In,`   
`Was Ever`  

## Link or attachment count queries

You can filter for work items by the link type, link count, or attachment count.

## List hierarchical items in a tree view  

Add a query and select **Tree of work items** to begin your query. You should see something similar to the following: 

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

* * *


> [!NOTE]
> You can't construct a query that shows a hierarchical view of Test Plans, Test Suites, and Test Cases. These items aren't linked together using parent-child link types. However, you can create a Direct links query that lists test-related work items. Also, you can, [view the hierarchy through the Test>Test Plans page](../../test/create-a-test-plan.md). 

From there, you can add query clauses or change the filter options for linked work items.

<a id="dependents" />

## List items based on linked dependents  

The following example shows a dependent linked query that returns items with dependencies on work managed by other teams and projects. 

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

The following query finds work items in all projects that are linked to work items under the **Fabrikam** area path and project using Predecessor and Successor link types.

:::image type="content" source="media/link-attachments/direct-links-query-web-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Query Editor, Work items and direct links, Web portal.":::

**Why this works:**

- Checking the **Query across projects** checkbox enables all dependent linked work items that match the filter criteria to be listed, no matter which project they belong to.

- Specifying the **Area Path Under Fabrikam** clause indicates to find only work items that are linked to work items defined under the Fabrikam project.   

- Specifying **Only return items that have matching links**, and **Return selected link types** causes the query to return only work items that are linked based on the **Predecessor** and **Successor** link types.  


#### [Visual Studio 2015](#tab/visual-studio/)

Use this type of query to list all dependent work items that link to active Product Backlog Items or Bugs that haven't been removed, closed, or completed. Only those dependent work items that are under a product area other than the **Phone Save\Phone Customers** are returned.

![Work Items and Dependent Links Query](media/example-work-item-queries/IC588290.png)   

**Why this works:**

- Removing the <strong>Team Project = @Project</strong> clause enables all dependent linked work items that match the filter criteria to be listed, no matter which project they belong to in the collection.

- Grouping each of two clauses returns all **Product Backlog Item**s on the backlog or in progress, and the second grouped clause returns all **Bug**s on the backlog or in progress.

- Grouping the two clauses with the **OR** operator at the start of the second clause returns work items that match either of the two filter criteria.

- Choosing the **Only return items that have the specified links** returns only top-level work items that have dependencies.

- Choosing **Return links of any type** returns all linked work items that match the filter criteria for linked work items, in this case, returning all work items that are not under the **Phone Saver\\Phone Customers** area path, and aren't completed or removed.

The following image shows the query results that are returned.

<a id="orphan-stories" />

## List orphan user stories 

If you typically organize your user stories under features, you can quickly find  user stories that are orphan by opening the product backlog, enable **Parents On** view option, and scroll down to the section that lists **Unparented Stories** (Agile) or **Unparented Backlog items** (Scrum).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![List orphan stories or backlog items](media/link-attachments/list-orphan-stories.png) 

Or, you can find unparented backlog items using a **Work items and direct links** query. For example, the following query lists active user stories for the Azure DevOps team that don't have a Parent link.

## Link and attachment count and comment fields 

The following table describes fields associated with links and attachments. Most of these fields don't appear within the work item form, but are tracked for all work item types.

### Visualize related work and other objects 

You can view related work items and object within a work item form by installing the [Work item visualization extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.WorkItemVisualization) available from the Visual Studio Marketplace, Azure DevOps tab. 
::: moniker-end 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 < azure-devops" 

### Add custom link types or customize the links controls 

To add link types, see [Manage link types [witadmin]](../../reference/witadmin/manage-link-types.md). 

All tabs that support creating links between work items are implemented by using the **LinksControl** element on the work item form. This element controls filtering and restricting the types of work items to which you can link, the types of links that you can create, and whether you can link to work items in another project. To customize the link controls and restrictions, you modify the definition of the `LinksControlOptions` for a work item type, see [LinksControlOptions XML elements](../../reference/xml/linkscontroloptions-xml-elements.md).  

### Default data fields in lists of links

You can add or remove columns from the list of links, and you can customize the default columns and the column order. For more information, see [LinksControlOptions XML elements](../../reference/xml/linkscontroloptions-xml-elements.md).
