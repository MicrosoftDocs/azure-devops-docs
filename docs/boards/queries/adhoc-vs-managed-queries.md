# Ad hoc vs managed work item queries

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You have two ways to perform work item searches: semantic or ad hoc searches and managed queries. 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"  

You perform semantic or ad hoc searches using the work item search box (shown below)   

Choose any **Boards** page, enter a keyword or phrase in the search box, and press *Enter* or choose the ![ ](../../project/search/_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) start search icon.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Work Item Search box](../../project/navigation/_img/search/work-item-search-vert.png)    

You add and run managed queries using the built-in query-editor available from the **Boards>Queries** page.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

::: moniker-end   


::: moniker range="<= tfs-2018"  

You perform semantic or ad hoc searches using the work item search box (shown below). 

In the search box, check that the text says _Search work items_. If it doesn't, use the selector to select it. Enter a keyword or phrase in the search box, and press *Enter* or choose the ![ ](../../project/search/_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) start search icon.

For details about semantic or ad hoc searches, see [Perform a semantic or ad hoc work item search](search-box-queries.md). For details about managed queries, see [Create managed queries with the query editor](using-queries.md). 

### Use semantic or ad hoc searches to perform the following tasks:  
- Find a specific work item using its ID or a keyword 
- Find one or more work items across all projects in a fast, flexible manner
- Perform full text search across all work item fields
- Review work items assigned to a specific team member
- Search against specific work item fields to quickly narrow down a list of work items
- Determine what key words will support a managed search

### Use managed queries to perform the following tasks: |

- Review or triage a group of work items
- Perform bulk updates on several work items such as change Assign To, Iteration Path, or more
- Review parent-child or dependent links among work items
- Create a status or trend chart from a flat list query
- Create a list of work items that you'll export to [Excel](../backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](../backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md) 

> [!NOTE]    
> With semantic search, you search against a more fully indexed set of fields. With ad hoc search, the number of fields that are indexed are limited.
