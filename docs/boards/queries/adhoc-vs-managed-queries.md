# Adhoc vs managed work item queries

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

You have two ways to perform work item searches: semantic or adhoc searches and managed queries. 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation.md)]  

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

::: moniker range="vsts"  

You perform semantic or adhoc searches using the work item search box (shown below)   

Choose any **Boards** page, enter a keyword or phrase in the search box, and press *Enter* or choose the ![ ](../../project/search/_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) start search icon. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Work Item Search box, new navigation](../../project/navigation/_img/search/work-item-search-vert.png)    

You add and run managed queries using the built-in query-editor available from the **Boards>Queries** page.

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"   
[!INCLUDE [temp](../../_shared/new-navigation-not-supported.md)] 
::: moniker-end   


# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013"     

You perform semantic or adhoc searches using the work item search box (shown below). 

In the search box, check that the text says _Search work items_. If it doesn't, use the selector to select it. Enter a keyword or phrase in the search box, and press *Enter* or choose the ![ ](../../project/search/_img/_shared/start-search-icon.png) start search icon.

You add and run managed queries using the built-in query-editor available from the **Work>Queries** page.

> [!NOTE]    
> With semantic search, you search against a more fully indexed set of fields. With adhoc search, the number of fields that are indexed are limited.
