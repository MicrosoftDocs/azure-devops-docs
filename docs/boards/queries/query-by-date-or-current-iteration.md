# Query by date or current iteration in Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

To list work items based on when they were created, closed, resolved, or changed&mdash;you can specify a date or use a supported macro. Use the `@Today` macro and specify a plus or minus number of days for relative dates. For queries that list work items based on their assignment to a team's current sprint, use `@CurrentIteration`. 

For example, you can find work items that were modified in the last three days with the following query.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
:::image type="content" source="media/example-work-item-queries/query-changed-date-last-3-days.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Query Editor, Changed Date >= 3.":::
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
![Screenshot of query editor, filter based on recent changes.](media/query-by-date-example.png)  
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"
Also, you can use  the `CurrentIteration +/- _n_` macro to create queries based on a sliding window of team iterations. 
::: moniker-end


## Supported operators and macros 

Query clauses that specify a **DateTime** field or the **Iteration Path** can use the operators and macros listed in the following table.

#### Notes:
1. The  `@StartOfDay`, `@StartOfWeek`, `@StartOfMonth`, `@StartOfYear`  macros are supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019.1 and later versions, and only when run from the web portal.
2. The `@CurrentIteration +/- n` macro is supported for Azure DevOps Server 2019 and later versions, and only when run from the web portal. 

> [!TIP]    
> The `WasEver` operator can be used with the **Iteration Path** field but only when defined through the WIQL syntax. For an example, see [Work Item Query Language (WIQL) syntax reference](wiql-syntax.md#asof-historical-queries).
 

[!INCLUDE [date-time-pattern](../includes/date-time-pattern.md)]


<a id="team_view">  </a>
<a id="current_sprint_restrict"> </a> 

## Client restrictions on the use of the `@CurrentIteration` macros 

You can use the `@CurrentIteration` macro in a query from the following clients:

- Web portal that connects to Azure Boards
- Visual Studio 2019 or later versions connected to Azure Boards 
- Using the REST API.

You can use the `@CurrentIteration +/- n` macro in a query against Azure Boards, Azure DevOps Server 2019, and later versions, and with a REST API that includes the team as a parameter, for example, `@CurrentIteration('[Project]/Team')`.
  

An error occurs if you open a query that contains the `@CurrentIteration` macro in earlier versions of Visual Studio, or from Excel or Project. Also, you can't use the macro when [copying or cloning test suites and test cases](/previous-versions/azure/devops/test/mtm/copying-and-cloning-test-suites-and-test-cases), [defining alerts](../../notifications/about-notifications.md), or with [REST APIs](/rest/api/azure/devops/).


## Date-based queries  

You can filter for work items by the date on which they were changed or for a specific time period. Limiting the scope of your query can help with performance by only returning results that fit the date range that you include. If you're new to creating queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](using-queries.md). 

Not all fields are valid for all work item types. Jump to [date fields](#date_fields) for the set of fields you can include in queries and which work item types they apply to. 

> [!TIP] 
> Remember to enter dates in the **Date Pattern** you set for your [personal profile](../../organizations/settings/set-your-preferences.md).

## Create queries for your team's current iteration
 
If your team follows Scrum processes, you [schedule work to be completed in sprints](../sprints/define-sprints.md). You can track the progress of requirements, bugs, and other work to be completed in the current sprint using the **@CurrentIteration** macro.  

Any item assigned to a sprint that corresponds to the current iteration path for the team is found. For example, if a team is on Sprint 5, the query returns items assigned to Sprint 5. Later, when the team is working in Sprint 6, the same query returns items assigned to Sprint 6.  

> [!NOTE]
> For the **@CurrentIteration** macro to work, the team must have selected an **Iteration Path** whose date range encompasses the current date. For details, see [Define iteration paths (also referred to as sprints) and configure team iterations](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md#activate). Also, queries that contain this macro are only valid when run from the web portal.
> 
> See also [Client restrictions on the use of the @CurrentIteration macros](#current_sprint_restrict) later in this article.

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

Azure Boards adds a team parameter when you select the **@CurrentIteration** or **@CurrentIteration +/- _n_** macros. The team parameter is derived from your current [team context](#team_view). 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Query filter using the @CurrentIteration macro with team parameter](media/query-date-iteration/at-current-with-team-parameter.png)  

> [!TIP]  
> If the **@CurrentIteration** macro isn't working, check that the [expected iteration is selected for your team and that dates have been set for it](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md#activate). 

To change the team parameter the system automatically sets, you choose it by typing the name of the team into the parameter field added below the **@CurrentIteration** macro.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Choose team parameter](media/query-date-iteration/choose-team-parameter.png)

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2018"

Before creating or updating a query to use the **@CurrentIteration** macro, make sure you [select your team](#team_view). The **@CurrentIteration** macro references the current team selected in the web portal.

<a id="current-iteration-plus-minus-n">  </a>

## Create a sliding window of your team's iterations query 

Use the **@CurrentIteration +/- <i>n</i>** macro when you want to track the work a team has planned for upcoming sprints and for understanding work that wasn't completed in previous sprints. 

> [!NOTE]
> For the **@CurrentIteration +/- <i>n</i>** macro to work, the team must have selected **Iteration Paths** that meet the **+/- _n_**
> criteria and date ranges encompass the current date for the **@CurrentIteration**. For details about team selection of Iteration Paths, see [Define iteration (sprint) paths and configure team iterations](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md#activate). 
> 
> See also [Client restrictions on the use of the @CurrentIteration macros](#current_sprint_restrict) later in this article.

Here we show how to list all User Stories and Bugs that are assigned to the sliding window that spans the last two, the current, and the next two sprints selected for the *Cloud Admin and Tools* team. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![CurrentIteration plus and minus clauses](media//query-date-iteration/sliding-window-iterations.png)

To use this macro, the specified team must have [selected a set of sprints](../../organizations/settings/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md) that span the **+/- _n_** value entered for the macro.

## List work items moved out of a sprint 

You can list work items that were defined for a sprint but later moved out using a query with a clause that contains the **Was Ever** operator for the **Iteration Path**. You can only construct this query using the [WIQL syntax](wiql-syntax.md). You can edit the WIQL syntax in the Query Editor by installing the [Wiql Editor Marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor). 

For example, the following syntax queries for work items that meet the following criteria: 
1. Defined in the current project 
2. Work item type equals User Story or Bug
3. Work items are under the Fabrikam Fiber Web team Area Path 
4. Work items aren't in a Closed, Completed, Cut, or Resolved state
5. Not in the current iteration path for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team
6. But were assigned to the current iteration path for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team
7. Are now assigned to the Current iteration +1 for the Fabrikam Fiber Web team
8. And were changed within the last 30 days (the length of the sprint) 


> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```WIQL

    [System.AssignedTo],

    [System.IterationPath],
    [System.AreaPath]

    [System.TeamProject] = @project
    AND [System.WorkItemType] IN ('User Story', 'Bug')
    AND [System.AreaPath] UNDER 'FabrikamFiber\Web'
    AND NOT [System.State] IN ('Completed', 'Closed', 'Cut', 'Resolved')
    AND NOT [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web <id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>')
    AND (
        EVER (
            [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web <id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>')
        )
        AND [System.IterationPath] = @currentIteration('[FabrikamFiber]\Web <id:cdf5e823-1179-4503-9fb1-a45e2c1bc6d4>') + 1

```


The Query Editor view of the syntax appears as shown. 

> [!NOTE]   
> The Query Editor displays a :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/required-icon.png" border="false"::: information icon next to the **Was Ever** operator, indicating an issue with the clause. However, the query will still run and you can create query charts. However, to modify the query, you need to use the [WIQL editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ottostreifel.wiql-editor).

## List work items added to a sprint after the start date 

To list newly created work items added to a sprint after its start date, use a query similar to the one shown in the following image. This query works by filtering for work items assigned to the current sprint but were created after the start of the sprint date. In this example, this is achieved with the clause **created Date = @Today - 28**. 

:::image type="content" source="media/example-work-item-queries/query-work-items-added-to-sprint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Query Editor, Work Items newly created and added to a sprint after it's start date.":::

#### Notes:
 
1. See also [Query by assignment or workflow changes, Date, and Identity fields](query-by-workflow-changes.md).

1. For these fields to be defined for a WIT, they must be included in the ```WORKFLOW``` section of the WIT definition. For example, this syntax is included within the ```FIELDS``` definition when transitioning to a Resolved state:  
	```xml
	<FIELD refname="Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ResolvedDate" />  
	   <SERVERDEFAULT from="clock"  />  
	</FIELD >  
    ```

2. **Start Date** and **Finish Date** fields are calculated if you create a project plan in Microsoft Project and then synchronize that plan with tasks that are stored in Azure Boards. These fields might not appear on the work item form, but are calculated for the backlog items and tasks that are linked to backlog items. You can view their read-only values in results from a query or from Microsoft Excel.
