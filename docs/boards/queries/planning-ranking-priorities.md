# Query by rank and picklist value in Azure DevOps and Azure Boards

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

You use planning, ranking, and priority fields to specify which work the team should complete first.  By ranking and prioritizing work items, all team members gain an understanding of the relative importance of the work that they must accomplish.  

You rank and prioritize work items when you [Create your backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md).

## Supported operators and macros 

Query clauses that specify a string or integer field can use the operators listed below.
- = , <> , > , < , >= , <=  
- =[Field], <>[Field], >[Field], <[Field], >=[Field], <=[Field]  
- In, Not In  
- Was Ever  

<a id= "picklist-query-examples" />


## Picklist query examples 

Most of the planning fields described in the next section are either an integer or string field. For example queries of numeric or rich-text fields, see [Query by numeric fields](query-numeric.md) and [Query by titles, IDs, and rich-text fields](titles-ids-descriptions.md).   

To use the **In** and **Not In** operators, enter the names or labels of items that correspond to the selected field separated by a comma. For example, to filter for **Work Item Types** that are either user stories or bugs, add the clause: `Work Item Types In User Story,Bug`.  

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Filter for**
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="1":::
   **Include these query clauses**
   :::column-end:::

**Notes:**  
1.  To change the menu selection, see [Add and manage fields (Inherited process)](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-field.md) or [Add or modify a field, customize a picklist (On-premises XML process)](../../reference/add-modify-field.md).  
2. The sequence of items on a product backlog page is determined according to where you have added or dragged the items. As you drag items, a background process updates either the Backlog Priority (Scrum) or Stack Rank (Agile, Basic, CMMI) field. These fields determine the order in which backlog items appear on a backlog page. They are assigned to `type="Order"` in the ProcessConfiguration file.  


## More about Backlog Priority or Stack Rank fields

The Backlog Priority and Stack Rank fields don't appear on the work item forms. (To learn why, see [Where is the field on the work item form to order the backlog?](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/where-is-the-field-on-the-work-item-form-to-order-the-backlog).

To add the field to the form:

- For an Inherited process, add the Stack Rank field to a work item type ([for the custom process that your project references](../../organizations/settings/work/customize-process-form.md)).
- For an On-premises XML process, add the field to the form, [modify the WIT XML definition to add the following control element](../../reference/add-modify-wit.md):

    ```xml
    <Control FieldName="Microsoft.VSTS.Common.StackRank" Type="FieldControl" Label="Stack Rank" LabelPosition="Left" />
    ```

    or, for Scrum:

    ```xml
    <Control FieldName="Microsoft.VSTS.Common.BacklogPriority" Type="FieldControl" Label="Stack Rank" LabelPosition="Left" />
    ```
