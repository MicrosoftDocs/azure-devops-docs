# Query fields, operators, and macros in Azure Boards 

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)] 

Here you'll find detailed descriptions of each field data type, query operators, and query macros. Some data types, operators, and macros are only valid for the indicated Azure DevOps Server or Team Foundation Server (TFS) version. 

For a quick reference of query tasks and operators and macros supported for each data type, see [Query quick reference](query-index-quick-ref.md). See also [Guidance to create high-performing queries](high-performing-queries.md) for tips on constructing high-performing queries.

<a id="field-values" /> 

## Query field data types and values

The value you specify for a field must conform to the data type for that field. The following table lists the supported data types:

> [!NOTE]   
> For Azure Boards cloud service, the data type corresponds to that listed for the field on the [Process>Fields page](../work-items/work-item-fields.md#review-fields). For on-premises deployments, the data type corresponds to the `type` attribute assigned to a [`FIELD` definition](../../reference/xml/field-definition-element-reference.md). For more information, see [Work item fields and field attributes](../work-items/work-item-fields.md).

## Query operators

You can use query operators in the following table to specify how each value in a clause must relate to the corresponding value in a work item. For information about the data type that is assigned to work item fields, see [Work item field reference](../work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md). 

To learn about adding clauses and use of the And/Or operators, see [Define a query, And/Or logical expression](using-queries.md#andor-logical-expression).

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::


> [!TIP] 
> It's possible to contruct a query using WIQL syntax that uses an operator, such as **Was Ever**, for other data type fields than those listed. For example, you can use **Was Ever** within a clause using the **Iteration Path**. For an example, see [Query by date or current iteration, List work items moved out of a sprint](query-by-date-or-current-iteration.md#list-work-items-moved-out-sprint).

:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      **[Any]** 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
      Use with the **Work Item Type** or **State** fields to search across all work item types or across all states. For example, <code>Work Item Type=[Any]</code> won't place any filters based on the work item type.
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      **@CurrentIteration**  
   :::column-end:::

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::
---
:::row:::
   :::column span="1":::
      **@Project** 
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="3":::
      Use with the **Team Project** field to filter for work items in other projects. For example, you can find all the work items in the currently selected project with the clause <code>Team Project=@Project</code>. The system automatically defaults to filtering based on the current project. To learn more, see [Define a query, Query across projects](using-queries.md#across-projects).

## Full-text and partial word searches

Specify **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** to search against exact or partial matches of a word or phrase. These operators filter items based on the full-text search index created for long-text fields. Specify **Contains Words** or **Does Not Contain Words** to search against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, **&#42;**. These operators use the full-text search index. You can only use the wildcard character at the end of a partial word or phrase.

For examples, see [Example work item queries](query-index-quick-ref.md) and [Query for work items using the History field](history-and-auditing.md).


> [!NOTE]    
> Not all deployments support full-text searches. For example, SQL Express and SQL Azure, which support the cloud service, do not support full-text search. In these instances, you will only see the **Contains** and **Does not Contain** operators.


::: moniker range="< azure-devops"
Azure DevOps Server and Team Foundation Server automatically index all long-text fields with a data type of **PlainText** and **HTML** and the **Title** field for full-text search. The index and operators are only available when the SQL Server that supports Team Foundation Server supports full-text search.

Full-text searches require a SQL collation that corresponds to a language that has a word breaker registered with SQL Server. If the collation settings for the project collection database used for your Team Foundation Server instance don't correspond to a supported language, your search results may not match your expectations. In these cases, you might try using the **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** operators.

For more information, see [Full-Text Search Queries and Collation Settings](/azure/devops/server/install/sql-server/collation-requirements).

## Query indexed fields

In addition to the full-text search index, a query index is created. It is based on those fields that have indexing enabled. The query index improves the response time when you run queries that include indexed fields.

By default, the following fields are indexed: **Assigned To**, **Created Date**, **Changed By**, **State**, **Reason**, **Area ID**, **Iteration ID**, and **Work Item Type**. If there are other fields that your team frequently uses in their queries, you can add them to the query index.

You use the **witadmin indexfield** command to enable or disable indexing for a field. See [Manage work item fields](../../reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md?toc=/azure/devops/reference/toc.json&bc=/azure/devops/reference/breadcrumb/toc.json).
