# Share information within work items and social tools in Azure Boards


[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]
[!INCLUDE [version-vs-gt-eq-2019.md](../../includes/version-vs-gt-eq-2019.md)]

Using work items to track your work provides a host of benefits, including the ability to easily share information. You can capture most information within the work item *Description* or other rich-text formatted fields. If you need to maintain the information in a different format, you can easily link to or attach a file.  

Other ways to share information include using dashboards, README files, and project Wikis. 

Using work items, you can share information in the following ways: 

- Add information to the Description or other rich-text field
- Link to a web site or file, or attach files 
- Link to a storyboard file 

> [!TIP]    
> If you have stakeholders who don't contribute code but want to contribute to the discussion and review progress, make sure you provide them [stakeholder access](../../organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder.md) so that they can view work items and dashboards.  


<a id="rich-text"></a>

## Rich text fields  

To convey detailed information, you can format text and insert images inline within any HTML field type. By default, the following fields are HTML fields and many others not listed here for the CMMI process. 

- *Acceptance Criteria* 
- *Description* 
- *Steps* 
- *System Info*


 You can add custom HTML fields to support your business processes. To learn more about each field, look it up in the [Work item field index](../work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md)

The specific set of formatting features differs depending on the client you use. In all clients, you can bold, italicize, and underline text. You can also add and remove hyperlinks, format text as ordered or unordered lists, and add images. 


#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2020"

The editor toolbar appears below each text box that accepts formatted text. It only becomes active when you move your cursor within the text box.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Rich Text Editor toolbar](media/share-plans/new-rich-text-editor-toolbar.png) 

You can use the :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/rtf-clear.png" border="false"::: clear format icon or **CTRL+Spacebar** to remove formatting from highlighted text.

For the **Discussion** section, the tool bar comes with a few extra icons&mdash;:::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/at-mention.png" border="false"::: at-mention, :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/work-id.png" border="false"::: #-work-item-id, and  :::image type="icon" source="../../media/icons/pr-id.png" border="false"::: pull-request idâ€”to help bring others into the discussion or link to work items or pull requests. Choose one of these icons and a menu displays with the most recent options that you've worked with.

## Link items to work items or objects

To support traceability and add context to work items, you can link items to other work items or objects. From a links control tab, you can choose from various link types to based on the objects you want to link to. 

Your link options will differ depending on the client you use. For specific guidance, see these resources:

- [Add link to work items](../backlogs/add-link.md)  
- [Link items to support traceability and manage dependencies](link-work-items-support-traceability.md)  


<a id="attachments"></a>
<a id="attach-files"></a>

## Attach files to work items

You and your team can centralize reference materials by attaching files to your work items. That way they're always readily accessible when you need them. For example, you can attach a screen image that illustrates a problem, a line of code in a text file, a log, an e-mail thread, or a product feature's specification.

::: moniker range="azure-devops"

You can add up to 100 attachments to a work item. Attachments are limited to 60 MB. Attempts to add more result in an error message upon saving the work item.
::: moniker-end  

::: moniker range="< azure-devops"

You can add up to 100 attachments to a work item. Attachments are limited to 60 MB. 

By default, the size of work item attachments is limited to 4 MB. You can use the TFS web service to [increase the size of files you attach up to 2 GB](../../reference/xml/change-maximum-attachment-size-work-items.md).

::: moniker-end 
 
Choose the ![Attachment tab icon](../backlogs/media/icon-attachments-tab-wi.png) or **Attachments** tab to attach a file with supplemental information. The following file types support preview as attachments.  
- **Image types**: "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "jif", "jfif", "jpx", "fpx", "pcd", "bmp", "img", "eps", "psd", "wmf", "gif"
- **Video Types**: "mp4", "mov", "m4v", "webm

<a id="storyboard" />

## Storyboard your information

Storyboarding your ideas and goals increases visual understanding. With [PowerPoint Storyboarding](/previous-versions/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/office/storyboard-your-ideas-using-powerpoint) you can bring your ideas to life with storyboard shapes, text, animation, and all the other features that PowerPoint provides.  


> [!NOTE]  
> Starting with Visual Studio 2019, the Team Foundation plug-in for Office deprecated support for Storyboarding with PowerPoint. Also, the Visual Studio Gallery for PowerPoint Storyboarding is deprecated. You can still use the Storyboard link type to link to network share objects to share information, however, you can't link from PowerPoint to Azure DevOps using the link feature.


::: moniker range="tfs-2018"
> [!NOTE]  
> Storyboarding with PowerPoint requires [Office PowerPoint 2007 or later](https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/pd/PowerPoint-2010/productID.216564300) and the TFS Storyboarding add-in. You install the TFS Storyboarding add-in for PowerPoint by installing one of the latest editions of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) or [Team Foundation Server Standalone Office Integration](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). 
::: moniker-end 

By linking your storyboard to a work item, you provide your team access to the shared file where they can add their comments. From the ![Links tab icon](../backlogs/media/icon-links-tab-wi.png), **Links**, or a **Storyboards** tab, you can link storyboards that you created using PowerPoint Storyboarding or other application. When you make changes to a linked storyboard, the work item continues to link to the file with the latest changes.

To open PowerPoint with storyboarding, see [Storyboard your ideas using PowerPoint](/previous-versions/azure/devops/boards/backlogs/office/storyboard-your-ideas-using-powerpoint).

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/)


You can open Storyboarding with PowerPoint from the  :::image type="icon" source="../media/icons/actions-icon.png" border="false"::: actions menu within a work item form. 

<img src="media/share-plans-storyboard-vsts-menu.png" alt="Start storyboarding within work item web form, web portal" />  

To link to an existing storyboard, click the ![Links page icon](../media/icons/icon-links-tab-wi.png) Links tab and add a storyboard link.  


#### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)

From the **Storyboards** tab, click **Start Storyboarding** to open Storyboarding with PowerPoint. Or, you can link to an existing storyboard.

<img src="media/share-plans-storyboard-vs-tab.png" alt="Storyboards tab, Visual Studio Team Explorer and Eclipse" />

## Email a work item query list

A common way teams share information is by sharing a list of work items. You can email a formatted list or share a link to a query. 

#### [Browser](#tab/browser/) 

You can quickly generate a formatted list using the **Copy as HTML** or **Copy to clipboard** options. See [Copy list](../backlogs/copy-list.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use the built-in email feature, you can only send the email to individual address for a project member that is recognized by the system. Adding a team group or security group to the to line isn't supported. If you add an email account that the system doesn't recognize, you receive a message that one or more recipients of your email don't have permissions to read the mailed work items.  

#### [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio/)

You can email a formatted query list by choosing the **Send to Microsoft Outlook** option from the context menu.  

:::image type="content" source="media/view-run-queries/send-to-outlook-team-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Team Explorer, choose Send to Microsoft Outlook query option.":::

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires you to have Microsoft Outlook installed. For on-premises Azure DevOps, all email actions require an [SMTP server to be configured](/azure/devops/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts). If you don't have an SMTP server configured, you can work around this by using **Copy as HTML** from the web portal.

## Share data with team dashboards 

You can share progress and status with your team using configurable team dashboards. Dashboards provide easy-to-read, easy access, real-time information. You can add widgets to provide Markdown information, query charts, and more. 

For details, see [Manage dashboards](../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md). 

## Share information with a project wiki 

You can use your project wiki to share information with other team members. Each wiki corresponds to its own git repository and supports collaborative editing of its content and structure.  

To learn more, see [Create a wiki for your project](../../project/wiki/wiki-create-repo.md). 

## Marketplace extensions  

You may find more ways to share information by exporting work items to other applications such as Microsoft Word. To learn more, review the [Marketplace extensions that support Microsoft Word](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=word&target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Boards&sortBy=Relevance).
