# Organize queries, add a query folder    

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Organize your personal or shared queries by adding a query folder. You can then add queries to or move existing queries into those folders. You can create queries and query folders from the web portal or from a supported client, such as Visual Studio Team Explorer and [Team Explorer Everywhere](../../user-guide/work-team-explorer.md#team-explorer-plug-in-for-eclipse), a plug-in for [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

> [!NOTE]  
> To create and manage queries in Visual Studio 2019, you need to [Set the Work Items experience](../work-items/set-work-item-experience-vs.md) to the legacy option.

## Add a query folder, move items into a folder 

::: moniker range=">= azure-devops-2019"

You add query folders from the **Boards>Queries>All** page.
 
1. Choose **All**. Expand **My Queries** or Shared Queries depending on where you want to add a query folder. 
 
1. To add a folder, choose the ![ ](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon for an existing folder or the top container folder, and choose **New folder**. 

	> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
	> ![Open Actions menu, choose New folder](_img/organize-queries/select-new-folder.png)

2. Enter the name for the folder in the New folder dialog. If you want to change the location of the folder, select it from the Folder drop down menu.  

	<img src="_img/organize-queries/new-folder-dialog.png" alt="Open Actions menu, choose New folder" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

3. To move items into a folder, drag-and-drop a query onto the folder. 

	Optionally, you can click the ![Actions icon](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png)  for an existing query, choose **Edit**, and then choose **Save As**. In the Save query as dialog, choose the folder you want to save the query in. 

	<img src="_img/organize-queries/save-query-as-dialog.png" alt="Save query as dialog" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
  
::: moniker-end


::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"

You add query folders from the **Boards>Queries** page.

1. To add a folder, choose the ![ ](../_img/icons/context_menu.png) context menu for an existing folder or the top container folder and select **New query folder**.

## Add a query to the dashboard or share it with your team 

To add a query to the home page or a dashboard, open the ![ ](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) actions icon (or ![ ](_img/22.png) context icon) menu for the query and [add it to a specific dashboard](../../report/dashboards/dashboards.md) or as a team favorite. 

Share queries with your team by adding them to a folder under the **Shared Queries** container.  To save a query to a Shared Queries folder, get added to the [project administrators group](../../organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) or have your [permissions set for a folder under Shared Queries](set-query-permissions.md). 

You can only add shared queries to dashboards or as team favorites, and only if you have [team administrator or project administrator permissions](../../organizations/settings/manage-teams.md).

## Q & A   
<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->

### Q: Can I change the owner of a query or folder?

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="<= tfs-2015"
**A:** Yes. This is a supported feature from the [query Security dialog](set-query-permissions.md). 
::: moniker-end

### Q: Can I add folders to My Favorites or Team Favorites?

**A:** No. You can only add folders under **My Queries** and under **Shared Queries**.

### Q: Are the queries and folders I create from the web portal the same as in Team Explorer?

**A:** Yes. You might have to refresh your browser or client to see changes you make in another client.

### Q: Can I move a query or a folder?  

**A:** Yes. In the web portal, choose **Rename** from the context menu. In Visual Studio Team Explorer, simply drag the folder to the new location.  

In Team Explorer Everywhere (a plugin for Eclipse), choose **Move** from the context menu and select the folder to which you want to move the item.
