# Stop and start services, application pools, and websites

**TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

For Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS) to operate correctly, all required services, application pools, and Web sites must be running on the appropriate server. In single-server deployments, each component must run on the server that runs TFS. In multiple-server deployments, each component must run on the appropriate server. In addition, you might need to stop an element to perform a particular task, such as moving your deployment to a different set of hardware.

For operations such as backing up or restoring databases, you can run the [TFSServiceControl Command](../command-line/tfsservicecontrol-cmd.md) to start or stop all TFS services and application pools.

## To stop or start a service, application pool, or Web site

1.  If you're not a member of the **Administrators** group on the server that hosts the service, application pool, or Web site that you want to manage, get added now. See [Set administrator permissions for Team Foundation Server](../add-administrator-tfs.md).

2.  Log on to the server that hosts the service, application pool, or Web site.

3.  Open **Computer Management**.

4.  In the navigation pane, expand **Services and Applications**.

5.  Perform one of the following steps based on what element you want to stop or start:

    -   For a service, open the navigation menu for the service, and then choose **Stop** or **Start**.

    -   For an application pool, open **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**, expand the local computer and open **Application Pools**. Open the navigation menu and choose **Stop** or **Start**.

    -   For a Web site, open **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**, expand the local computer, and open **Web Sites** or **Sites**. Open the navigation menu and then choose **Stop** or **Start**.

## Location of services, application pools, and web sites

The following table lists the server on which each service, application pool, and web site must be running. The Name column lists the display name for each element with service names in parentheses. Which services you need will vary based on which features of Team Foundation you have installed.
