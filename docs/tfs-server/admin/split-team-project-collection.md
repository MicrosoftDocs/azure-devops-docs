# Split a team project collection

**TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

As your business changes, you might want to split a single team project collection into multiple team project collections. For example:

-   You want the projects in a collection to align with business units in your organization, and the projects in the collection are now owned by separate units.

-   You upgraded from an earlier version of TFS, you have only one collection, and you want to organize your projects into separate collections for security or business alignment reasons.

-   You want to change ownership of some of the projects in the collection to a remote office that has its own deployment of TFS. This scenario requires that you first split a collection and then move one of the resulting collections to the remote office deployment.

	> [!NOTE]
	>The procedures in this topic support only splitting a team project collection. If you want to move a collection after you split it, see [Move a team project collection](move-project-collection.md).

**In this topic**

To split a team project collection, follow these steps:

1.  **Prepare to split the collection:**

    1.  [Detach the collection](#detach-the-coll)

    2.  [Back up the collection database](#backup-coll-db)

2.  **Split the collection:**

    1.  [Restore the collection database with a different Name](#restor-coll-db-new-name)

    2.  [Attach the original collection database](#attach-original-coll-db)

    3.  [Attach the renamed collection database](#attach-renamed-coll-db)

    4.  [Delete projects from the split collections](#delete-projs-split-colls)

    5.  [Start the collections](#start-team-proj-coll)

3.  **Configure the split collections:**

    1.  [Configure Users and Groups for the Split Team Project Collections](#config-users-split-colls)

    2.  [Configure users and groups for projects in the collections](#config-users-projs)

[Q & A](#q-and-a)

**Before you begin**

Make sure that you're an administrator on the servers and in SQL Server and TFS. If you're not an administrator, [get added as one](../add-administrator-tfs.md).

<a name="detach-the-coll"></a>
## 1-a. Detach the collection

First detach the collection from the deployment of TFS on which it is running. Detaching a collection stops all jobs and services as well as the collection database itself. In addition, the detach process copies over the collection-specific data from the configuration database and saves it as part of the team project collection database.

### To detach a team project collection

1.  Open the administration console for Team Foundation on the server that hosts the collection that you want to split.

2.  Choose **Team Project Collections**, and in the list of collections, choose the collection that you want to split.

    In this example, the administrator chooses "TestProjects."

    ![](_img/ic738726.png)

	> [!TIP]
	> The default name for a team project collection is &quot;DefaultCollection.&quot; If you are splitting this database, make sure to give the second collection a distinctly different name, because this is the default choice at connection.

3.  On the **General** tab, choose **Stop Collection**.

    ![](_img/ic738727.png)

    The **Team Project Collection Status Reason** dialog box opens. The text you enter will be displayed to your users. Choose **Stop**, and wait for the collection to stop. When it is stopped, its status will show as **Offline**.

4.  On the **General** tab, choose **Detach Collection**.

    The **Detach Team Project Collection Wizard** opens.

    ![](_img/ic738728.png)

5.  (Optional) On the **Provide a servicing message for the team project collection** page, in **Servicing Message**, provide a message for users who might try to connect to projects in this collection.

6.  On the **Review settings that will be used to detach team project collection** page, review the details. If you want to changes any settings, choose **Previous**. If they appear to be correct, choose **Verify**.

7.  When all the readiness checks have completed successfully, choose **Detach**.

8.  On the **Monitor the team project collection detach progress** page, when all processes have completed, choose **Next**.

9.  (Optional) On the **Review supplemental information for this team project collection** page, choose or note the location of the log file, and then close the wizard.

    The team project collection no longer appears in the list of collections in the administration console.

<a name="backup-coll-db"></a>
## 1-b. Back up the collection database

After you have detached the collection, you must back up its database before you can restore a copy to the server with a different name. That copy will become the database for the part of the original collection that you want to split into another collection. To perform this task, you must use the tools that are provided with SQL Server.

![](_img/ic738721.png)
### To back up a collection database

-   For information about how to manually back up and restore individual databases, see the following pages on the Microsoft Web site, and make sure to choose the version of SQL Server that matches your deployment: [Backing Up and Restoring Databases in SQL Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=115430) and [Create a backup schedule and plan](backup/config-backup-sched-plan.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If your original deployment used the Enterprise or Datacenter editions of SQL Server, and you want to restore the database that you want to split to a server running Standard edition, you must use a backup set that was made with SQL Server compression disabled. Unless you disable data compression, you will not be able to successfully restore Enterprise or Datacenter edition databases to a server running Standard edition. To turn off compression, follow the steps in the [Microsoft Knowledge Base article](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=253758).

<a name="restor-coll-db-new-name"></a>
## 2-a. Restore the collection database

When you split a collection, you must restore the backup of the collection database to an instance of SQL Server that is configured to support the deployment of TFS. When you restore the database, you must give it a different name from the name of the original collection database.

> [!TIP]
> The steps below give a general overview of how to restore a team project collection database in SQL Server 2012 using SQL Server Management Studio. For more information about how to manually back up and restore individual databases, see the following page on the Microsoft Web site, and make sure to choose the version of SQL Server that matches your deployment: [Backing Up and Restoring Databases in SQL Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=115430).

### To restore the collection database with a new name

1.  Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the instance that hosts the database for the team project collection that you want to split.

2.  In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**, open the sub-menu for the database you want to split, and then choose **Tasks**, choose **Restore**, and then choose **Database**.

    The Restore Database window opens on the **General** page.

    ![](_img/ic738729.png)

3.  In **Source**, make sure that the team project collection database is chosen. In **Destination**, provide a name for the copy of the database. Keep the Tfs\_ prefix, but give it a distinct name after that prefix. Ideally that name will be the name of the split team project collection. In **Restore plan**, make sure that the backup sets to restore are the ones you want to restore to. To make sure that these are valid sets, choose **Verify Backup Media** and then, in **Select a page**, choose **Options**.

4.  In **Restore options**, leave all the check boxes blank. Make sure that **Recovery state** is set to **RESTORE WITH RECOVERY**. In **Tail-Log Backup**, clear the **Leave source database in the restoring state** check box, and then choose **OK**.

	>**Tip:**  
	>If the restore operation fails with an error message indicating that the database is in use and cannot be overwritten, you might need to manually configure all the logical file names to reflect the new name for the database. In **Select a page**, choose **Files**, choose the ellipsis button next to each file being restored, and make sure that the names of the files reflect the new name for the database, not the old one. Then try the restore operation again.

<a name="attach-original-coll-db"></a>
## 2-b. Attach the original collection database

After you have restored the database with a different name, you must reattach the original collection database to the deployment of TFS.

> [!NOTE]
> If your deployment uses SharePoint Products and the service account for TFS is not a member of the Farm Administrators group, warnings will appear when you attach the collection. This behavior is expected.


### To attach the collection

1.  Open the administration console for Team Foundation.

2.  Choose **Team Project Collections**, and then choose **Attach Collection**.

    The **Attach Team Project Collection Wizard** opens.

3.  On the **Select the team project collection database to attach** page, in **SQL Server Instance**, provide the name of the server and the instance that hosts the collection database, if it is not already listed.

4.  In the **Databases** list, choose the collection database that you want to attach.

    ![](_img/ic738730.png)

5.  On the **Enter the team project collection information** page, provide a name for the collection in **Name** if one is not already present. Since this is the original collection, you can choose to leave the name the same as it was before. In **Description**, optionally provide a description of the collection.

6.  On the **Review settings that will be used to attach the team project collection** page, review the information.

7.  If you must change any settings, choose **Previous**. If all the settings are correct, choose **Verify**.

8.  When all the readiness checks have completed successfully, choose **Attach**.

9.  On the **Monitor the team project collection attach progress** page, when all processes have completed, choose **Next**.

10. (Optional) On the **Review supplemental information for this team project collection** page, choose or note the location of the log file, and close the wizard.

11. The team project collection appears in the list of collections in the administration console. **If the collection state is listed as** **Online**, **you must stop it before continuing.** Choose the collection from the list, and on the **General** tab, choose **Stop Collection**.

    ![](_img/ic738731.png)

<a name="attach-renamed-coll-db"></a>
## 2-c. Attach the renamed collection database

After you attach the original collection database, you must attach the renamed collection to the deployment of TFS. When this collection is attached, it will remain stopped. You will not be able to start it until all duplicate projects have been removed.

> [!NOTE]
> Warnings will appear when you attach the collection if your deployment uses SharePoint Products and the service account for TFS is not a member of the Farm Administrators group. This behavior is expected.


### To attach the renamed collection database

1.  Open the administration console for Team Foundation.

2.  Choose **Team Project Collections**, and then choose **Attach Collection** to open the wizard.

3.  On the **Select the team project collection database to attach** page, in **SQL Server Instance**, provide the name of the server and the instance that hosts the renamed collection database, if it is not already listed.

4.  In the **Databases** list, choose the renamed collection database.

5.  On the **Enter the team project collection information** page, type a name for the renamed collection in **Name** that differs from the name of the original name of the collection. Ideally, this should match the name you gave the renamed database without the Tfs\_ prefix.

    ![](_img/ic738732.png)

6.  (Optional)In **Description**, type a description of the collection.

7.  On the **Review settings that will be used to attach the team project collection** page, review the information. If you must change any settings, choose **Previous**. If all the settings are correct, choose **Verify**.

8.  When all the readiness checks have completed successfully, choose **Attach**.

9.  On the **Monitor the team project collection attach progress** page, when all processes have completed, choose **Next**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> If the collection is supported by a SharePoint Web application, a warning icon will appear for the attach status of the SharePoint Web application. Similarly, if the original collection included reporting, a warning icon will appear for the attach status for reports. This behavior is expected, and you can ignore it.

10. (Optional) On the **Review supplemental information for this team project collection** page, choose or note the location of the log file, and then close the wizard.

11. The name of the collection appears in the list of collections in the administration console, and its status should display as **Offline**.

    ![](_img/ic738732.png)

12. To ensure that both collections have attached with unique IDs, in the administration console, go to Event Logs and open the log files for both collection attach operations. The GUIDs for CollectionProperties should **not** match.

    ![](_img/ic740323.png)

    In the unlikely event that the CollectionProperties GUIDs do match, you must change the ID to a unique ID before continuing by running the TFSConfig [Collection Command](../command-line/tfsconfig-cmd.md#collection) on the second collection with the /clone parameter..

<a name="delete-projs-split-colls"></a>
## 2-d. Delete projects on the split collections

Now that you have two copies of the collection attached to TFS, you must delete each project from either the original collection or the renamed collection so that no project remains in both collections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A project cannot exist in more than one collection. Until you delete all duplicated projects between the split collections, you will not be able to start the renamed collection.

### To delete projects from the collections

1.  Open the administration console for Team Foundation.

2.  Choose **Team Project Collections**, and in the list of collections, choose the original team project collection that you stopped in order to split it.

3.  On the **Team Projects** tab, in the list of team projects, choose a project that you want to delete from the collection, and then choose **Delete**.

	> [!TIP]
	> You can select more than one project to delete at a time.

    ![](_img/ic738734.png)

4.  Select the **Delete workspace data** check box, leave the **Delete external artifacts** check box cleared, and then choose **Delete**.

    If the **Delete external artifacts** check box is not cleared and your team project is configured to use Lab Management, the virtual machines and templates that are associated with the project will be deleted from System Center Virtual Machine Manager. They will no longer be available to the team project in the renamed collection.

5.  When you have finished deleting the projects you do not want hosted in the original team project collection, choose the renamed team project collection from the list of collections. Then, on the Team Projects tab, delete the projects you do not want hosted on the new collection.

    ![](_img/ic738735.png)

6.  Repeat these steps until both collections contain a set of unique projects.

<a name="start-team-proj-coll"></a>
## 2-e. Start the team project collections

After you delete projects, you must restart both collections.

### To start a team project collection

1.  Open the administration console for Team Foundation.

2.  Choose **Team Project Collections**, and in the list of collections, choose the collection that you stopped in order to split it.

3.  On the **General** tab, choose **Start Collection**.

4.  Repeat step 2 for the collection that you attached with a new name.

    ![](_img/ic738736.png)

<a name="config-users-split-colls"></a>
## 3-a. Configure users and groups for the split collections

You can skip this procedure if both split collections will remain in the same domain and you want to allow access for the administrators of the original collection to both collections.

After you have split a collection, you must update the permission groups for both collections with users and groups that will administer those collections.

### To configure administrators for both collections

-   For more information, see [Set administrator permissions for team project collections](../add-administrator-tfs.md).

<a name="config-users-projs"></a>
## 3-b. Configure users and groups for projects

You can skip this procedure if the split collections will remain in the same domain and you want to allow access for the users of projects in the original collection to both collections.

After you configure administrators for both collections, either you or those administrators must configure access for users and groups to the projects in each collection. Depending on your deployment, you might also need to configure permissions for those users in SharePoint Products and Reporting Services.

### To configure access for users to team projects

-   For more information, see [Add users to team projects or teams](../../security/add-users-team-project.md).

<a name="q-and-a"></a>
## Q & A

### Q: My deployment uses reporting. Are there any additional steps I need to take when splitting collections?

**A:** Yes, you'll need to split reports after you've finished deleting team projects so that both collections have a unique set of projects. You'll also need to rebuild your data warehouse.

After you delete projects, you must move the reports that the split collection uses into a different folder, and you must delete them from the original folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The report folders exist in both locations. Make sure that you move all reports appropriately before you delete any report folders.

### To split reports into separate folders

1.  In Report Manager, move the reports that support the split collection into the appropriate folders for that collection.

    For more information, see the following topic on the Microsoft Web site: [Move Items Page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=178734).

2.  If your deployment utilizes a SharePoint Web application, you might need to repair the connection again after you move the reports before they will appear correctly. If reports do not appear correctly, follow the steps in the previous procedure to repair the connection.

Once you've split the reports and started both collections, you must rebuild the warehouse for Team Foundation and the database for Analysis Services. You must perform this step to ensure that reports and dashboards work correctly for the deployment after you split the collection and that no conflicts occur with other collections in the deployment.

### To rebuild the data warehouse and the Analysis Services database

1.  Open the administration console for Team Foundation.

2.  In the navigation bar, choose **Reporting**.

3.  In **Reporting**, choose **Start Rebuild**.

4.  In the **Rebuild the Warehouse and Analysis Services Databases** dialog box, choose **OK**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The warehouses will continue to be rebuilt and the data will continue to be repopulated after the Start Rebuild action finishes. Depending on the size of your deployment and the amount of data, the whole process might take several hours to complete.

### Q: Can I split a collection that uses SharePoint Products to support one or more team projects in the collection?

**A:** Yes, but you'll need to perform additional steps for the split collection.

After you attach the renamed collection and remove all duplicate projects, you must repair the connection to the SharePoint Web application. Repairing the connection ensures that all connections are correctly set between the Web application and the original and renamed collections.

If your deployment uses SharePoint Products, it is strongly recommended that the service account for TFS be a member of the **Farm Administrators** group.

> [!NOTE]
> You can split a team project collection without granting this membership to the service account for TFS. However, you will see errors when you attach the collection, and you will need to perform additional steps to reconnect projects with their portals. Even if your operational requirements generally restrict granting this membership to the service account, you should consider adding the service account to the Farm Administrators group for the duration of the split operation.


### To repair the connection to a SharePoint Web application

1.  Open the administration console for Team Foundation on the server that hosts the application tier for the deployment to which you want to move the collection.

2.  Choose **SharePoint Web Applications**, and in the list of Web applications, choose the Web application that supports the collections that you just attached.

    The **Repair Connection** button appears after you select a Web application in the list.

3.  Choose **Repair Connection**, and in the **Repair the connection to a SharePoint Web Application** dialog box, choose **Repair**.

4.  When the Status window reports **Reconnect operation succeeded**, choose **Close**. This might take a few minutes. In addition, you might see some errors as part of this process, since the two collections are still using the same SharePoint default site location for their team project portals. This is expected behavior.

After you have repaired the connection and started both collections, you must reconfigure the team project portals for projects in each collection so that those portals reflect the correct data for those projects.

<a name="configportals"></a>
### To reconfigure team project portals

-   Open Team Explorer, connect to each team project collection, and for each team project, configure the URL for the SharePoint site. For each team project, choose **Settings**, choose **Portal Settings**, and make sure that the **Reports and dashboards refer to data for this team project** check box is selected.

You can continue to use the same site collection in SharePoint Products to support both split collections. Team projects in both collections will use the same team project portals as before. All portals are hosted on the site collection that supported the original team project collection. However, this configuration not only complicates the one-to-one relationship between a team project collection and a site collection but also makes restoring your deployment potentially more difficult. To avoid this complexity, you can split the site collection that supported the original team project collection to reflect the split that you made for the team project collections.

### To split the site collection and redirect the split team project collections to use the split site collections

1.  For information about how to split a site collection, see [Move site collections between databases](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc825328(v=office.15).aspx) or the latest guidance for your version of SharePoint Products.

	> [!TIP]
	> Make sure that you configure user permissions and access to the site collections to match the user access to the team project collections, as detailed earlier in this topic.

2.  Configure any affected team project collection to utilize the split site collection by opening the administration console, choosing the collection from the list of the team project collections, and on the SharePoint Site tab, choosing **Edit Default Site Location**.

3.  Reconfigure the team project portals for team projects in each collection so that those portals reflect the correct data for those projects.

    For more information, see [Reconfigure Team Project Portals](split-team-project-collection.md#configportals) above.



### Q: How do I split a collection configured for Lab Management?

**A:** You'll need to perform several additional steps to split the collection. Before you start the split, you'll need to delete the Lab Management resources from the collection, and then, after the split, you'll have to individually configure Lab Management resources for each of the split collections.

Before you start the split, delete the resources that Lab Management uses from the collection database. These resources include virtual machines, templates, team project host groups, and team project library shares. You will need to re-create the Lab Management assets after you restore and attach the collection.

### To delete the Lab Management resources

-   For information about how to remove all group hosts, library shares, and environments from a specified team project collection, see [TFSConfig Lab /Delete Command](../command-line/tfsconfig-cmd.md#lab-delete) with the **/External** option.

Once you've completed the split, you must recreate team project host groups. You must also recreate team project library shares in TFS and the virtual machines, templates, and environments in Microsoft Test Manager.

### To configure Lab Management resources

1.  Configure the application tier for Team Foundation.

    For more information, see [Configuring Lab Management for SCVMM Environments](config-lab-scvmm-envs.md).

2.  Recreate the golden master virtual machines and templates in the new SCVMM and import virtual machines and templates into the team project collection.

    For more information, see [How to: Create and Store Virtual Machines and Templates Ready for Lab Management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee702479(v=vs.120).aspx).

3.  Recreate the environments for each team project.

    For more information, see [Creating an SCVMM Environment Using Stored Virtual Machines and Templates](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee518915(v=vs.120).aspx).
