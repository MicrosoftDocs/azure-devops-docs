# Configure the Enterprise Editions of SharePoint Server 2010 or Office SharePoint Server 2007 for Dashboard Compatibility with Team Foundation Server

**TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

Before you can use the Enterprise edition of either Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007 or Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, you must
configure it to work with your deployment of Team Foundation Server. If
you do not configure the settings that this topic describes, the
reports and dashboards in team project portals might not have all the
functionality that you expect or might not function correctly.

**Required Permissions**

To perform this procedure, you must be a member of the 
**Administrators** security group on the server that is
running Team Foundation Server. You must also be a member of the Farm
Administrators group in SharePoint Products.

## Configure SharePoint Server 2010

To manually configure the Enterprise edition of SharePoint Server 2010
for compatibility with Team Foundation Server, you must perform the
procedures in this section.

### Configure required services in SharePoint Server 2010

Team Foundation Server requires certain services to run in SharePoint
Server 2010 for reports and dashboards to appear correctly in team
project portals.

To configure services in SharePoint Server 2010:

  1.  On the server that is running SharePoint Server 2010, open
      SharePoint Central Administration, and then choose 
      **Configuration Wizards**.

  2.  Choose **Start the Wizard**.

  3.  Make sure that the **Excel Services
      Application** and **Secure Store
      Service** check boxes have been selected, and then choose 
      **Next**.

### Configure Excel services

For reports to operate correctly, you must also configure the web
application that you created for Team Foundation Server to use a trusted
file location for Excel Services.

To add a trusted file location:

  1.  In SharePoint Central Administration, under 
      **Application Management**, choose 
      **Manage service applications**.

  2.  On the Manage Service Applications page, choose 
      **Excel Services Application**.

  3.  On the Manage Excel Services Application page, choose 
      **Trusted File Locations**.

  4.  Choose **Add Trusted File Location**.

  5.  In **Address**, enter the URL of the root
      site of the web application that you will use with Team
      Foundation Server.

      You should specify the web application that you created for Team
      Foundation Server.

  6.  In **Location Type**, choose 
      **Microsoft SharePoint Foundation**.

  7.  In **Trust Children**, select the 
      **Children trusted** check box.

  8.  In the **External Data** section, under 
      **Allow External Data**, choose 
      **Trusted data connection libraries and embedded**.

  9.  (Optional) Clear the **Refresh warning
      enabled** check box.

  10. In **Maximum Concurrent Queries Per
      Session**, change the number to 20, and then choose 
      **OK**.

### Configure secure store service (optional)

In SharePoint Server 2010, the secure store service replaces the single
sign-on service in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. To configure
the secure store service, you must create a target application for the
secure store. In Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, this
application was called an enterprise application definition.

To configure the secure store service:

  1.  In SharePoint Central Administration, under 
      **Application Management**, choose 
      **Manage service applications**.

  2.  On the Manage Service Applications page, choose 
      **Secure Store Service**.

  3.  Choose **New** to create a secure store
      target application for Team Foundation Server.

      > [!TIP]
      > If you have not created a key, SharePoint Products prompts you to create
      > one by choosing **Generate New Key**. Without a
      > key, you cannot create a target application for the secure store.

  4.  On the Create New Secure Store Target Application page, in 
      **Target Application ID** and 
      **Display Name**, enter 
      ```TFS```.

      > [!TIP]
      > You do not have to use ```TFS``` for
      > **Target Application ID** or
      > **Display Name**, but take note of whatever you use
      > here, because you will need it to configure Team Foundation
      > Server later.
      
  5.  In **Contact E-mail**, enter the e-mail
      address of the person or group you want email messages about this
      application to be sent to.

  6.  In the **Target Application Type** list,
      choose **Group**.

  7.  In **Target Application Page URL**, choose
      **None**, and then choose 
      **Next**.

  8.  In **Specify the credential fields for your Secure
      Store Target Application**, choose 
      **Next** to accept the default settings for the
      credential fields.

  9.  In **Specify the membership settings**, enter
      the administrative account for the application in 
      **Target Application Administrators**.

  10. In **Members**, enter the global security
      group from the domain that contains all the users to whom you want
      to grant access to dashboards and reports in Team Foundation Server,
      and then choose **OK**.

  11. On the Secure Store Service Application page, select the check box
      for the target application that you just created (named TFS if you
      used the naming guidance that was provided earlier in this topic),
      and then choose **Set Credentials** in
      the ribbon.

  12. In the **Set Credentials for Secure Store Target
      Application (Group)** dialog box, enter the name and password,
      confirm the password of the report reader account for Team
      Foundation Server, and then choose **OK**.

      > [!TIP]
      > TFSReports is the placeholder name of the report reader account.


## Configure Office SharePoint Server 2007

To manually configure the Enterprise edition of Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server 2007 for compatibility with Team Foundation Server,
you must perform the procedures in this section.

### Configure required services in Office SharePoint Server 2007

Team Foundation Server requires certain services to run in Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007 for reports and dashboards to appear

      > the Microsoft website: [Service Accounts and Dependencies in Team Foundation Server](service-accounts-dependencies-tfs.md).


### Create a shared service provider for use with Team Foundation Server

After you enable the services that Team Foundation Server requires, you
must create a shared service provider (SSP) for use with Team Foundation
Server. You will also create a SharePoint web application to support
this SSP.

To create a shared service provider and the web application that it will use:

1.  Choose **Home** to display the main page for
    Central Administration, and then choose **Shared
    Services Administration**.

2.  On the **Manage this Farm's Shared Services**
    page, choose **New SSP**.

    The **New Shared Services Provider**
    page appears.

3.  In **SSP Name**, either enter a name for the
    new SSP, or accept the default name.

    By default, the name is **SharedServices**
    followed immediately by a number (for example, **SharedServices1**).

4.  Choose **Create a new Web application**.

    The **Create New Web Application**
    page appears.

5.  In **IIS Web site**, choose 
    **Create a new IIS Web site**.

6.  (Optional) In **Description**, change the
    value from the default value, **SharePoint**,
    to the name that you provided in the previous step (for
    example, SharedServices1).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Do not change the port number or remove the port number reference from
    > the description.

7.  In **Security Configuration**, choose 
    **NTLM**, and then choose 
    **Create a new application pool**.

8.  In **Application Pool**, configure the
    following options:

      -   In **Application pool name**, ensure that
          the name matches the name in 
          **Description**.

      -   In the **Select a security account for this
          application pool** section, choose 
          **Configurable**, and then enter the user name
          and password of the service account for SharePoint Products.

9.  Leave the rest of the settings in their default configurations, and
    then choose **OK**.

    After the web application is created, the **New
    Shared Services Provider** page appears with an error message
    in the title bar. This behavior is expected.

10. In **SSP Name**, in **Web
    Application**, verify that the name of the web application that
    you just created for the SSP appears, and do not modify the values
    of any settings in this section.

11. In **My Site Location**, under 
    **My Site Location URL**, in 
    **Relative URL**, enter a relative URL if a site
    already exists at /.

    This URL is required only if a site already exists at 
    **/**. Users typically specify **/My**, but you can
    specify any name that does not use prohibited characters. For more
    information, see the following page on the Microsoft website:
    [Naming Restrictions in Team Foundation](../../collaborate/naming-restrictions.md).

12. In **Enter the SSP Service Credentials**,
    enter the user name and password of a domain account that you want
    to use as the account for the service credentials.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must specify a domain user account, but it doesn't have to be a
    > member of any particular security group. Specify a unique user account
    > that doesn't have administrative permissions. Do not use the service
    > account for Team Foundation (TFSService) or the data reader
    > account (TFSReports) because they both require permissions that this
    > account should not have. For more information, see the following page on
    > the Microsoft website: [Service Accounts and Dependencies in Team Foundation Server](service-accounts-dependencies-tfs.md).

13. Leave the rest of the settings in their default configurations,
    choose **OK**, and then wait for the
    operation to complete.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If a warning message appears about hosting the administration site for
    > SSP and the root site on the same server, choose <span
    > **OK**.

14. On the **Success** page, choose **OK**.


### Configure single sign-on

To configure single sign-on, you must create an enterprise application
definition. During the following procedure, you might need to log on
with two sets of credentials. To successfully complete this procedure,
the account with which you log on to the server that is running
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 must be:

-   A domain user account, not a group account.

-   A member of the **Farm
    Administrators** group.

-   A member of the local Administrators group on the
    encryption-key server.

-   A member of the **securityadmin** and 
    **db\_creator** roles on the instance of SQL Server
    that will host the single sign-on database.

-   Either the same account that is used as the 
    **Single Sign-On Administrator Account** or a
    member of the group account that is used as the 
    **Single Sign-On Administrator Account**.

To configure single sign-on: 

  1.  In SharePoint Central Administration, choose the 
      **Operations** tab.

  2.  Under **Security Configuration**, choose
      **Service accounts**.

      component** section, choose 
      **Configurable**.

  5.  Enter the user name and password of an account that you have
      configured to use as the sign-on account, and then choose 
      **OK**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The service account that you specify requires special permissions and
      > has security implications. The account must have the permissions that
      > are required to log on interactively on this server and must be a member
      > of the Administrators group on the single sign-on server. For this
      > account, you should not specify the service account that you use for
      > SharePoint Products or a system account, such as Network Services. For
      > more information, see the following pages on the Microsoft website:

      **Refresh warning enabled** check box is cleared,
      and then choose **OK**.


### Set the access model

After you configure all the settings and services that Team Foundation
Server requires, you must configure the access model for the web
application for single sign-on for delegation. If you do not configure
the access model, Team Foundation Server and the web application cannot
interoperate.

To set the access model:

  1.  On the server that is running SharePoint Central Administration,
      open a Command Prompt window.

  2.  Change directories to %programfiles%\\Common Files\\Microsoft
      Shared\\Web Server Extensions\\12\\bin, and enter the following
      command:

      **stsadm -o set-ecssecurity -ssp** *SharedServiceProviderName* **-accessmodel delegation**

      *SharedServiceWebApplicationName* is the name of the shared service provider that you created. If you
      followed the suggested naming convention, this name of that provider
      is **SharedServices1**.

  3.  At the command prompt, enter ```iisreset``` to
      restart IIS.
