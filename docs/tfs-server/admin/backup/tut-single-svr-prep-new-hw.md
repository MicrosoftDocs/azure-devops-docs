## Choose hardware and name the server

Restoring a deployment that has unexpectedly gone offline due to a hardware failure is always stressful, and usually involves acquiring hardware as quickly as possible. You might be tempted to grab an unused machine and try to use it as the new server. However, for the long-term health of your deployment and to help ensure a successful restoration of your deployment, you should not use any server that has less RAM than the previous machine, and you should make sure that the new server is running the same operating system as the old server. You also must match the service pack level of the previous server as closely as possible.

In addition, this can be an opportune time to expand the hard drive space or processing power for your deployment, particularly if your previous server was not performing as quickly as you wanted, or if you were running low on hard drive space. Upgrading the numbers or speed of the processors, adding more RAM, or adding more hard drive space should not adversely affect your restoration, and you and your users can benefit from a faster, more powerful server.

## Name the server

Your users will experience the least amount of confusion and inconvenience if you give the new server the exact same name as the old one. You will also find it much easier to restore the deployment if the new server has the same name as the old server. Unless you have compelling reasons not to reuse the name, such as underscores in the old server name that interfered with navigation in Team Web Access, use the same name for the new server as the old server.

## Install SQL Server on the new server

After you acquire a server that meets the requirements mentioned above and give it the same name, you must install the same version and edition of SQL Server on that new hardware. You must also make sure to choose the same collation settings as your previous deployment, or you will not be able to restore the databases you backed up for the old deployment.

>**Tip:**  
>Most installations of SQL Server use the default collation settings. The default collation settings are determined by the Windows system locale on the server where you install SQL Server.

    ![Accounts set to Network Service/Automatic](../_img/ic562055.png)

14. On the **Database Engine Services** page, on the **Account Provisioning** tab, choose **Windows authentication mode** and then choose **Add Current User** to add your account as an administrator for this instance of SQL Server. Optionally add any other user accounts for users you want to act as database administrators, and then choose **Next**.

15. On the **Analysis Services Configuration** page, on the **Account Provisioning** tab, choose **Add Current User** to add your account as an administrator for the analysis services database. Optionally add any other user accounts for users you want to act as administrators, and then choose **Next**.

16. On the **Reporting Services Configuration** page, choose **Install the native mode default configuration**, and then choose **Next**.

17. On the **Error Reporting** page, choose whether to send information about errors to Microsoft, and then choose **Next**.

18. On the **Installation Rules** page, review any failures or warnings, and then choose **Next**.

19. On the **Ready to Install** page, review the list of components to be installed, and if they match the list of features shown in the illustration below, then choose **Install**. If you need to make any changes, choose **Back**.

    ![Install SQL Server 2008 R2 - Ready](../_img/ic562056.png)

    On the **Installation Progress** page, optionally monitor the installation progress of each component. When all components have finished installing, the **Complete** page appears. Review any messages, and then close the page.

20. After you finish the installation, visit Microsoft Update to apply the same service packs or updates that you applied to the installation on the old server. Do not apply any service packs or updates that were not applied to that server.

## Installing SharePoint Foundation on the new server

Unlike a new installation of Team Foundation Server, you cannot use the installation wizard for TFS to install SharePoint Foundation for you. If you want to be able to restore the team project portals and other information used in the SharePoint Foundation portion of your deployment, you must first install SharePoint Foundation manually, and then restore the farm.

## Use SharePoint Tools to install SharePoint Foundation

You can use the tools and features provided with SharePoint Foundation to install it on the new server. You should choose the same deployment configuration as your previous deployment. For example, if you installed SharePoint Foundation automatically during the installation process for Team Foundation Server in your original deployment, you should choose to install SharePoint Foundation on a single server, but using the installation of SQL Server you have already installed on the new server. You should also run the Microsoft SharePoint Products Preparation Tool prior to installing SharePoint Foundation.

### To install SharePoint Foundation in a single-server farm configuration

1.  Launch the installation media for SharePoint Foundation. On the SharePoint Foundation Start page, choose **Install SharePoint Foundation**.

2.  On the **Read the Microsoft Software License Terms** page, review the terms, select the **I accept the terms of this agreement** check box, and then choose **Continue**.

3.  On the **Choose the installation you want** page, choose **Server farm**.

4.  On the **Server Type** tab, choose **Complete**.

    If you want to install SharePoint Foundation in a custom location, choose the **Data Location** tab, and then either type the location or choose **Browse** to specify the location.

5.  Choose **Install Now**.

6.  When setup completes, choose **Close**. Do not configure the initial farm.

## Use Windows PowerShell to install SharePoint Foundation

While there are a number of ways to install SharePoint Foundation, including the tools provided with SharePoint Foundation, restoring the farm requires Windows PowerShell. You can also use Windows PowerShell to install SharePoint Foundation. For convenience, consider using Windows PowerShell for both installing and restoring SharePoint Foundation on the new server. For more information about Windows PowerShell, see [Getting Started: Windows Server Administration with Windows PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=236005).

### To install SharePoint Foundation using Windows PowerShell

1.  Open a Windows PowerShell command prompt.

2.  Input the following command, where *Drive* is the location of the installation media for SharePoint Foundation:
all-SharePoint -SetupExePath "Drive:\SharePoint 2013\Setup\setup.exe"

    This installs SharePoint Foundation using a PID key in a farm deployment, but does not configure it or create any databases. Instead, you will restore the farm and its databases to this installation.

    >**Tip:**  
    >As an alternative, you can choose to use a configuration XML file with the Install-SharePoint command to install SharePoint Foundation.

    For more information, see [Install SharePoint Foundation by using Windows PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=236008).

## Install Team Foundation Server

To restore the databases using the **Scheduled Backups** features, you must install, but not configure, the Team Foundation Server software.

To install Team Foundation Server binaries and tools:

1.  Launch the installation media for Team Foundation Server. On the **Team Foundation Server Setup** page, choose **Install**.

2.  When the installation completes, the **Team Foundation Server Configuration Center** opens. Choose **Cancel**.

    ![Close the configuration center when it appears](../_img/ic654274.png)

    The administration console opens automatically in an unconfigured state. This is expected.
