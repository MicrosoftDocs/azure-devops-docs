# Configure Lab Management for SCVMM environments and Team Foundation Server

**TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

To create and manage System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
environments, you must first configure the required components for Lab
Management. These components are:

-   Hyper-V hosts

-   SCVMM

-   Team Foundation Server

-   A test controller

For more information about Lab Management, see [Using a Lab
Environment for Your Application
Lifecycle](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997438(v=vs.120).aspx).

If you are upgrading from earlier versions of Lab Management or SCVMM,
see [upgrading](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh707966(v=vs.120).aspx).

> [!NOTE]
> Any computers that you use as Library Servers (including the SCVMM
> machine that has a default library server) and as Hyper-V hosts should
> be on a gigabit network that is connected to a common network switch.
> The faster network speed will help improve performance when you deploy
> virtual machines to hosts and when you save virtual machines to the
> library from your host.


## Prerequisites

The Team Foundation Server administrator must set up and configure Team
Foundation Server before configuring Lab Management. For more
information about how to set up and configure Team Foundation Server,
see the Team Foundation Server Installation Guide. After the
administrator has configured Team Foundation Server and created a
default team project collection, make sure that you have the following
information:

-   *TfsMachine*: The name of the machine
    that is running Team Foundation Server.

-   *domain*: The Active Directory domain
    that is used by all machines.

-   *tfssvc*: The account under which Team
    Foundation Server is running.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must use a domain user account and password for the TFSservice
    > account to set up an SCVMM environment for lab management.

-   *domain*\\*tfsadmin*: The account for the Team
    Foundation Server administrator.

## Set up and configure Hyper-V hosts

To set up Hyper-V, you can do one of the following:

-   Enable the Hyper-V role on your computer that has Windows Server
    2008 R2 or Windows Server 2012 installed. If you do not have the
    Hyper-V role enabled on the *HyperVHost* computer, you must first enable
    this by using Server Manager on each of the Hyper-V hosts so that
    you can create and manage virtual machines using the steps in the
    following procedure. For more information about Hyper V, see the
    following [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179531).

-   Install Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 on your 
    *HyperVHost*. For information about Hyper-V
    server and how to install it, see the following [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=181875).

To enable the Hyper-V role on each Hyper-V host with Windows Server: 

  1.  On the Hyper-V host, log on as an administrator.

  2.  Choose **Start**, point to 
      **Administrative Tools**, and then choose 
      **Server Manager**.

  3.  In the left pane of **Server Manager,**
      right-choose **Roles** and point to 
      **Add Roles**.

  4.  Follow the **Add Roles Wizard**. You can just
      choose **Next** in all except the following
      pages of the wizard:

      1.  On the **Select Server Roles** page,
          select **Hyper-V** and then choose 
          **Next**.

      2.  On the **Create Virtual Networks** page,
          you must select an active network adapter and then choose 
          **Next**.

          > [!NOTE]
          > To find which network adapters are active, use the **ipconfig** command
          > to view which network adapters have IP addresses. In the wizard, select
          > the network adapter that should be used for creating a virtual network.
          > You must select an adapter that is connected to the same network as the
          > other machines in the lab. If there are several adapters, select the
          > adapter to which the virtual machines that were created by Lab
          > Management should be connected.

      3.  On the **Confirm Installation
          Selections** page, choose 
          **Install**.

      4.  On the **Installation Results** page,
          choose **Close**.

      5.  On the **Do you want to restart now**
          dialog box, choose **Yes**.

          The machine will restart and continue with 
          **Resume Configuration Wizard**.

      6.  On the **Installation Results** page, you
          will see a message that states **Installation succeeded**.
          Choose **Close**.

  5.  Install the update described on this [Microsoft Web
      site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186068). This update
      supports the network isolation capability of SCVMM environments.


### Improve the reliability of WinRM

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is used by SCVMM to communicate with
Hyper-V hosts. You must make the following changes to the default
configuration settings for WinRM. The changes to these settings help
improve the reliability of WinRM because Lab Management performs a
larger number of operations on Hyper-V hosts than are performed in a
typical production scenario for Hyper-V. These changes to the WinRM
settings must also be performed on any computer that is used for a
library share.

To change Windows Remote Management configuration settings:

  1.  Choose **Start**, open the shortcut menu for
      the **Command Prompt**, and then choose 
      **Run as administrator**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You must be a domain user who has been added to the administrators group
      > for this machine.

  2.  At the command prompt, run the following command:

      ```winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms = "1800000"}```

  3.  Restart the winrm service and the SCVMM agent on the host using the
      following commands:

      ```net stop winrm```

      ```net start winrm```

      ```net start scvmmagent```

  4.  If the host OS is Windows Server 2008: 

      1.  Run the following command:

          ```winrm set winrm/config/Service @{MaxConcurrentOperations="200"}```

      2.  Restart winrm and the SCVMM agent on the host using the
          following commands:

          ```net stop winrm```

          ```net start winrm```

          ```net start scvmmagent```


### Verify the Hyper-V setup

To verify that Hyper-V is installed correctly and is working:


-   Create a virtual machine using Hyper-V and check that you can start
    the virtual machine.

    If you have enabled the Hyper-V role for your 
    *HyperVHost*, create a virtual machine using
    the information from the following
    [Microsoft](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=179170) Web site.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can change the settings for the virtual machine based on your needs.
    > You can update the hard disk size and the memory. For more information
    > about these settings, see the following [Microsoft Web
    > site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179170).

    If you are using Hyper-V Server, create a virtual machine using the
    information in the Hyper-V Server Getting Started Guide from the
    following
    [Microsoft](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=181894) Web site.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have multiple hard disk drives on your Hyper-V machine, you must
    > configure the paths for the virtual machines to be the larger disk, or
    > you may not have sufficient disk space to create your virtual machines.

For more information about Hyper-V, see [this overview of Hyper-V](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=164925).

> [!NOTE]
> When you create or start a virtual machine, issues may occur due to
> antivirus software. For more information, see the following [Microsoft
> Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=180418).

## Install and configure SCVMM

To access the virtual machines that you create with Hyper-V from Lab
Management, you must install and configure SCVMM. SCVMM is a tool for
managing your Hyper-V host machines from a central console. Lab
Management communicates with SCVMM to be able to use the virtual
machines and templates to create environments. Two versions of System
Center Virtual Machine Manager are supported for Lab Management: SCVMM
2012 or SCVMM 2008 R2. Lab Management **does not** support SCVMM 2016. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the stand-alone Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 operating
> system, you must install SCVMM on a separate 
> *VmmMachine*. You cannot use the 
> *HyperVHost* computer. For more information about
> the unique characteristics of Hyper-V Server 2008 R2, see the following
> [Microsoft Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=181875)

          **Specify Windows Server computers by names**,
          in the **Computer names** box, type the
          computer name of the host that you are adding to SCVMM (for
          example, *HyperVHost*), and then
          choose **Next**.

      3.  On the **Select the computer that you want to
          add as hosts** page, select the Hyper-V host computers and
          choose **Next**.

      4.  On the **Summary** wizard page, choose
          **Finish**.

          > [!NOTE]
          > It is recommended that you configure a separate host group for each team
          > project collection. For example, if you plan to configure Lab Management
          > in two project collections in Team Foundation Server, you can create two
          > host groups in System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

  3.  (Optional) By default, SCVMM configures the machine on which it is
      installed to act as a library server. It also sets up a default
      library share on the machine. You can add more library servers or
      shares to improve the performance.

      1.  To add a new library server to SCVMM, choose 
          **Library**, and then choose the 
          **Add library server** button from the ribbon
          and follow the instructions in the wizard.

      2.  To add a new library share to SCVMM, first create a Windows file
          share on a library server. Then choose 
          **Library**, in the navigation pane, select the
          library server where you created the Windows file share, and
          choose **Library Server** from the menu.
          In the ribbon, choose **Add library
          shares** and follow the instruction in the wizard.

          > project collection.

  4.  To ensure that virtual machines start quickly and that the host
      service and any network agents do not timeout, set the minimum
      amount of memory that the *HyperVHost*
      machine will always have in reserve. The default memory reserves on
      the host machine are often too low to accommodate the longer startup
      time required for virtual machines.

      1.  In the SCVMM Administrator Console, choose 
          **Fabric**.

      2.  In the navigation pane, expand 
          **Servers**, **All
          Hosts**, choose the Hyper-V host machine, and then choose
          the **Properties** button from
          the ribbon.

      3.  In the properties dialog box, choose 
          **Reserves** and then select the 
          **Override host reserves settings from the parent
          host group** check box.

      4.  In the **Memory (MB)** edit box, type or
          select ```1024```, and then choose 
          **OK**.

  3.  (Optional) By default, SCVMM configures the machine on which it is
      installed to act as a library server. It also sets up a default
      library share on the machine. You can add more library servers or
      shares to improve the performance.

      1.  To add a new library server to SCVMM, choose 
          **Add library server** in the 
          **Actions** pane on the right side and follow
          the instructions in the wizard.

      2.  To add a new library share to SCVMM, first create a Windows file
          share on a library server. Then select the library server on the
          **Library** tab of SCVMM Administrator
          Console and choose **Add library shares**
          under the **Actions** pane on the
          right side.

          > [!NOTE]
          > We recommend that you configure a separate library share for each team
          > project collection.

      3.  On each SCVMM library server, install the update described on
          this [Microsoft
          website](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=186068). This
          update supports the network isolation capability of
          SCVMM environments.

  4.  To ensure that virtual machines start quickly and that the host
      service and any network agents do not timeout, set the minimum
      amount of memory that the *HyperVHost**
      machine will always have in reserve. The default memory reserves on
      the host machine are often too low to accommodate the longer startup
      time required for virtual machines.

      1.  In the SCVMM Administrator Console, choose 
          **Go**, **Hosts**.

      2.  In the center **All Hosts** pane, open
          the shortcut menu for the name of the host machine, and then
          choose **Properties**.

      3.  In the **Host Group Properties for **
          *host machine* dialog, choose the
          **Reserves** tab.

      4.  In the **Memory** edit box, enter or
          select ```1024```, and then choose 
          **OK**. For more information about the minimum
          required memory for Hyper-V hosts, see this [Microsoft
          website](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=181896).

      5.  Repeat steps b through d for each host.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have two SCVMM servers that are both configured to be used by Lab
> Management with a specific Team Foundation Server, then each SCVMM
> server must be configured to use a unique MAC range. To configure the
> MAC range, from the Virtual Machine Manager Administration Console, in
> the lower-left navigation window choose 
> **Administration**, choose 
> **Networking** and then open **Global
> Static MAC Address Range**. For more information about how to
> configure the MAC range, see the following [Microsoft Web
> site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=182078).

To verify that SCVMM is installed correctly and is working:

  1.  In the **Virtual Machine Manager Administrator
      Console**, in the **Actions** pane on
      the right side, choose **New virtual
      machine**. Choose **Next** in all except
      the following pages of the wizard.

      1.  On the **Select Source** wizard page,
          select **Create the new virtual machine with a
          blank virtual hard disk**.

      2.  On the **Virtual Machine Identity**
          wizard page, in **Virtual machine name**,
          enter ```blank```.

      3.  On the **Select Destination** wizard
          page, select **Place the virtual machine on a
          host**.

      4.  On the **Select Host** wizard page, view
          the ratings, and then choose **Next**.

          You should see all the *HyperVHost*
          machines that you are using for Lab Management. All of them
          should have positive star ratings. If not, you might have an
          issue that must be corrected. To determine why the 
          *HyperVHost* machines are not usable by
          SCVMM, examine the **Rating
          Explanation**.

      5.  On the **Summary** wizard page, choose
          **Create**.

          A new virtual machine called **blank**
          should be created without any errors and should be visible in
          the **Virtual Machines** tab of SCVMM.
          There might be a warning that SCVMM could not locate the
          boot volume. This is expected and can be ignored.

  2.  In the **Virtual Machine Manager Administrator
      Console**, choose **Virtual Machines**,
      open the shortcut menu for the virtual machine displayed in the
      list, and then choose **Start**. If the
      virtual machine does not start, review the information located on
      the following sites to identify the cause of the problem:

      -   [New Installation of SCVMM 2008](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=139442)

      -   [System Center Virtual Machine Manager TechCenter](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=139443)

  3.  After the **Status** of the VM is 
      **Running**, open the shortcut menu for the VM, and
      then choose **Stop**.

      This confirms that your Hyper-V hosts are configured correctly.

  4.  To store the virtual machine in the library, open the shortcut menu
      for the VM, and then choose **Store in
      library**.

      1.  On the **Select Library Server** wizard
          page, choose one of the library shares.

      2.  On the **Select Path** wizard page,
          browse to the path for your library share that you plan to use
          for your team project collection on Team Foundation Server.

      3.  When you are finished, confirm that a virtual machine called
          **blank** appears in the 
          **Library** pane in the SCVMM
          Administrator Console.

          This confirms that the library share is configured correctly.

You can use the following procedure to improve the performance of
virtual machine transfers from the SCVMM library share to a host and
also when storing a virtual machine to the SCVMM library share. This
performance improvement removes encryption that has security
implications if the images are transmitted unencrypted over the network.

To improve performance of VM transfers:

  1.  Enable unencrypted file transfers for library servers.

      1.  Choose the **Library** tab in the SCVMM
          Administrator console. Open the shortcut menu for each library
          server in the **Library Servers** tree,
          and then choose **Properties**.

      2.  Select **Allow unencrypted file
          transfers**.

      3.  Choose **OK** to close the dialog box.

  2.  Enable unencrypted file transfers for host groups.

      1.  Choose the **Hosts** tab in the SCVMM
          Administrator console. Open the shortcut menu for each host
          group in the **Hosts** tree, and then
          choose **Properties**.

      2.  Select **Allow unencrypted file
          transfers**.

      3.  Choose **OK** to close the dialog box.

### Configure Lab Management for Team Foundation Server

You must configure Lab Management in Team Foundation Server. This
enables access to the virtual machines and templates that you create
from Microsoft Test Manager. You can then use these virtual machines or
templates to create SCVMM environments and store them in a library
share. This requires you to select the SCVMM server to use with Team
Foundation Server.

To configure Lab Management for Team Foundation Server:

  1.  On *TfsMachine*, choose 
      **Start**, **All programs**,
      **Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation
      Server**, and then choose **Team Foundation
      Server Administration Console**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You must log on to *TfsMachine* as *domain(\\*tfsadmin*.

  2.  In the Administration Console, in the 
      **Application Tier** node, choose 
      **Lab Management**.

  3.  Choose **Configure**.

      The **Lab Management Settings** dialog
      box appears.

  4.  On the **Virtual Machine Manager** tab, in
      **VMM Server Name**, type the name of 
      *VmmMachine*, the server that is running
      Virtual Machine Manager and that you will use to manage the
      virtual machines.

  5.  Choose **Test **to determine whether Team
      Foundation Server can communicate with the SCVMM server.

      1.  If Team Foundation Server service account does not have the
          appropriate permissions on the specified SCVMM, a dialog box
          prompts you for a user name and password.

      2.  Specify the credentials of an existing member of SCVMM
          Administrators Role. By using this user name and password, the
          Team Foundation Server service account will be added to the
          SCVMM Administrator Role.

      If Team Foundation Server cannot contact the SCVMM server, a red x
      and an error message is displayed. For more information about how to
      troubleshoot installation issues, see [Troubleshooting Lab
      Management](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee853230(v=vs.120).aspx).

  6.  You can use network isolation in Visual Studio Lab Management to
      enable multiple copies of a lab environment to run at the same time
      without causing network conflicts, such as conflicts in computer
      names and Domain Name System (DNS) registration. For more
      information about network isolation, see [Creating and using
      a network isolated
      environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee518924(v=vs.120).aspx).
      On the **Network Isolation** tab, follow
      these steps:

      1.  In **IP Block**, type the range of
          Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to be assigned to the virtual
          machines in an environment when an isolated network is created.

          You must type the IP Block using Classless Inter-Domain
          Routing (CIDR) notation. The CIDR notation is constructed from
          the IP address, the forward slash (/), and the prefix size. For
          example, 192.168.0.0/24.

          The addresses that you specify are used only for internal
          routing among virtual machines and are not exposed beyond the
          boundaries of an environment. Therefore, you can specify any
          address range that is not used within your public network. In
          most cases, you can use the default range of 192.168.23.0/24.

      2.  In **DNS Suffix**, type the suffix of the
          domain name to be assigned to the environment when an isolated
          network is created.

          Team Foundation Server uses the suffix that you entered when it
          registers a unique external name with DNS for each virtual
          machine in a network-isolated environment. The DNS alias record
          makes it possible for machines and other objects outside the
          isolated network to communicate with machines inside the
          isolated network. Because Team Foundation Server goes into the
          DNS zone to register the alias record, the service account under
          which Team Foundation runs must have permissions to add or
          delete alias records in the specified DNS zone.

          If your Team Foundation Server deployment has more than one
          application tier and each application tier runs under a
          different service account, then each application-tier service
          account must have permission to edit the DNS alias records
          created by the other application tiers.

          Choose **Test **to determine whether Team
          Foundation Server can use the suffix.

          If the suffix is valid, a green check mark appears. Choose 
          **OK**.

          If the suffix is not valid, a red x and an error message appear.
          You must fix the error before you can continue.

  7.  If your deployment of Team Foundation Server has more than one
      application-tier machine, repeat the following steps on each of the
      other application-tier machines:

      1.  In the Team Foundation Administration Console, choose the 
          **Application Tier** node, choose 
          **Lab Management,** and then choose 
          **Reconfigure**.

          The **Lab Management Settings** dialog
          box appears.

      2.  Choose the **Virtual Machine Manager**
          tab, and then choose **Test** to
          determine whether the application tier can communicate
          with SCVMM.

          If the Team Foundation Server service account does not have the
          correct permissions on the specified SCVMM, a dialog box is
          displayed prompting you for a user name and password. Type the
          credentials of an existing member of SCVMM Administrators role.
          When you type this user name and password and choose 
          **OK**, the Team Foundation Server service
          account of this application tier will be added to the SCVMM
          Administrator role.

## Configure Lab Management for Each Team Project Collection

You must configure the host group and library share from SCVMM that you
want to use with each team project collection. For example, you might
decide to allocate one host group to each team project collection to
evenly divide the virtual machine resources.

To use the workflow capability from a Team Foundation Build build
definition to deploy your application, or run tests by using a test
controller on your SCVMM environments, you must add a domain user
account that will be used by test agents and build agents.

> [!NOTE]
> You must have a team project collection already created for this step of
> the configuration.

To configure Lab Management for each team project collection:

  1.  To select the library share to use to store virtual machines,
      templates, and SCVMM environments, choose **Team
      Project Collections** under **Application
      Tier**.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > You must configure a library share for each team project collection that
      > you want to configure for Lab Management.

  2.  In the right-side pane, choose the appropriate team project
      collection from the list of project collections.

  3.  Choose the **Lab Management** tab, and then
      choose **Configure Library Shares**.

      The **Lab Management Settings** dialog
      box appears.

  4.  On the **Library Shares** tab, choose 
      **Add and Verify**.

      The Select Library Shares dialog box appears.

  5.  In the **Select Library Shares** dialog box,
      choose one or more SCVMM library shares that this team project
      collection will use, and then choose **Add**.

      The verify process now confirms that Team Foundation Server can
      connect to the library share. If the verification fails, then a log
      is generated. You can view the log to identify the problems and then
      fix them. When they are fixed, you can choose 
      **Verify** to confirm that Team Foundation Server
      can connect to the library share.

  6.  To add the library share to each team project in the team project
      collection, select the **Auto Provision**
      check box for the library share.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you select to auto-provision the library share, Team Foundation
      > Server automatically adds the library share to all the team projects in
      > this team project collection. For team projects that have not yet been
      > created, the library share is added when the New Team Project wizard
      > creates the project. For team projects that have already been created in
      > this team project collection, the library share is added when these
      > settings are saved. If you clear Auto Provision the library share will
      > no longer be added to new team projects that you add to your team
      > project collection.

  7.  To select the host group to use for a team project collection,
      choose **Host Groups**.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > You must select the host group for each team project collection that you
      > want to configure for Lab Management.

  8.  On the **Host Groups** tab, choose 
      **Add and Verify**.

  9.  In the **Select Host Groups** dialog box,
      choose one or more SCVMM host groups that this team project
      collection will use, and then choose **Add**.

  10. To add the host group to each team project in the team project
      collection, choose the **Auto Provision**
      check box for the host group.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you select to auto-provision the host group, Team Foundation Server
      > automatically adds the host group to all the team projects in this team
      > project collection. For team projects that have not yet been created,
      > the host group is added when the New Team Project wizard creates
      > the project. For team projects that have already been created in this
      > team project collection, the host group is added when these settings
      > are saved. If you clear **Auto Provision**, the
      > host group will no longer be added to new team projects that you add to
      > your team project collection.


<a name="build-test-controller"></a>
## Install a Test Controller

You can use Lab Management to deploy an application to your SCVMM
environment and also to run tests on that environment. This requires a
test controller. For more information about how to run tests using test
settings and environments, see [Setting Up Test Machines to Run
Tests or Collect Data](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd293551(v=vs.120).aspx).

To install the test controller:

  1.  Install the test controller on 
      *ControllerMachine* or on a
      different machine. For information about how to install and
      configure a test controller, see [Installing and Configuring
      Test Agents and Test
      Controllers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd648127(v=vs.120).aspx).

      > [!NOTE]
      > You must register the test controller with the team project collection
      > that you are using for Lab Management.

  2.  Specify the user account to use for communication between the test
      agents and build agents and between the test controllers and Team
      Foundation Server.

      > [!WARNING]
      > The service account that you specify must be a domain account. For
      > security reasons, this account must have limited privileges. The account
      > that you use must not have any administrative permission or be the
      > account that is used by any trusted service. This includes the build
      > controller and test controller.
      >
