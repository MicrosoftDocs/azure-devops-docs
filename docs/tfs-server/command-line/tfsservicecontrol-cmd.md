# TFSServiceControl Command

**TFS 2017** | **TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

You can use the **TFSServiceControl** command to stop or start all of the services and application pools Team Foundation Server (TFS) uses. For example, you use this command when backing up or restoring databases, or when you are moving your deployment from one machine to another.

> [!NOTE]
> You must use the **TFSServiceControl** command to ensure that all necessary operations, services, and application pools are stopped for maintenance tasks such as backup and restore. You cannot manually perform all of the tasks carried out by the **TFSServiceControl** command.

**Requirements**

-   You must be a member of the Team Foundation Administrators security group, a member of the Administrators group on the application-tier server, and a member of the sysadmin security group for any SQL Server databases that TFS uses. See [Set administrator permissions for Team Foundation Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ed578715-f4d2-4042-b797-5f97abde9973).

-   Even if you log on with administrative credentials, you must open an elevated Command Prompt window to perform this function.
