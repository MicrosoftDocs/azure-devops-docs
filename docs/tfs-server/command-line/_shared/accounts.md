Use the **Accounts** command to manage these TFS service accounts.
- the TFS service account
- the data sources account for SQL Server Reporting Services
- the TFS Proxy service account

You can also use this command to change the ownership of the TFS databases.

		[/AccountType:{AdminConsole|ApplicationTier|Proxy|ReportingDataSource}]
		[/Account:AccountName] [/Password:Password]
		[/SQLInstance:ServerName] [/DatabaseName:DatabaseName] [/Continue] [/usesqlalwayson]

### Required permissions

To use the **Accounts** command, you must be a member of
- the Team Foundation Administrators security group
- the sysadmin role for all SQL Server instances that your TFS instance uses.

If you use the **/proxy** option, you must be an administrator on the proxy server.

For more information, see [Permission reference for Team Foundation Server](../../../security/permissions.md)>.

### Remarks

Use the **Accounts** command to automate changes to the service accounts, databases, and service account groups of Team Foundation Server. You can configure accounts that you have already created, but you can't create accounts.

Before you change the domain or workgroup of an account, the account must have the <span sdata="langKeyword" value="Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated"> Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated </span> permission on the application-tier server. For more information, see this page on the Microsoft Web site: [Enabling Delegated Authentication](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=98742).

The **Accounts** command supports on-premises TFS deployments. To change the account owner of a VSTS account, 
see [Change account ownership](http://www.visualstudio.com/get-started/change-account-ownership-vs).

### Examples

Change the service account of data sources for Reporting Services to a new account in the Contoso domain, Contoso\\NewAccount, and the password, to Password.

    TFSConfig Accounts /change /AccountType:ReportingDataSource /Account:Contoso\NewAccount /Password:Password

Add the Network Service system account to the service account groups for Team Foundation Server. (System accounts don't have passwords.)

    TFSConfig Accounts /add /AccountType:ApplicationTier /Account:"NT Authority\Network Service"

Change the ownership of the "TFS\_Warehouse" database on the "ContosoMain" SQL Server in the "TeamDatabases" named instance to the user account under which you are running the command.

>**Note:**  
>You can't specify what account to set as the owner of the databases when you use this command. The owner will be set to the account under which you are running the command.

    TFSConfig Accounts /ResetOwner /SQLInstance:ContosoMain\TeamDatabases /DatabaseName:TFS_Warehouse
