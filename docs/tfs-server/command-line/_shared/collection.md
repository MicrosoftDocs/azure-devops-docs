You can use the **Collection** command to attach, detach, or delete a team project collection from a deployment of TFS.
You can also use the **Collection** command to duplicate the database of an existing collection, rename it, and attach it to the deployment.
This process is sometimes referred to as cloning a collection.
However, you cannot use the **Collection** command to create a team project collection.

	TFSConfig Collection {/attach | /detach | /delete} [/collectionName:CollectionName]
		[/collectionDB:ServerName;DatabaseName] [/clone]

### Required permissions

To use the **Collections** command, you must be a member of the Team Foundation Administrators security group as well as the local Administrators group on the machine running **TFSConfig**. You must also be a member of the sysadmin security role for all instances of SQL Server used by TFS databases. If your deployment is integrated with SharePoint and you are using the **/delete** option, you must also be a member of the Farm Administrators group for the SharePoint farm from which you are deleting the site collection. 

For more information, see [Permission reference for Team Foundation Server](../../../security/permissions.md).

### Remarks

To manage collections interactively or to create a collection, you can use the Team Project Collections node in the administration console for Team Foundation.
See [Manage team project collections](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/80848156-fa61-4f13-aea7-2bc47c59d9bf).

### Examples

The following example shows how to permanently remove the "Contoso Summer Intern Projects" team project collection from a deployment of Team Foundation Server.
