# Configure Lab Management with TFSLabConfig

**TFS 2017** | **TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013** | **TFS 2012** | **TFS 2010**

Team Foundation Server includes a command-line tool to help you configure and manage the lab service provide by Visual Studio Lab Management.

The **TFSLabConfig** command-line tool is located in Drive:\Program Files\TFS <version>\Tools on Team Foundation Server application tier -- by default, this will be:
- TFS 2015: `%programfiles%\TFS 14.0\Tools`
- TFS 2013: `%programfiles%\TFS 12.0\Tools`
- TFS 2012: `%programfiles%\TFS 11.0\Tools`
- TFS 2010: `%programfiles%\TFS 2010\Tools`

It is also located in Drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio &lt;version&gt;\Common7\IDE on the client machine where Microsoft Test Manager is installed.

**Required Permissions:**

To use TFSLabConfig, you must have the appropriate permissions for the operation that you want to perform. The required permissions are described for each command in the command reference topic.
