# Change groups and permissions with TFSSecurity

**VSTS** | **TFS 2017** | **TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

You can use the **TFSSecurity** command-line tool to create, modify, and delete groups and users in Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS), in addition to modifying permissions for groups and users. For information about how to perform these tasks in the user interface, see <span sdata="link"> Manage users or groups </span>.

This server-level tool is located in Drive:\\%programfiles%\\TFS 12.0\\Tools on the TFS application-tier server.

> Even if you are logged on with administrative credentials,
> you must open an elevated Command Prompt to perform this function.

## Use with VSTS
The **TFSSecurity** command-line tool can be used with Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) as well. To use it for VSTS, use the same commands as TFS but replace the *CollectionURL* with your *AccountURL* (ServerURL is not applicable with VSTS). 

### Example:
```
tfssecurity /a+ Namespace Token Action Identity (ALLOW | DENY)[/collection:AccountURL]
```

> While this tool is supported, we recommend using our [Security REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts/security/) when working with security groups and permissions in VSTS as our APIs are updated faster and more often.

## Permissions

<a id="aplus"></a>
### /a+: Add permissions
Use **/a+** to add permissions for a user or a group in a server-level, collection-level, or project-level group. To add users to groups from the user interface, see [Manage users or groups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/30493f4c-d3e6-42f0-bca2-2ad749246944).

```
tfssecurity /a+ Namespace Token Action Identity (ALLOW | DENY)[/collection:CollectionURL] [/server:ServerURL]
```

#### Required Permissions

To use the **/a+** command, you must have the View collection-level information or the View instance-level information permission set to Allow, depending on whether you are using the **/collection** or **/server** parameter, respectively. If you are changing permissions for a team project, you must also have the Edit project-level information permission for the team project set to Allow. For more information, see [Permission reference for Team Foundation Server](../../security/permissions.md).

#### Parameters

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Namespace | The namespace that contains the group to which you want to add permissions for a user or group. You can also use the **tfssecurity /a** command to view a list of namespaces at the server, collection, and project level. |
| Token | The name or GUID of the object on which you want to add permissions.<br>**Note:** Tokens vary depending on the namespace you specify. Some namespaces do not have tokens that apply for this command. |
| Action | The name of the permission for which you are granting or denying access. For a list of valid IDs, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/39997de5-b7fb-4777-b779-07de0543abe6">Permission reference for Team Foundation Server</a>, or use the **tfssecurity /a** command to view a list of valid actions for a namespace that you specify. |
| Identity | The identity of the user or the group. For more information about identity specifiers, see [TFSSecurity Identity and Output Specifiers](#specifiers).<br><ul><li>**ALLOW**<br>The group or user can perform the operation that the Action specifies.</li><li>**DENY**<br>The group or user cannot perform the operation that the Action specifies.</li></ul> |
| **/collection** :CollectionURL | Required if **/server** is not used. Specifies the URL of a team project collection in the following format: **http://** ServerName **:** Port **/** VirtualDirectoryName **/** CollectionName |
| **/server** :ServerURL | Required if **/collection** is not used. Specifies the URL of an application-tier server in the following format: **http://** ServerName **:** Port **/** VirtualDirectoryName |

#### Remarks

Run this command on an application-tier server for Team Foundation.

Access control entries are security mechanisms that determine which operations a user, group, service, or computer is authorized to perform.

#### Examples

The following example displays what namespaces are available at the server level for the application-tier server that is named ADatumCorporation.

### /gc: Create a project-level group
Use **/gc** at a command prompt to create a project-level group. To create a project-level group from the user interface, see <span sdata="link"> Manage users or groups </span>.

	tfssecurity /gc Scope GroupName [GroupDescription] [/collection:CollectionURL]

#### Required Permissions

To use the **/gc** command, you must have the Edit Project-Level Information permission for that team project set to Allow. For more information, see <span sdata="link"> Permission reference for Team Foundation Server </span>.

#### Parameters

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|Scope|The URI of the team project to which you want to add a project-level group. To obtain the URI for a team project, connect to it, and open Team Explorer, hover over the name of the project in Home, and read the address. Alternatively, connect to the project in Web Access and copy the URL.|
|GroupName|The name of the new group.|
|GroupDescription|A description of the project group. Optional.|
|**/collection** :CollectionURL|The URL of the team project collection. Required. The group will be created within the team project collection. The format for the URL is **http://** ServerName **:** Port **/** VirtualDirectoryName **/** CollectionName|

#### Remarks

Run this command on an application-tier server for Team Foundation.

A project-level group is a security group for your team project. You can use project groups to grant read, write, and administrative permissions that meet the security requirements of your organization.

#### Example

The following example creates a group that is specific to the project that the URI "vstfs://Classification/TeamProject/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" specifies. The group is named "Test Group" and has the description "This group is for testing."

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are for illustration only and are fictitious. No real association is intended or inferred.

You must replace the placeholder GUID with the URI of the team project for which you want to create this group. To obtain the URI for a team project, open Team Explorer, right-click the team project, click Properties, and copy the entire value of the URL property.

After you run the command, you can verify the group in Team Explorer. Right-click the team project that you used in the command, click Team Project Settings, and then click Group Memberships. In the Project Groups on  TeamProjectName dialog box, the Groups list includes Test Group .

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the **/gc** command to create groups but not to add any users to the groups or assign any permissions. To change the membership of the group, see [/g+: Add a user or another group to an existing group](#gplus) and [/g-: Remove a user or group](#gminus). To change the permissions for the group, see [/a+: Add permissions](#aplus) and [/a-: Remove a user or a group from membership in a group](#aminus).

    tfssecurity /gc "vstfs:///Classification/TeamProject/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" "Test Group"
		"This group is for team members who test our code" /collection:CollectionURL

<a id="gcg"></a>
### /gcg: Create a server or collection-level group
Use the **/gcg** command to create a server-level or collection-level group. To create a server-level or collection-level group from the user interface, see [Manage users or groups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/30493f4c-d3e6-42f0-bca2-2ad749246944).

	tfssecurity /gcg GroupName [GroupDescription] [/collection:CollectionURL] [/server:ServerURL]

#### Required Permissions

To use the **/gcg** command, you must have the Edit project-level information permission for that team project set to Allow. For more information, see [Permission reference for Team Foundation Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/39997de5-b7fb-4777-b779-07de0543abe6).

#### Parameters

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|GroupName|The group name.|
|GroupDescription|A description of the group. Optional.|
|**/collection** :CollectionURL|Required if **/server** is not used. Specifies the URL of a team project collection in the following format: **http://** ServerName **:** Port **/** VirtualDirectoryName **/** CollectionName|
|**/server** :ServerURL|Required if **/collection** is not used. Specifies the URL of an application-tier server in the following format: **http://** ServerName **:** Port **/** VirtualDirectoryName|

#### Remarks

Run this command on an application-tier server for Team Foundation.

Server-level groups are created directly on the application tier and apply to all team project collections. Collection-level are created at the team project collection level. They apply to that collection and have implications for all team projects within the collection. In contrast, team project groups apply to a specific project within a collection but not any other projects in that collection. You can assign permissions to server-level groups so that members of those groups can perform tasks in Team Foundation Server (TFS) itself, such as creating team project collections. You can assign permissions to collection-level groups so that members of those groups can perform tasks across a team project collection, such as administering users.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the <b>/gcg</b> command to create groups, but you cannot use it to add any users to the groups or assign any permissions. For information about how to change the membership of a group, see [/g+: Add a user or another group to an existing group](#gplus) and [/g-: Remove a user or group](#gminus). For information about how to change the permissions for the group, see [/a+: Add permissions](#aplus) and [/a-: Remove a user or a group from membership in a group](#aminus).

#### Example

The following example creates a collection-level group that is named "Datum Testers" with the description "A. Datum Corporation Testers."

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are for illustration only and are fictitious. No real association is intended or inferred.

    tfssecurity /gcg "Datum Testers" "A. Datum Corporation Testers" /collection:CollectionURL

### /m: Check explicit and implicit group membership
Use **/m** to check explicit and implicit group membership information for a specified group or user.

	tfssecurity /m GroupIdentity [MemberIdentity] [/collection:CollectionURL] [/server:ServerURL]

#### Required Permissions

To use the **/m** command, you must be a member of the Team Foundation Administrators security group. For more information, see [Permission reference for Team Foundation Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/39997de5-b7fb-4777-b779-07de0543abe6).

> [!NOTE]
> Even if you are logged on with administrative credentials, you must open an elevated Command Prompt to perform this function.

#### Parameters

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|GroupIdentity|Specifies the group identity. For more information on valid identity specifiers, see [TFSSecurity Identity and Output Specifiers](#specifiers).|
|MemberIdentity|Specifies the member identity. By default, the value of this argument is the identity of the user who is running the command. For more information on valid identity specifiers, see [TFSSecurity Identity and Output Specifiers](#specifiers).|
|**/collection** :CollectionURL|Required if **/server** is not used. Specifies the URL of a team project collection in the following format: **http://** ServerName **:** Port **/** VirtualDirectoryName **/** CollectionName|
|**/server** :ServerURL|Required if **/collection** is not used. Specifies the URL of an application-tier server in the following format: **http://** ServerName **:** Port **/** VirtualDirectoryName|

#### Remarks

Run this command on the local application-tier computer.

The **/m** command of the **TFSSecurity** command-line utility checks both direct and extended memberships.

#### Examples

The following example verifies whether the user "Datum1\\jpeoples" belongs to the Team Foundation Administrators server-level group.

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are for illustration only and are fictitious. No real association is intended or inferred.

```cmdline
tfssecurity /m "Team Foundation Administrators" n:Datum1\jpeoples /server:http://ADatumCorporation:8080

## Identity specifiers

You can reference an identity by using one of the notations in the following table.

|Identity specifier|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**sid:** Sid.|References the identity that has the specified security identifier (SID).|**sid:S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-588340**|
|**n:**[D omain\]Name|References the identity that has the specified name. For Windows, Name is the account name. If the referenced identity is in a domain, the domain name is required. For application groups, Name is the group display name, and Domain is the URI or GUID of the containing project. In this context, if Domain is omitted, the scope is assumed to be at the collection level.|To reference the identity of the user &quot;John Peoples&quot; in the domain &quot;Datum1&quot; at the fictitious company &quot;A. Datum Corporation:&quot;<br /><br />**n:DATUM1\jpeoples**<br /><br />To reference application groups:<br /><br />**n:&quot;Full-time Employees&quot;**<br /><br />**n:00a10d23-7d45-4439-981b-d3b3e0b0b1ee\Vendors**|
|**adm:**[Scope]|References the administrative application group for the scope, such as &quot;Team Foundation Administrators&quot; for the server level or &quot;Project Collection Administrators&quot; at the collection level. The optional parameter Scope is a project URI or URL, including its GUID and connection string. If scope is omitted, the server or collection scope is assumed based on whether the /instance or /server parameter is used. In either case, the colon is still required.|**adm:vstfs:///Classification/TeamProject/** GUID|
|**srv:**|References the application group for service accounts.|Not applicable|
|**all:**|References all groups and identities.|Not applicable|
|String|References an unqualified string. If String starts with **S-1-**, it is identified as a SID. If String starts with **CN=** or **LDAP://** it is identified as a distinguished name. Otherwise, String is identified as a name.|&quot;Team testers&quot;|

## Type Markers
