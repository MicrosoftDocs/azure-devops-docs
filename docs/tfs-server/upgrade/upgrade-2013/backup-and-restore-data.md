# Back up and restore data for TFS

**TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

![back up and restore data](../_img/backup-dbs.png)


## How to back up and restore TFS data to new hardware

If you haven't installed TFS on the new hardware yet, you'll want to
do that now. You can use TFS custom backup and restore tools to manage
your data.

> **Tip:**
> If you're upgrading from TFS 2012 with update 2 (TFS 2012.2) or
> higher, you can use the TFS built-in functionality to create your back
> up and restore it.

First you're going to back up your data, including the encryption key
on the report server that you used with the previous version of TFS.
Next, you're going to restore your data to the SQL Server instance you
set up in step 2. With the restore complete, you'll use the SQL Server
Reporting tool to restart the report server database, restore its
encryption key, and then verify access to the report server. If you
installed SharePoint, you'll use a SharePoint command line tool to
attach and upgrade your content database.

**Required Permissions**

You must be a member of the administrators security group on Windows
server of the new hardware and the old.

If you plan to configure reporting, you must also be a member of the
administrators security group on the server that is running SQL Server
Reporting Services. If you plan to configure SharePoint Products, you
must be a member of the farm administrators group on the SharePoint
Products administration site. If you did not install the Database Engine
that will host the configuration database or a database administrator
manages the instance of SQL Server that you are using, you must be a
member of sysadmin Server role in SQL Server.


### Back up your data

If you haven't installed TFS on the new hardware yet, you'll want to
do that now to access the TFS custom backup and restore tools. You're
going to back up all of your TFS data, including the encryption key for
the report server.

> [!TIP]
> All your data needs to be backed up to the same point in time in order
> for the restore and upgrade to work correctly. The only reason to not
> back up a database would be, for example, if you have reporting in the
> old TFS instance, but you're not going to use reporting in the new TFS
> instance.

To run the Team Foundation Server installer:

  1.  Insert the Team Foundation Server DVD in the drive and launch the
      tfs\_server.exe file to begin the installation.

  2.  On the license terms dialog box, accept the license terms and then
      choose **Install Now**.

      If you want to install Team Foundation Server to a specific location
      in the file system, choose the browse button (...) next to the
      default install location.

To back up the encryption key for reporting services:

  1.  Launch **Reporting Services Configuration
      Manager**.

      The Reporting Services Configuration Connection dialog box opens.

  2.  Specify the name of the report server you used with the previous
      version of TFS and then choose **Connect**.

  3.  In the navigation bar on the left side, choose 
      **Encryption Keys**, and then choose 
      **Backup**.

      The Encryption Key Information dialog box opens.

  4.  In **File Location**, specify the location
      where you want to store a copy of this key.

      Consider storing this key on the new hardware, so that it's easily
      accessible when you restore the Reporting Services databases.

  5.  In **Password**, specify a password for
      the file.

      Don't forget the password! You'll need it later on to restore
      the Reporting Services databases.

  6.  In **Confirm Password**, specify the password
      for the file again.

  7.  Choose **OK**.

To back up your databases:

  1.  Launch TFSBackup.exe.

      The TFSBackup.exe tool is in the Tools folder where you installed
      Team Foundation Server. The default location is C:\\Program
      Files\\TFS 12.0\\Tools.

  2.  In **Source SQL Server Instance**, enter the
      name of the SQL Server instance that hosts the TFS databases you
      want to back up and choose **Connect**.

  3.  In Select databases to backup, choose the databases to back up.

      For more hlep: [List of TFS 2010 databases on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms400720(v=vs.100).aspx) and 
      [List of TFS 2012 databases on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms400720(v=vs.110).aspx).

  4.  In **Backup Databases to**, enter the name of
      a network share that is configured with read/write access for
      Everyone, or accept the default location in the file system of the
      SQL Server you connected to in step 2.

        > **Note:**
        > If you want to overwrite backups stored in this network location, you
        > can choose **Overwrite existing database backups at
        > this location**.

  5.  Choose **Backup Now**.

      The Backup tool reports progress on each database being backed up.

  6.  Choose **Close**.


### Restore your data

To restore your TFS data:

  1.  Launch TFSRestore.exe.

      The TFSRestore.exe tool is in the Tools folder where you installed
      Team Foundation Server. The default location is C:\\Program
      Files\\TFS 12.0\\Tools.

  2.  In **Target SQL Server Instance**, enter the
      SQL Server instance you will use as the data tier and choose 
      **Connect**.

  3.  Choose **Add Share** and enter the UNC path
      to the network share that is configured with read/write access to
      Everyone where you stored the backups of your TFS data. For
      example, \\\\servername\\sharename\\.

      If the backup files are located on the file system of the server
      that is running TFSRestore.exe, you can use the drop down box to
      select a local drive.

        > **Note:**
        > The service account for the instance of SQL Server you identified at the
        > start of this procedure must have read access to this share.

  4.  In the left hand navigation pane, choose the network share or local
      disk you identified in the previous step.

      The TFS Restore Tool displays the database backups stored on the
      file share.

  5.  Select the check boxes for the databases you want to restore to the
      SQL Server you identified at the start of this procedure.

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > For SharePoint, you must only restore the WSS\_Content database. Do not
        > restore the WSS\_AdminContent or WSS\_Config databases. You want the new
        > SharePoint Foundation versions of these databases, not the ones from the
        > previous version of SharePoint or from a SharePoint installation running
        > on any other server.

  6.  Choose **Overwrite the existing database(s)**
      and then choose **Restore**.

      The Database Restore Tool restores your data and displays
      progress reports.

  7.  Choose **Close**.
