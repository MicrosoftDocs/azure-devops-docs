# Locate or Change the Product Key for Team Foundation Server

**TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**


To move from the trial edition to the full edition of Team Foundation Server, you must have a valid product key for Team Foundation Server. 

You can review the license type, license expiration date, and product key number of your deployment of Team Foundation Server. Problems with an expired or non-valid product key can disrupt your deployment. If you installed a trial edition of Team Foundation Server, you should be careful not to let the license expire. After the license expires, your users will be unable to use Team Foundation Server until you take steps to correct the situation. You might also need to locate the product key of Team Foundation Server for support or record-keeping purposes.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have any issues during the licensing upgrade process, you can contact support for Visual Studio. For more information, see the following page on the Microsoft Web site: [Help and Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=108287) and the [Team Foundation Server Licensing Whitepaper](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=253211).

**Required Permissions**

To perform these procedures, you must be a member of the Administrators security group on the application-tier server for Team Foundation Server and a member of the Team Foundation Administrators group.

## To locate or change your product key

1. Open the administration console of Team Foundation Server.

2. Expand the name of the server, and review the information in Product ID, License Type, and License Expires.

  The number that appears in Product ID is your product key.

3. (Optional) If you must change or update your product key, choose Update License.

  The Team Foundation Server License window opens.

4. Type the product key, and then choose Activate.


## Where to find your product key if it does not appear in the administration console
