# Upgrade from TFS 2005 to TFS 2015

**TFS 2017** | **TFS 2015** | **TFS 2013**

Direct upgrade to TFS 2015 is not supported for anything older than 2010,
so to upgrade from TFS 2005,
you'll upgrade first to TFS 2010,
then to TFS 2015.

## 1. Backup your databases

If you're moving to new hardware,
you'll use the [backups of your TFS databases](../admin/backup/back-up-restore-tfs.md) to do that.
If you're upgrading TFS in place, the backups are there in case you decide not to complete the upgrade at this time.

## 2. Upgrade your SQL instance

Since TFS 2005 only supports SQL 2005 and TFS 2010 only supports SQL 2008 and SQL 2008 R2,
you'll have to upgrade your existing data tier,
or install a supported version of SQL on a new data tier and then restore your backed up DBs.
 
## 3. Install TFS 2010 on the application tier

Either:

- Uninstall TFS 2005 from your existing application tier and then install TFS 2010 on it, or
- Install TFS 2010 on a new application tier. 

The choice you make here may depend on what operating system you want your final TFS 2015 deployment to be on.
TFS 2005 supports Server 2003.
TFS 2010 also supports Server 2003 in addition to Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2.
TFS 2015 supports Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and Server 2012 R2, in addition to various client operating systems.
So, if you want to end up on Server 2012 or later in your 2015 deployment,
you can avoid upgrading your OS twice by sticking with Server 2003 for your TFS 2010 upgrade.
If you want to end up on Server 2008 R2,
you can jump straight to it for your TFS 2010 upgrade and then stick with it for the 2015 upgrade.

## 4. Upgrade your databases to TFS 2010

Run through the TFS 2010 upgrade wizard to upgrade your databases.
If you had reporting configured in TFS 2005,
be sure to keep it configured in your TFS 2010 upgrade.

## 5. Backup your databases again

Same thing, you'll use them for moving to new hardware, or have them in case you decide not to complete the upgrade.

## 6. Upgrade your SQL instance again.

You'll need to upgrade your SQL instance again,
since TFS 2015 only supports SQL 2012 SP1 and SQL 2014.

Either:

- Upgrade SQL on your existing data tier, or
- Install a supported version of SQL on a new data tier and then restore your backed up DBs.

## 7. Install TFS 2015 on the application tier

Either:

- Uninstall TFS 2010 from your existing application tier and then install TFS 2015 on it, or
- Install TFS 2015 on a new application tier.

## 8. Upgrade your databases to TFS 2015

Run through the TFS 2015 upgrade wizard to upgrade your databases.
If you had reporting configured in TFS 2005,
be sure to keep it configured in your TFS 2015 upgrade. 

## 9. Upgrade SharePoint

If you had SharePoint configured in your TFS 2005 deployment,
you'll need to upgrade your SharePoint instance.
TFS 2005 supported SharePoint 2.0. TFS 2015 supports SharePoint 2010 and 2013.
After upgrading your SharePoint instance,
you'll need to install TFS 2015 on it and configure SharePoint Extensions.
