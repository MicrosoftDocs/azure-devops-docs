Before you start tracking work, you must have a team project. To create one hosted in the cloud, see [Sign up for VSTS](/vsts/user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates). To create one hosted on an on-premises TFS, see [Create a team project](/vsts/accounts/create-team-project).   

If you have a team project, start tracking work:  

-   [Add work items to manage a project](/vsts/work/backlogs/add-work-items) - to gain more familiarity with the work item form features  
-   [Create a backlog](/vsts/work/backlogs/create-your-backlog) - to develop your product backlog   
-   [Plan a sprint](/vsts/work/scrum/sprint-planning) - to start working in Scrum    
-   [Kanban](/vsts/work/kanban/kanban-basics)  - to start working in Kanban  
-   [Excel](/vsts/work/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel) or [Project](/vsts/work/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project) - to create a work breakdown structure
