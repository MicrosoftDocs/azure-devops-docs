### Use multi-select to bulk modify items

Multi-select of work items on the product and sprint backlogs works in the same way as multi-select works within query results. 

<!---
> [!NOTE]     
><b>Feature availability: </b> Multi-select of work items on the backlog and sprint backlogs is currently supported from VSTS and TFS 2015.1 and later versions. This feature works in the same way as multi-select works within query results. 
-->

With multi-select, you can perform several actions on several work items at once, such as: 

- Add links
- Change one or more field values
- Change the backlog priority   
- Assign to a team member
- Move to a sprint
- [Map items or change the parent an item is linked to](/vsts/work/backlogs/organize-backlog#mapping)


Multi-select of backlog work items requires TFS 2015.1 or later version.


To select several items in a sequence, hold down the shift key. To select several non-sequential items, use the Ctrl key. Then, you can either drag the selected items to a new position within the backlog, to a different sprint, or select an option from the context (![context icon](../_img/icons/context_menu.png)) or action (![actions icon](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png)) menu of one of the items.
