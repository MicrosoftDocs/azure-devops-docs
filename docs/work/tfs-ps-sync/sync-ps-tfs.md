# Synchronize TFS with Project Server, third-party support  

<b>TFS 2017 | [TFS 2015 | TFS 2013](synchronize-tfs-project-server.md)</b>

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>TFS 2017 and later versions no longer support native integration with Office Project Server. If you're working with an on-premises TFS 2015 or TFS 2013, see [Synchronize TFS with Project Server](synchronize-tfs-project-server.md).

If you are on a prior version of Team Foundation Server with the native integration installed and configured, the native integration will no longer work
once you upgrade to TFS 2017 or later version.

For more information on why we no longer support this integration, please read this blog post, [Microsoft discontinuing Project Server/TFS Integration. Partner to provide solution](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=823693).

## Synchronization support for TFS 2017 and Project Server

## [Tasktop](http://www.tasktop.com/product-overview)
 
Tasktop provides enterprise-grade integration between Microsoft Project Server and TFS/VSTS, as well as to most other popular Agile, DevOps and Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC) tools. This integration automates the flow of artifacts (such as work items and tasks) across these tools, eliminating wasted time and bottlenecks while increasing velocity, collaboration and even employee satisfaction! In addition, Tasktop can automatically collect the activity data into a central database, enabling the creation of consolidated dashboards and reports, allowing for greater project visibility and artifact traceability. 
 
[Tasktop's unique model-based integration approach](https://www.tasktop.com/product-overview) dramatically reduces the time and effort it takes to integrate tools; this is particularly important for larger organizations with many tools (and tool instances), hundreds of projects within those tools, thousands of users, and millions of work items and tasks.

## Remove TFS-Project Server integration for a TFS instance upgraded to TFS 2017  

When you upgrade TFS 2015 or earlier version which has the native TFS-Project Server integration configured, remnants of the integration remain. You may choose to ignore them, or you can remove them to avoid receiving error messages. See [Remove integration of TFS with Project Server](remove-tfs-ps-integration.md).
