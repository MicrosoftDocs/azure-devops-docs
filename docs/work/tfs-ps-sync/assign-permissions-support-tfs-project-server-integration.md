# Assign permissions to support TFS-Project Server integration

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/tfs-ps-sync-header.md)]

<a name="Top"></a> Assigning permissions is the first step in configuring Team Foundation Server and Project Server to support data synchronization. You must grant permissions to several accounts&mdash;administrators, service accounts, and team members. You must also make sure that specific service accounts have access as a Shared Services Provider (SSP) for the server that hosts SharePoint Products for Project Server.  
  
 You should grant permissions after you have installed Team Foundation Server Extensions for Project Server Integration. For more information, see [System and setup requirements](system-and-setup-requirements.md).  
  
## Before you begin  
 Before you begin, you'll want to know which Project Web Access or Project Web App (PWA) instances and TFS team project collections will participate in data synchronization. You'll also want to have answers to the following questions.  
  
###  <a name="assign_perm"></a> Do you have all the permissions you need to assign permissions?  
 Make sure you belong to the following groups:  
  
-   **Team Foundation Administrators** group, required to grant TFS permissions. You must also have access to the **Team Foundation Administration Console**. [Add accounts to administer TFS](../../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).  
  
-   **Administrator for Project Web App**  for each instance of PWA, required to grant Project Server permissions. You must also have access to Project Server through PWA.  
  
-   **Administrators** security group for the SQL Server databases for Project Server, required to grant permissions to the PWA Reporting and Publishing databases.  
  
-   **Farm Administrators** group, the administrators group for the Web application that supports Project Server, or the **SharePoint Administration** group, required to grant SSP permissions. Group membership will depend on the security architecture of your deployment.  
  
-   Administrator on the local computer, required to use `stsadm.exe`.  
  
###  <a name="auth_mode"></a> Is the authentication mode set correctly for your version of Project Server?  
  
-   **For Project Server 2010**:  
  
     The SharePoint web application for the instance of PWA must be set to **Classic Mode Authentication**. Classic Mode Authentication uses Windows authentication. User accounts are treated by SharePoint Server 2010 as Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) accounts.  
  
     You will not be able to register the PWA if its authentication is set to Claims Based Authentication. If you're not sure which authentication mode is set, or you need to switch authentication modes, [jump to this section](#auth2010).  
  
-   **For Project Server 2013**:  
  
     Two permissions are supported: SharePoint Permission mode and Project Permission mode. Both these modes use Claims Based authorization. The permissions that you need to assign differ, depending on the permission mode that is set.  
  
     SharePoint permissions mode creates SharePoint groups that directly correspond to the default security groups found in Project Server permission mode. These groups are used to grant users varying levels of access to projects and Project Server functionality. SharePoint permission mode is new for Project Server 2013.  
  
     New Project Web App instances use the SharePoint permission mode by default. In an on-premises installation, the mode can be changed for a given instance of Project Web App by using the **Set-SPProjectPermissionModeWindows** PowerShell cmdlet.  
  
     Project Server permission mode provides a set of customizable security groups and other functionality that is distinct from SharePoint groups. This security platform operates independent from the SharePoint permissions in the farm and allows you to fine tune the permission levels for Project Web App users. This is the same permission mode that was available in Project Server 2010.  
  
     For a comparison of features supported in each security mode, see [Plan user access in Project Server 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/fp161361\(v=office.15\).aspx).  
  
     If you're not sure which Permission mode is set, or you need to switch Permission modes, [jump to this section](#perm2013).  
  
###  <a name="windows_groups"></a> Have you created Windows groups to effectively manage user accounts?  
 To minimize manually adding users to TFS and Project Server, create Windows or Active Directory groups. You can then add these groups to TFS groups, Project Server, and SharePoint sites which have pre-defined permissions. Also, you can synchronize resources with Active Directory across multiple domains and forests.  
  
 For more information, see [Manage security group synchronization with Active Directory in Project Server 2013](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg750243.aspx).  
  
##  <a name="accounts"></a> 1. Identify all the service and user accounts that you need to assign permissions to  
 Identify the service accounts, user accounts, or Active Directory groups that have been configured and will need access to the resources that support data synchronization between TFS and Project Server.  
  
###  <a name="service_accounts"></a> Service accounts  
 Identify the following service accounts:  
  
-   **Service account for TFS**  

     [Open the Team Foundation Administration console](/tfs/server/command-line/open-admin-console). If a Network Service account is used, [change it to a domain account](/tfs/server/admin/change-service-account-password).  
  
-   **Service account for the Project Server Event Handler**  
  
     On the machine where Project Server is installed, open **Computer>Manage Services** and find **Microsoft Project Server Events Service**.  
  
-   **Service account(s) that run the Project server web application pool(s)**  
  
     There might be more than one service account, depending on the number of PWA instances that will participate in TFS data synchronization. You need to identify both the SharePoint appPool hosting PWA and the PSI service appPool. A GUID appPool name could be associated with the PSI service appPool.  
  
    1.  Open SharePoint Central Site Administration, Application Management, Manage Service Application, Project Server Application.  
  
         Find the SharePoint site that hosts the PWA instance. Make a note of the number. It might be under one or more ports, for example, SharePoint 80, or SharePoint web app.  
  
    2.  Open IIS manager, expand sites, and find the SharePoint websites that correspond to the PWA that you identified.  
  
        -   **For Project Server 2010**: Open Advanced settings for the application Pool and you'll find the account identity for the AppPool.  
  
        -   **For Project Server 2013**: Expand SharePoint web services and expand each GUID until you find the one that contains project PSI service. In Advanced settings, identify the Application Pool, which is a GUID pool name.  
  
             ![Find GUID of PSI app pools](_img/alm_iis_findapppoolguid.png "ALM_IIS_FindAppPoolGUID")  
  
             Under IIS, AppPools, find the account used to run this GUID application pool.  
  
             ![Find service accounts of PSI app pools](_img/alm_iis_findapppoolguid_2.png "ALM_IIS_FindAppPoolGUID_2")  
  
### User accounts  
 Identify the following user accounts or groups:  
  
-   User account(s) who will run the `TFSProjectServer registerPWA` command  
  
-   User account(s) who will map components to support TFS-Project Server integration, but not register PWAs  
  
-   Users of Project Professional  
  
-   Users assigned as project resources or have TFS work items assigned to them  
  
     These users submit status updates that flow into the status queue for the project manager  
  
 Depending on the role, you grant permissions to each PWA instance that participates in data synchronization to the SharePoint server, to the enterprise resource pool, and to TFS.  
  
##  <a name="grant_pwa_permissions"></a> 2. Grant permissions to access each PWA instance  
 Do the following tasks, based on the version and permission mode used in your deployment. You must add accounts for each PWA instance that you will register and map to a team project.

 Accounts of users who configure the TFS-Project Server integration require Administer Project Server Integration permission set to allow. Set this for each project collection that you map to a PWA.  
  
 From the Security page for the project collection, either open the permissions for a user account or a Windows account that you've added to TFS for administering project server integration. Set the permissions for Administer Project Server Integration to Allow.

##  <a name="add_twa"></a> 7. Add accounts to Team Foundation groups  
 **Required for:** ![Project Server 2010 Classic Mode](_img/alm_tfs-ps_classicmode.png "ALM_TFS-PS_ClassicMode"), ![Project Server 2013 Permission Mode](_img/alm_tfs-ps_permmode.png "ALM_TFS-PS_PermMode"), and ![Project Server 2013 SharePoint Mode](_img/alm_tfs-ps_spmode.png "ALM_TFS-PS_SPMode")  
  
 Accounts of users who work in Project Professional or TFS require permissions to view or contribute to TFS.  
  
 From the TFS web portal administration Security page for the team project, you can add accounts to either the project collection or each team project. Add accounts or the Active Directory groups to the appropriate roles.  
  
 ![Choose the team project group and add members](_img/addausertoateamprojectgroup.png "Addausertoateamprojectgroup")  
  
 Verify that user accounts or groups have been added to the following TFS groups for each team project that will participate in data synchronization:  
  
-   **Contributor** role: Team members who work in a TFS project that is integrated with Project Server. This includes all user accounts assigned as resources in the project plan or to the Assigned To field for a work item. These users submit status updates that flow into the status queue for the project manager.  
  
-   **Reader** role: Users who modify enterprise project plans that are mapped to a team project.  
  
 For more info, see [Add users to team projects](../../security/add-users-team-project.md).
  
## Permission checklist  
 Use the following checklist to review that all permissions have been set according to your version and authentication mode. Remember that permissions must be granted to accounts for all PWA instances, team projects, and project collections that will participate in data synchronization between TFS and Project Server. If you customize a role or security categories for a role, you might inadvertently remove required permissions.

 **Notes:**  
  
1.  Some deployments might have more than one service account for the Project Server Web Application Pool. See [Service accounts](#service_accounts) to determine the service accounts for these application pools.  
  
2.  The Security Categories assigned to Team Members by default are sufficient; however, if these categories have been customized, then some permissions might have been removed. The following categories are required: **Create New Task or Assignment**, **Create Object Links**, **Open Project**, **View Project Site**, and **View Project Schedule in Project Web App** (Project Server 2010), and **Open Project**, **View Project Site**, and **View Project Schedule in Project Web App** (Project Server 2013, Project permission mode).  
  
## Q & A  

<a name="auth2010"></a>   
###  Q: How do I determine or change the Authentication mode in SharePoint 2010?  
 **A:** From SharePoint 2010 Central Administration site, open Manage web applications from the Application Management section, and then open the PWA application.  
  
 Verify that Classic Mode Authentication is selected.  
  
 ![PWA 2010 Authentication](_img/alm_tfsps_pwa_2010_authentication.png "ALM_TFSPS_PWA_2010_Authentication")  
  
 If it isn't, you'll need to [create a new PWA instance that uses Windows-Classic authentication](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg276326.aspx).  
  
<a name="perm2013"></a> 
###  Q: How do I determine the Permission mode in SharePoint 2013?  
 **A:** From the PWA home page, use the gear icon to open **PWA settings**.  
  
 ![PWA page, select PWA settings](_img/alm_tfsps_pwa_pwasettings.png "ALM_TFSPS_PWA_PWASettings")  
  
 If SharePoint Permissions mode is set, you'll see this page:  
  
 ![PWA Settings when SharePoint Permission mode](_img/alm_tfsps_pwa_sp_settings.png "ALM_TFSPS_PWA_SP_Settings")  
  
 If Project Permissions mode is set, you'll see this page, which includes a section titled **Security**. You'll also see additional links:  
  
 ![PWA Settings when Project Permission mode](_img/alm_tfsps_pwa_pm_settings.png "ALM_TFSPS_PWA_PM_Settings")  
  
### Q: How do I switch permission modes in Project Server 2013?  
 **A:** By default, PWA apps are created using SharePoint permission mode.  
  
 If you switch from SharePoint permission mode to classic Project Server permission mode, you have to manually configure your security permissions structure in Project Server 2013.  Switching between SharePoint permission mode and Project Server permission mode deletes all security-related settings.  
  
 To switch permission mode, see [Set-SPProjectPermissionMode](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj219486.aspx).  
  
### Q: What other resources are available?  
 **A**: You might find answers to additional questions from the following resources:
