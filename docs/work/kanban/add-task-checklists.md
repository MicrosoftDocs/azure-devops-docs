# Add task checklists

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1**

Many teams find Kanban ideal for tracking work as it supports visualizing the flow of work in progress. And, you can quickly add new items and update status. If you're new to working with the Kanban board, see [Kanban basics](kanban-basics.md).  

With task checklists, you continue to enjoy lightweight tracking, while gaining visibility into which tasks are still to be completed and those that are done. Task checklists provide a quick and easy way to track elements of work which are important to support completing a backlog item. Here we see several tasks for work in progress, both yet to do and those completed.

## Add a task or set of tasks 

1. To start adding tasks, open the menu for the work item.  
	::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"  
	<img src="_img/add-tasks-menu-options-vs-ts.png" alt="Open the context menu of a backlog item to add a task" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  
	::: moniker-end
	::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
	<img src="_img/kanban-board-add-task-checklist.png" alt="Open the context menu of a backlog item to add a task" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  
	::: moniker-end

2. If you have a number of tasks to add, simply keep typing your task titles and click Enter.   

	<img src="_img/kanban-board-task-checklists-added.png" alt="Work item with several tasks added" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

3.	If you have details you want to add about a task, open the parent work item and then click the ![links icon](../_img/icons/icon-links-tab-wi.png) links tab. 

	<img src="_img/add-task-checklist-open-task.png" alt="Open parent work item, Links tab" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

4. Double-click the task, or select and press the Enter key, to open it.   

	<img src="_img/kanban-board-open-task-form.png" alt="Open task work item form from task checklist" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  

	Tasks that you create from the Kanban board will show up on your sprint task board. Also, tasks that you create from the [sprint backlog](../scrum/sprint-planning.md) or [taskboard](../scrum/task-board.md) will show up within tasks checklists on the Kanban board.  


## Mark a task as done 

When you complete a task, simply click the checkbox to change its status to Done or Closed. 

<img src="_img/kanban-check-done-tasks.png" alt="Check tasks that are complete" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" />  
 
The State of the work item is updated from To Do to Done for Scrum projects, and from Active to Closed for Agile and CMMI projects.  

## Expand or collapse the task checklist  

Upon first opening the Kanban board, you'll see an unexpanded view of checklists.

<img src="_img/kanban-board-first-open-collapsed-checklists.png" alt="Expand task checklist for a work item" style="border: 1px solid #C3C3C3;" /> 

Simply click the task checklist summary to expand a collapsed task checklist. Click the same summary to collapse an expanded checklist. 

## Reorder and reparent tasks or reassign them to a sprint

Tasks that you create from the Kanban board are automatically assigned to the sprint/iteration path of the parent work item under which you define them. 

You can drag a task within a work item to reorder it. Or, you can drag the task to another work item on the Kanban board to reparent it. 

![Drag tasks to reorder them within the list](_img/task-checklist-reorder-tasks.png)  

To reassign a task to a different sprint, you must open the sprint backlog where it's currently defined and then drag it to the new sprint.  

## Customize the Kanban board 
To customize or change the layout of the board, see one of these topics. 

* [Add columns](add-columns.md)  
* [WIP limits](wip-limits.md)  
* [Add swimlanes, expedite work](expedite-work.md)   
* [Customize cards](../customize/customize-cards.md)  
* [Split columns](split-columns.md)   
* [Definition of Done](definition-of-done.md)  

## Q & A

### Q: If I manage bugs with tasks, can I add bugs as a checklist to a required? 
**A:** No. Task checklists only support the task work item type. 
 

## Related articles  
Use your task checklist for lightweight tracking of to-do lists. If you find that you don't use this feature, you can disable it from the [common configurations dialog](../customize/customize-cards.md#annotations). 

You can also [add tags and show tags and fields on cards](../customize/customize-cards.md) to support other tracking needs.  

In addition, you can:
