# Definition of Done

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015**

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2015"
As your team updates the status of work as it progresses from one stage to the next, it helps that they agree on what "done" means. By specifying the Definition of Done criteria for each Kanban column, you help share the essential tasks to complete before moving an item into a downstream stage. 

Also, you'll have implemented one of the core Kanban tenets: **make processes and policies explicit.**

When set, team members can quickly double-check the done criteria.

## Specify the Definition of Done for a column

1. From your Kanban board, click ![settings icon](../_img/icons/team-settings-gear-icon.png) and as needed, click Columns.  

	![Kanban board, open common configuration settings](../customize/_img/customize-cards/open-config-dialog.png)

	If you're not a team administrator, [get added as one](../scale/add-team-administrator.md). Only team or project administrators can customize the Kanban board.

2. Open the Definition of Done for the column that applies to the criteria you'll enter. You can specify the Definition of Done for each intermediate column on your team's Kanban board.

3. 	Click a column tab and enter the Definition of Done for that column. Enter text that defines your [team's Definition of Done](#definition-of-done).
