# Add a team administrator 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

It's always a good idea to have more than one person with administration permissions for an area. You need to be a team administrator to [configure team settings](manage-team-assets.md). 

As a team administrator, you can configure, customize, and manage all team-related activities for your team. These include being able to add team members, add team admins, and configure Agile tools and team assets.

## Prerequisites

::: moniker range="vsts"
* You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [VSTS](../../accounts/set-up-vs.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../../accounts/add-account-users-assign-access-levels.md). 
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"
* You must be a member of a team project. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in an [on-premises TFS](../../accounts/create-team-project.md). If you haven't been added as a team member, [get added now](../../security/add-users-team-project.md). 
::: moniker-end
* To get added as a team administrator, ask another team admin, the account owner, or a member of the [Project Administrators group](../../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md) to add you.  

If you need to add a team, see [Add teams and team members](multiple-teams.md).
