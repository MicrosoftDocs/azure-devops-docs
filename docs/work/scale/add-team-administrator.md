# Add a team administrator 

<b>VSTS | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013</b> 


<a id="add-team-admin">  </a>  

It's always a good idea to have more than one person with administration permissions for an area. You need to be a team administrator to [configure team settings](manage-team-assets.md). 

As a team administrator, you can configure, customize, and manage all team-related activities for your team. These include being able to add team members, add team admins, and configure Agile tools and team assets. 

To get added as a team administrator, ask another team admin or the account owner or project administrator to add you.  
 
1. From a web browser, open the team admin context. Click the ![gear icon](../_img/icons/gear_icon.png) gear icon from your team home page.  
 
2. Click the **Add** link to open the dialog for adding user identities.
