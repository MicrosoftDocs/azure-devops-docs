## Support a growing organization, manage work across the enterprise

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

How do you manage work across the enterprise using Agile tools?  How will you scale your Agile tools to support your growing enterprise?  

When you connect to VSTSor an on-premises TFS, you connect to an account or team project collection. Within that collection, one or more team projects may be defined. At a minimum, at least one team project must be created in order to use the system.

When you create your team project, a team of the same name is automatically created. For small teams, this is sufficient.  

However, for enterprise-level organizations, it may be necessary to scale up, to create additional teams and/or team projects. These can be created within the single account or collection.

You can scale your system as needed by adding teams and/or team projects. These can be created within the single account or collection. As your organization grows, your tools can grow to support a [culture of team autonomy as well as organizational alignment](agile-culture.md).
