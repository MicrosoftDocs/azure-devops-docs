# About area and iteration paths (aka sprints) 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Area paths allow you to group work items by team, product, or feature area. Whereas, iteration paths allow you to group work into sprints, milestones, or other event-specific or time-related period. Both these fields allow you to define a hierarchy of paths. 

You define area and iteration paths for a team project. Teams can then choose which paths are used to support their backlog and other Agile tools. To understand how Agile tools use area and iteration paths, see [Agile tools that rely on areas and iterations](../../settings/about-teams-and-settings.md).

The areas and iterations you see depend on the process you used to create your team project. Here we show the defaults defined for the Scrum process. No dates are set. You set dates to correspond to your sprint or release schedules.

## How many areas should a team define?

You add areas to support your team's trace-ability and security requirements. Use areas to represent logical or physical components, and then create child areas to represent specific features.  

Add areas when you have these requirements: 
*	Filter queries based on a product or feature area 
*	Organize or group work items by team or sub-teams  
*	Restrict access to work items based on their area.  

Each team can create a hierarchy of areas under which the team can organize their backlog items, user stories, requirements, tasks, and bugs.

Avoid creating an area structure that is too complex. You can create areas to partition permissions on work items, but complex trees require significant overhead for permission management. You might find that it is too much work to duplicate the structure and permissions in other team projects.

## How many iterations should a team define?

You define as many child iterations as you need to reflect your project lifecycle. These paths represent a series of events, such as sprints, pre-beta and beta deliverables, and other release milestones. Teams typically leave work items assigned to the team's default iteration if they are not yet scheduled for work or for a release.  

Add iterations to support these requirements:  
* Define sprints your Scrum teams use to [plan and execute their sprints](../scrum/sprint-planning.md)
* Set up more complex multi-release and sprint cycles
* Filter queries based on sprints, milestones, or cycle time for your project 
* Support future work that you're not ready to assign to a target release cycle.  

In the following example, Backlog, Beta 1, Beta 2, Release 1.0, and Release 2.0 are defined for the MyApplication team project.

As you create the backlog of product features and tasks, you can start to assign them to the milestones by which you expect the team to finish the features and tasks.
As your needs change, you can add events under each major milestone that reflect how your team schedules and manages its work.  

As the following example shows, the Beta 1 iteration now contains three child nodes, one for each sprint in the Beta 1 time period.

Iterations do not enforce any rules. For example, you can assign a task to an iteration but not close or complete it during that iteration. At the end of an iteration, you should find all work items that remain active or have not been closed for that iteration and take appropriate action. You can, for example, move them to a different iteration or return them to the backlog.

## Naming restrictions 

The **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** fields, [data type=TreePath](reference/define-modify-work-item-fields.md), consist of multiple node items which are separated by the backslash (&#92;) character. We recommend that you minimize the names of nodes, and make sure that you conform to the following restrictions when adding child nodes:

> [!div class="mx-tdCol2BreakAll"]
> | Restriction type                 | Restriction                                 | 
> | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | 
> | Node length | Must not contain more than 255 characters | 
> | Special characters for nodes | Must not contain Unicode control characters<br/>Must not contain any of the following characters: \ / $ ? * : " & < # % + <br/>Must not contain characters that the [local file system prohibits](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa365247.aspx). |
> | Reserved names | Must contain more than a period (.) or two periods (..)<br/>Must not be a [system-reserved name](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa365247.aspx) such as PRN, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, COM10, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9, NUL, CON, or AUX<br/>| 
> | Path length | Must contain fewer than 4,000 Unicode characters | 
> | Path hierarchy depth | Must be fewer than 14 levels deep |

### Export tree structures  

You can't export the structure of tree paths for one team project to use with another team project.

### Supported field rules  

You can [specify only a small subset of rules](reference/apply-rule-work-item-field.md#system), such as ```HELPTEXT``` and ```READONLY``` to System.XXX fields.

### Team field versus team area path  
If your organization has several teams that work from a common backlog and across many product areas, you might want to change how teams are configured. By [adding a custom field to represent teams](use-team-fields-instead-area-paths.md) in your organization, you can reconfigure the agile planning tools and pages to support your teams and decouple assignment to teams and area paths.
