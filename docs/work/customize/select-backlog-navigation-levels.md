# Select backlog navigation levels for your team

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015**

Each team can determine the backlog levels that they use. For example, feature teams may want to only focus on their product backlog, while a management team may choose to only show feature and epics (the two default portfolio backlogs). You configure which backlog levels appear from your team settings dialog. 

::: moniker range="vsts" 
If you want additional portfolio backlogs, see the following topics based on the process model you use: 
- **Inheritance**: [Customize your backlogs or boards for a process](process/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md)  
- **Hosted XML**: [Add portfolio backlogs](add-portfolio-backlogs.md).  

For an overview of process models, see [Customize your work tracking experience](customize-work.md).

::: moniker range="tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018" 
If you want additional portfolio backlogs, see [Add portfolio backlogs](add-portfolio-backlogs.md).

> [!NOTE]    
> **Feature availability**: The team setting for choosing which backlog levels are available is available from TFS 2015 and later versions. For TFS 2013, the Feature portfolio backlog level is enabled for all teams.

## Set your team's preferences for backlog levels

Because this setting affects all team members' view of the team backlogs and boards, you must be a team administrator to change the setting. Changing the setting is disabled if you're not a team administrator. Go [here to get added as a team administrator](../scale/add-team-administrator.md).
