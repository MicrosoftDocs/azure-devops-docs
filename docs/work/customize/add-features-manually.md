# Add updates to team projects manually  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-header-tfs-only.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>This topic applies only to team projects defined on an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS). Team projects hosted on VSTS [update automatically with each service upgrade](/vsts/release-notes/index). 
>
>For an overview of customization options, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../customize/customize-work.md)

You can update team projects that were created in earlier versions of Team Foundation Server (TFS) to use new features added with the upgrade to TFS. You should update team projects by using the [Configure Features wizard](configure-features-after-upgrade.md). However, if the wizard is unable to add a feature, you can add it manually.  

> [!NOTE]     
>If you're upgrading a team project that was based on a Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) version 4.2 process template, follow the procedures provided in [Update a team project based on a MSF v4.2 process template](reference/update-a-team-project-v4-dot-2-process-template.md). If you have several team projects you need to update, see [apply updates programmatically](configure-features-after-upgrade.md#program-updates).


## Update a team project 
Prior to manually adding or editing a work tracking object, first [download the latest process template](#download-latest-pt). You'll use the definition files from the process template that most closely matches your existing team project. 

Several features, such as Code Review and Feedback, simply require importing WITs from the process template that you download, and updating the Categories and ProcessConfiguration file. Other features, however, may require more extensive changes depending on the customizations you've made to your team project.  

> [!NOTE]    
>Follow the links for each step to detail procedures provide later in this topic.

## Get the latest version of the most compatible process template  

The quickest way to make many of these updates is to copy definition files from the latest process template and import them to your team project.   

1.	Open the same version of Visual Studio or Team Explorer as the on-premises TFS that you connect to. For example, if you connect to a TFS 2015 instance, you must connect from Visual Studio 2015 or Team Explorer 2015.  
	You can always download a free version of Team Explorer from the [Visual Studio download site](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs).

	If you aren't a member of the Project Collection Administrators group, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd547204(v=vs.140).aspx">get added as one</a>. 

2.	Open the Process Template Manager from the **Team, Team Project Collection Settings** menu. 

	 ![Open Process Template Manager](../work-items/guidance/_img/open-process-template-manager.png)

	You'll see a list of each process template that has been uploaded to the team project collection.  

	 ![Select process template to work with](../work-items/guidance/_img/process-template-manager.png)

	The **Upload**, **Download**, **Make Default**, and **Delete** buttons are disabled when you don't have the necessary permissions to manage process templates. 
 
3.	Download the process template to a local computer, select a folder where the process template will be downloaded. 

	Choose the process that corresponds to the one you used previously to create your team project. For example, if you're updating a team project based on the Scrum process template, then select **Scrum**. Note that all version numbers have been removed from the process templates. If you don't see Agile, CMMI, or Scrum, then you need to [update TFS](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs). 
 
You can determine which process template to select based on the [work item types defined for your existing team project](../work-items/guidance/manage-process-templates.md#wit_correlation).

To learn more about managing process templates, see, [Upload or download a process template](../work-items/guidance/manage-process-templates.md).

## Import a WIT 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/witadmin-run-tool-example.md)]	

0.	Enter the ```witadmin importwitd``` command, substituting your data for the arguments that are shown.   

	```witadmin importwitd /collection:CollectionURL /p:"ProjectName" /f:"DirectoryPath\WITDefinitionFile.xml"```

		For *CollectionURL* specify the URL of a team project collection and for *ProjectName* specify the name of a team project defined within the collection. You must specify the URL in the following format: ```http://ServerName:Port/VirtualDirectoryName/CollectionName```.  

		For *DirectoryPath*, specify the path to the ```WorkItem Tracking/TypeDefinitions``` folder that holds the process template that you downloaded. The directory path must follow this structure: ```Drive:\TemplateFolder\WorkItem Tracking\TypeDefinitions```.

	For  example,  import the Feedback Request WIT:

	```witadmin importwitd /collection:"http://MyServer:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection"/p:MyProject /f:"C:\MyTemplates\WorkItem Tracking\TypeDefinitions\FeedbackRequest.xml"``` 

Here's a checklist of WITs to import to support new features:   
-	**Portfolio Backlogs**: Epic and Feature
-	**Code Review**: Code Review Request and Code Review Response
-	**Feedback**: Feedback Request and Feedback Response 
-	**Shared Parameters**: Shared Parameters
-	**Test Plan and Test Suite**:  Test Plan and Test Suite

## Edit a WIT  
Depending on the customizations that you've made and the features you want to enable, you may need to update one or more WIT definition files. If you haven't customized a WIT, simply import the latest version. Otherwise, you can copy XML syntax from the WIT files you've downloaded from the latest process template. 

1.	Export the WITs that you have defined for the corresponding category.  

	```witadmin exportwitd /collection:CollectionURL /p:ProjectName /n:TypeName [/f:FileName]```

2.	Make the updates required to support your team project and add new features.  
	
	Here's a checklist of updates to make:

</table>
<sup>1</sup>  Don't add the Backlog Priority or Stack Rank fields to the ```FORM``` section. These fields support ordering of backlog items and aren't meant to be set manually. 

3.	Import your WIT file.  
	```witadmin importwitd /collection:CollectionURL [/p:Project] /f:FileName "```  



<a id="update-categories">   </a>  

## Update Categories  

> [!TIP]  
> See also [Use categories to group work items](reference/use-categories-to-group-work-item-types.md) and [Import and export categories](reference/witadmin/witadmin-import-export-categories.md).  

1.	Export your categories file. 

	```witadmin exportcategories /collection:CollectionURL /p:ProjectName /f:"DirectoryPath\categories.xml"```

	If you don't have a categories file, then copy the one from a default process template. Categories were introduced with TFS 2012 to more easily manage multiple work item types (WITs) as a group. 

2.	Make the updates required to support your team project and add new features. 
	Here's a checklist of categories to import to add or verify to support new features:   

	-	**Code Review**: Code Review Request Category and Code Review Response Category
	-	**Feedback**: Feedback Request Category and Feedback Response Category
	-	**Planning Tools**: Requirement Category, Task Category, Bug Category, and Hidden Types Category
	-	**Shared Parameters**: Shared Parameters Category
	-	**Portfolio Backlogs**: Epic Category and Feature Category
	-	**Test Plan and Test Suite**:  Test Plan Category and Test Suite Category 

	If you use custom WITs to support requirements or tasks, then you'll want to add or modify the Requirement Category and Task Category. For example, Fabrikam Fiber uses the following definitions to support their requirement tracking: 
```
	 <CATEGORY name="Requirement Category" refname="Microsoft.RequirementCategory">
	    <DEFAULTWORKITEMTYPE name="Customer App" />
	    <WORKITEMTYPE name="Service App" />
	 </CATEGORY>
```

3.	Import your categories file.
 
	```witadmin importcategories /collection:CollectionURL /p:ProjectName /f:"DirectoryPath\categories.xml"```

<a id="edit-processconfig">   </a>

## Update ProcessConfiguration 

Agile planning tools and Portfolio Backlogs depend on the WITs, categories, and process configuration definitions that are made. These definitions are interdependent. Always add new WITs, update categories, and then update the ProcessConfiguration in that order.  

<ol>
<li>Export your ProcessConfiguration file. <br/>

```witadmin exportprocessconfig /collection:CollectionURL /p:ProjectName /f:FileName```<br/>

<p>If you don't have a ProcessConfiguration file, then copy the one from a default process template. ProcessConfiguration was introduced with TFS 2013 and replaced the CommonConfiguration and AgileConfiguration files.</p>
</li>
<li>Make the updates required to support your team project and add new features. If you've customized the workflow for WITs defined in the Requirement, Task, Bug, Epic, or Feature categories, review [Process configuration, Map workflow states to metastates](reference/process-configuration-xml-element.md#map).  <br/>

<p>Here's a checklist of updates to make:</p>

<li>Map each intermediate workflow state you want to have show up on the Kanban board to ```type="InProgress"``` </li>
<li>Map the end of each workflow state to ```type="Complete"``` </li>

## Migrate existing test plans and suites

Migrate existing test plans and suites to work item based test plans and suites.  

1.	Open a Command Prompt window on the TFS application-tier server. For example:   
	```cd %programfiles%\TFS 14.0\Tools```

2.	Run the ```TfsConfig TCM``` command.
	```TFSConfig TCM /upgradeTestPlans /CollectionName:CollectionName /TeamProject:TeamProjectName```

	For example:

	```TFSConfig TCM /upgradeTestPlans /CollectionName:"Fabrikam Fiber Collection" /TeamProject:"Fabrikam Fiber"```

3.	Respond to the questions that appear.
	```

	In order to upgrade the test plans, you have to complete the following steps:
	1. Import the test plan work item definition into the project. Have you complete
	d this step? (Yes/No) Yes
	2. Import the test plan category into the project. Have you completed this step?
	(Yes/No) Yes
	
	Test plan migration job successfully scheduled.
	```
4.	If you're migrating a large quantity of test plans and test suites, you can run the following command to monitor the progress of data migration.

	```TFSConfig TCM /upgradeStatus /collectionName:CollectionName /TeamProject:TeamProjectName```

After a successful data migration, all test management data should be available for use. For more information about this utility, go here.

## Review and verify access to new features
After you update your team project manually, you have access to the latest features. However, you still might want to make some additional configurations or customizations to support your work tracking needs. 

See [Additional configuration options](additional-configuration-options.md) for information on how to verify or activate each feature.
