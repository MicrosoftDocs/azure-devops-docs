# TF30277: You do not have sufficient permissions on the Windows SharePoint Services at {0} to create a new site

[!INCLUDE [temp](../../../_shared/dev15-version-header.md)]

This error occurs when the permissions granted your user account on the Windows SharePoint Services server {*name*} are not sufficient to allow you to create the new SharePoint Services site. A SharePoint site is used as the project portal. You must be granted specific permission by the Windows SharePoint Services administrator.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
Contact the administrator for the Windows SharePoint Services server {*name*} and ask that your user account be added to the Site Administrator group. Your Team Foundation Server administrator may also be able to grant you the required permission.
