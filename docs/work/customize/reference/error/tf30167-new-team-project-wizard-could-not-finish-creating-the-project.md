# TF30167: The New Team Project Wizard could not finish creating the project {0}.
[!INCLUDE [temp](../../../_shared/dev15-version-header.md)]

The New Team Project Wizard encountered an unexpected error while creating the team project {*name*}. This problem can occur when the wizard uses a third-party plug-in while creating the team project, and the third-party plug-in encounters a critical error such as a stack overflow or running out of memory.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Restart Team Explorer and run the New Team Project Wizard again.  
  
2.  If the problem persists, contact your Team Foundation Server administrator.
