# Reportable fields reference for Visual Studio ALM


> [!IMPORTANT]  
>This topic applies to team project customization for On-premises XML process models. For you to view reports, you must have configured your TFS and team project to support reporting. See [Add reports to a team project](../../../report/admin/add-reports-to-a-team-project.md). 
>
>For an overview of process models and customization options, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../customize-work.md). 


A default set of fields appears in the relational warehouse database or the cube. The following tables list those reportable fields defined in the default process templates provided with the current release of Team Foundation Server. These fields have a `reportable` attribute value of `Detail`, `Dimension`, or `Measure`. See [Add or modify work item fields to support reporting](add-or-modify-work-item-fields-to-support-reporting.md).  
  
 For a complete list of fields that are defined in the default process templates, see [Work item field index](../../work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).
