# Manage issues or impediments 

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

<a name="manage-impediments"></a>

If you have known issues you want to track, you can do so by defining an impediment (Scrum) or issue (Agile or CMMI). Impediments and issues represent unplanned activities. Resolving them requires more work beyond what's tracked for actual requirements. Using the impediment work item type helps you track and manage these issues until you can resolve and close them. 

Don't confuse impediments with bugs. You track impediments that may cause problems with delivering one or more requirements. For example, you may have to address feature ambiguity, personnel or resource issues, problems with environments, or other risks that impact scope, quality, or schedule. Other issues that deserve tracking are decisions that require several stakeholders or product teams to weigh in on.

In this topic you'll learn:

::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
<!---#### VSTS, TFS 2018, TFS 2017 (new form enabled) --> 
From the **Work** hub, choose Impediment from the New Work Item list of options. Click the ![pin icon](../_img/icons/pin-icon.png) pin icon to have it show up within the Work hub drop down menu.

<!--- Or, from the Queries page, you can add a new work item.

## Customize issues tracking

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/customize-work-tracking.md)] 
::: moniker range="vsts"
Impediments and issues don't appear on your backlog. Instead, you track them using [queries](../track/using-queries.md). If you want them to appear on your backlog, or you want to track other work item types on your backlog, see [Customize your backlogs or boards](../customize/process/customize-process-backlogs-boards.md).

If you want them to appear on your backlog, or you want to track other work item types on your backlog, see [Add a work item type to a backlog and board](../customize/add-wits-to-backlogs-and-boards.md).
