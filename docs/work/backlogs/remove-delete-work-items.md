# Move, change, or delete work items 

**VSTS**

Often times you find that someone created a work item of the wrong work item type (WIT) or within an incorrect team project. You can correct these issues for individual work items or bulk modify several work items. You can also remove work items added to your backlog or task board that aren't relevant anymore.  

::: moniker-end

# Delete or restore work items 

**TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013**

You can remove work items added to your backlog or task board that aren't relevant anymore. Simply change the State to Remove, or delete the work item. You can perform  operations on individual work items or bulk modify several work items. 

> [!TIP]    
You can't change the work item type for an existing work item, but you can [copy the work item and specify a new type](copy-clone-work-items.md#copy-clone). Also, if you have several work items with type changes you want to make, you can [export them using Excel](office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md), and then re-add them as a new type.

You only have access to those actions that are supported on your platform and for which you have permissions. If you are a member of the Contributors group (anyone who has been added as a team member) or Project Administrators groups, you have access to the following features. For a simplified view of permissions assigned to built-in groups, see [Permissions and access](../../security/permissions-access.md).

## Prerequisites  
  
* To change the work item type, delete, or remove work items, you must be a member of the Contributors group or be granted [Stakeholder access](/vsts/security/get-started-stakeholder) 
	Or, you must have your **View work items in this node**, and your **Edit work items in this node** permissions set to **Allow** 
* To move work items to another team project, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group or have the **Move work items out of this project** permission set to Allow. The Contributors group does not have this permission set at the project-level by default.
* To delete work items, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group or have the **Delete work items in this project** permission set to Allow. The Contributors group has **Delete and restore work items** at the project-level set to **Allow** by default.

<a id="change-type"> </a>  
## Change the work item type 

> [!NOTE]  
>You can't change the work item type of work items associated with test management. Both Contributors and users assigned Stakeholder access can change the work item type.       

Changing the work item type refreshes the work item form with the fields defined for the type selected. For example, you can change a bug to a task and the form will refresh with the fields defined for a task. 

You can change a single work item or several [multi-selected work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md) to a new type. 


1. Select the ![Change team project icon](../_img/icons/change-type-icon.png) Change type... option from the work item form's ![Action icon](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) Actions menu.    

	![Work item form, Change work item type menu option](_img/move-change-delete/change-work-item-type.png)  

	Or, from the backlog or query results page, multi-select several work items whose type you want to change. You can select several work items of the same type or different type so long as you want to change them all to the same work item type. 

	Click ![actions icon](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) to open the context menu of one of the selected work items, and choose the ![Change team project icon](../_img/icons/change-type-icon.png) **Change type&hellip;** option.    

	> [!IMPORTANT]   
	>From the Query results page, the **Change type&hellip;** option becomes unavailable if you have checked the Query Editor's **Query across projects** checkbox. 

	![VSTS, backlog, multi-select, open menu, choose Change type option](_img/move-change-delete/change-work-item-type-from-backlog.png)  

2. Select the type and optionally enter a comment.  

	![VSTS, Change work item type dialog](_img/move-change-delete/change-work-item-type-dialog.png)    

	Comments are automatically added to the [Discussion control](../work-items/work-item-form-controls.md#discussion). 

3. Save the work item to complete the change.  
 
	> [!NOTE]     
	> The system automatically resets the State and Reason fields to the default initial values of the specified type.  

4. From the Query results page, you must save all work items that you bulk-modified. When you bulk modify items from the backlog, they are automatically saved. Work items shown in bold text indicate that local changes have not yet been saved to the data store. The system automatically saves each work item. Refresh the page to reflect your changes.

<a id="move"> </a>  
## Move a work item to another team project  

When you discover that a work item belongs to a different team project within your account or collection, you can move it where it belongs. You can move a single work item or several [multi-selected work items](bulk-modify-work-items.md). 

<!---
Feature availability: The **Move to team project&hellip;** menu option is supported only from VSTS.
-->  

You can only move work items from one team project to another team project within the account or collection. You can't move work items associated with test management. To move work items to another team project, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group or be [granted explicit permissions to move work items](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions).

1. Open the work item and choose the ![Move work item icon](../_img/icons/change-team-project-icon.png) **Move...** option from the work item form's ![Action icon](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) Actions menu.    

	If you don't see the option, then you haven't been granted [permissions to move work items out of the project](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions).  

	Or, from the backlog or query results page, multi-select several work items whose type you want to change. You can select several work items of the same type or different type so long as you want to change them all to the same work item type. 

	Click ![actions icon](../_img/icons/actions-icon.png) to open the context menu of one of the selected work items, and choose the ![Move work item icon](../_img/icons/change-team-project-icon.png) **Move&hellip;** option. 

2. Select the destination team project and optionally enter a comment.  

	![VSTS, Move work item type dialog](_img/move-change-delete/move-work-item-dialog.png)
  
	Comments are automatically added to the [Discussion control](../work-items/work-item-form-controls.md#discussion) and an entry is made to the History control. Also, the system automatically resets the State and Reason fields to the default initial values for the work item type that you move.  

::: moniker-end


<a id="remove"> </a>  
## Remove work items by changing the State

By changing the State of a work item to Removed, you effectively remove it from a backlog or board view (product, portfolio, and sprint backlogs, Kanban board, and task boards).

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![VSTS, Change State to Removed](_img/move-change-delete/remove-state.png)  


To cause removed items to not show up in queries, you must add a clause that indicates which states you want the query to filter for.

## Delete work items  
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> The Delete and Recycle bin features are available from TFS 2015.2 and later versions. 
::: moniker-end
::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2015 <= tfs-2018"
Deleted work items won't appear in your backlogs, boards, or queries. Deleted items are moved to a recycle bin from which you can recover them if needed. To delete a test case, test plan, or test suite, or other test-related WITS, see [Delete test artifacts](#delete-test). 

1. You can delete a work item from within the work item form, or by multi-selecting work items from a backlog or query results page.   

2. Confirm you want to actually delete the item(s).  

	![Confirm delete dialog](_img/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-dialog.png)

3. Using multi-select from a backlog or query results list, you can delete several work items at once. 

4. You can also delete work items from your Kanban or task board. 
 
	![Delete work item from Kanban board](_img/move-change-delete/delete-work-items-from-kanban-board.png)

	Or, you can drag them to the ![Recycle bin](_img/recycle-bin-icon.png) (Recycle bin). You can only access the (Recycle bin) from the Work hub.

## Restore or permanently delete work items   

To permanently delete work items from the web portal, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group or be [granted explicit permissions to delete or restore work items](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions).

# [Browser](#tab/browser)

::: moniker range="tfs-2013"
Restoring or deleting work items from the web portal isn't a supported feature for TFS 2013. 
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="tfs-2015"
> [!NOTE]  
> **Feature availability**: The Delete and Recycle bin features require TFS 2015.2 or later version.  
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="vsts || >= tfs-2017 <= tfs-2018"
1. To restore deleted items, open the Recycle bin from the web portal.  
 
	![Open Recycle bin](_img/move-change-delete/open-recycle-bin.png)

2.	Select the items you want to restore  and then choose **Restore**.  
 
	![Restore selected items](_img/move-change-delete/restore-from-recycle-bin.png) 

	Optionally, you can choose to permanently delete the items.

	> [!NOTE] 
	>You'll only see the Permanently delete option if your [Permanently delete work items permission](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions) is set to Allow.  

3.	Confirm your selection.

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

::: moniker range="vsts"
Deleting work items from the command line isn't a supported feature for VSTS
::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"
<a id="perm-delete"> </a>    

Use the ```witadmin destroywi``` command to permanently remove work items from the data store. A permanent delete means all information in the WIT data store is deleted and cannot be restored nor reactivated. You must be a member of the Project Administrators group of have your **Edit project-level information** permission set to Allow. 

1. Open a Command Prompt window where the latest version of Visual Studio is installed and change the directory to where the **witadmin.exe** tool has been installed. For example, you would change to the following directory for TFS 2017. (For other versions, see [Remove work items permanently (witadmin destroywi)](../customize/reference/witadmin/remove-work-items-permanently.md)).  
	::: moniker range=">= tfs-2017"  
	`%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\TeamFoundation\Team Explorer`  
	::: moniker-end  
	::: moniker range="tfs-2015"  
	`cd %programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Common7\IDE` 

	> [!NOTE] 
	>**Required permissions:** For TFS 2015.2 or later versions, you must have [Permanently delete work items permission set to Allow](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#move-delete-permissions). For TFS 2015.1 or earlier versions, you must be a member of the Project Administrators group of have Edit project-level information permissions set to Allow. 	
	::: moniker-end  
	::: moniker range="tfs-2013"  
	`cd %programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE` 
	::: moniker-end  
	On a 32-bit edition of Windows, replace %programfiles(x86)% with %programfiles%.      

	The **witadmin** command-line tool installs with any version of Visual Studio or Team Explorer. You can access this tool by installing the [free version of Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).  

2.	To delete several work items, enter the server name and directory path to the collection. For example:   

	```witadmin destroywi /collection:http://TFSServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /id:12,15,23```
 
	To delete a single work item, simply enter the ID as shown:  

	```witadmin destroywi /collection:http://TFSServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection /id:2003```

## Delete test artifacts  

You must be a member of the Project Administrators group or have the [**Delete test artifacts** permission set to **Allow**](../../security/set-permissions-access-work-tracking.md#delete-test-permissions). You must also have your [access level set to Advanced](../../security/change-access-levels.md), which provides access to the full Test feature set. Users with Basic access and with permissions to permanently delete work items and manage test artifacts can only delete orphaned test cases. That is, they can delete test cases created from the work hub that aren't linked to any test plans or test suites. 

To delete test artifacts, the following restrictions and operations apply:  
- Users with Basic access and with permissions to permanently delete work items and manage test artifacts can only delete orphaned test cases. That is, they can delete test cases created from the work hub that aren't linked to any test plans or test suites.  
- When you delete a test plan, test suite, test case, shared steps, or shared parameters, you not only permanently delete them, you also delete all associated test artifacts such as test results.  
- You can't bulk delete test artifacts. If test artifacts are part of a bulk selection to be deleted, all other work items except the test artifact(s) will get deleted.
::: moniker-end

>We only support permanent deletion of test artifacts such as test plans, test suites, test cases, shared steps and shared parameters. Deleted test artifacts won't appear in the recycle bin and cannot be restored. Deletion of test artifacts not only deletes the selected test artifact but also all its associated child items such as child test suites, test points across all configurations, testers (the underlying test case work item doesn't get deleted), test results history, and other associated history.

2. Confirm you want to actually delete the item.  
  
	![Confirm delete of test artifacts](_img/move-change-delete/perm-delete-test-artifacts-dialog.png)  
 
3. You can also delete test plans and test suites directly from the Test hub. 

	![Delete test plans and artifacts from Test hub](_img/move-change-delete/delete-test-plans.png)  

4.	To delete shared steps and shared parameters you need to first manually remove all references to them before you can delete them.

### Delete and restore actions performed under the hood  

#### Delete work items 
When you delete a work item, the following actions occur:  

- Generates a new revision of the work item  
- Updates the Changed By/Changed Date fields to support traceability  
- Preserves the work item completely, including all field assignments, attachments, tags, and links  
- Causes work item to become non-queryable and therefore can't appear in any work tracking experience, query result, or report  
- Updates charts accordingly, CFD, velocity, burndown and lightweight charts are updated to remove deleted work items  
- Removes WIT extensions  
- Preserves trend data except for the latest value 
- Removes the work item from the data warehouse/cube similar to as if it was permanently removed.  

#### Restore work items
When you restore a work item, the following actions occur:   

- Causes a new revision of the work item to be made  
- Updates the Changed By/Changed Date fields to support traceability   
- Becomes queryable  
- All fields remain unchanged  
- History contains 2 new revisions, one for deletion, and one for restore  
- Reattaches WIT extensions   
- Updates charts accordingly, CFD, velocity, burndown and lightweight charts are updated to include the restored work items  
- Restores trend data  
- Adds the work item back to the data warehouse/cube similar  
- Sets the area or iteration path fields to the root node if the previous area path or iteration paths were deleted.

#### Delete test artifacts
1.	Removes the deleted test artifact from the test case management (TCM) data store and deletes the underlying work item
2.	Runs a job to delete all the child items both from the TCM side and the underlying work items. This action may take time (up to a few minutes) depending on the number of artifacts to be deleted. 
3.	Causes all information in the WIT data store and TCM data store to be deleted and cannot be reactivated nor restored.
