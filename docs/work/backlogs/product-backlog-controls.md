# Product backlog controls  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Once you've defined your product backlog, you can use the following controls to change or filter the view. 

| Control                  | Function                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Backlog  | [Switch to backlog view](create-your-backlog.md)    |
| Board    | [Switch to Kanban board view](../kanban/kanban-quickstart.md)  |
| Forecast | [Turn forecasting Off/On](../scrum/forecast.md) |
| Mapping | [Turn mapping Off/On](organize-backlog.md)   |
| Parents | [Show/Hide parents](organize-backlog.md) |
| In progress items | [Show/Hide in progress items](../scrum/forecast.md)   |
| ![Settings icon](../_img/icons/team-settings-gear-icon.png)    | [Configure team settings](../scale/manage-team-assets.md#team-settings)  |
| ![full screen icon](../_img/icons/fullscreen_icon.png) / ![exit full screen icon](../_img/icons/exitfullscreen_icon.png)     | Enter or exit full screen mode      |
| ![expand icon](../_img/icons/expand_icon.png) / ![collapse icon](../_img/icons/collapse_icon.png)   | Expand or collapse one level of the tree hierarchy    |
| ![mail icon](../_img/icons/mail_icon.png)  | Email a copy of your backlog      |
| ![Filter](../_img/icons/tag_filter_icon.png)  | [Turn tag filtering On/Off ](../track/add-tags-to-work-items.md)  |  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you set the **In progress** control to **Hide**, then items that are no longer in the New, Approved, or Proposed states won't appear in the backlog. 

Even if you have show parents turned on, the **Create query** and mail ![mail icon](../_img/icons/mail_icon.png) controls will only list items at the currently selected level.
