# Get started with Agile tools to plan and track work     

[!INCLUDE [temp](./_shared/dev15-version-header.md)] 

Agile tools support the core Agile methods&mdash;Scrum and Kanban&mdash;used by software development teams today. Scrum tools support defining and managing work within sprints, setting capacity, and tracking tasks. Kanban tools allow you to manage a continuous flow of work via an interactive sign board.  

>[!NOTE]
>Working from the web portal, you have several backlogs and boards available to support planning and tracking work. For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](backlogs-boards-plans.md). 

You access all Agile tools from the **Work** hub. If you're new to Agile, see [What is Agile?](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-agile/) for an overview.

## Agile project management basics 

You build your project plan by creating a backlog of work items that represent the features, requirements, user stories, or other work to perform.  Different types of work items help you track different types of work, such as user stories, tasks, bugs, issues, and more. 

[![Define stories](_img/gs-planning-define-stories.png)](./backlogs/create-your-backlog.md)[![Organize backlog](_img/gs-planning-organize-backlog.png)](./backlogs/organize-backlog.md)[![Manage bugs](_img/gs-planning-manage-bugs.png)](./backlogs/manage-bugs.md)[![Manage issues](_img/gs-planning-manage-issues.png)](./backlogs/create-your-backlog.md#manage-impediments)


## Scrum method and tools 
The Scrum method uses sprints to plan work to perform by a team within a specific time period and cadence. To get started, several sprints are predefined for your team.  If you're new to Scrum, get an overview from [What is Scrum?](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-scrum/). 

[![Schedule sprints](_img/gs-planning-define-sprints.png)](./scrum/define-sprints.md)[![Plan a sprint](_img/gs-planning-plan-sprint.png)](./scrum/sprint-planning.md)[![Monitor sprint progress](_img/gs-planning-monitor-sprint.png)](./scrum/task-board.md)[![Forecast](_img/gs-planning-forecast.png)](./scrum/velocity-and-forecasting.md)


## Kanban method and tools
Kanban uses a visual interactive board to plan and show progress using cards. Your Kanban board is fully customizable to support the workflow used by your team.  

[![Configure Kanban board](_img/gs-planning-configure-kanban.png)](./kanban/kanban-basics.md)[![Update the Kanban board](_img/gs-planning-track-kanban.png)](./kanban/kanban-basics.md)[![Monitor progress](_img/gs-planning-monitor-kanban.png)](../Report/guidance/cumulative-flow.md)

You update the status of work by dragging card to another column on the Kanban board. You can even change the order of items as you move a card to a new column.

## Try this next  

Once you've started tracking work, you'll want to monitor and track progress, identify trends, and share your plans. See [Get started monitoring progress and trends with Agile tools](../report/monitor-progress-trends.md). 

Take these tools for a test run by [creating an account on Team Services for free](../setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services.md).
