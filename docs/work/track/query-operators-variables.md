# Query fields, operators, and macros

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)] 

You find and create lists of work items by creating work item queries. By defining one or more clauses, you filter from all work items within a team project or team project collection to return the set of work items that interest you. For each clause, you specify a field, an operator, and a value or variable.  

For example, you can search for all work items assigned to you by specifying the **Assigned To** field, the equals (=) operator, and the as **@Me** variable which represents your user account.

**Sample query clause**

<table>
<tr>
	<th>And/Or</th>
	<th>Field</th>
	<th>Operator</th>
	<th>Value</th></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><strong>And</strong></p></td>
	<td><p><strong>Assigned To</strong></p></td>
	<td><p><strong>=</strong></p></td>
	<td><p><strong>&#64;Me</strong></p></td>
</tr>
</table>


For more general information about queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](using-queries.md). 

**Checklist for how to define a query clause:**  

1.  In the first empty row, under the **Field** column heading, choose the down arrow to display the list of available fields, and choose an item in the list.

    For more information, see [Query Fields and Values](#fields-values).

2.  In the same row, under the **Operator** column heading, choose the down arrow to display the list of available operators, and choose an item in the list.

    For more information, see [Operators](#operators).

3.  In the same row, under the **Value** column heading, either type a value, or choose the down arrow, and choose an item in the list.

    For more information about how to use variables to specify the current team project, user, or date, see [Variables](#variables).

5.  To add a clause, choose **Click here to add a new clause** or **Add a new clause**.

    You can add a clause to the end of the query, insert a clause after an existing clause (![](_img/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588311.png)), and remove (![](_img/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588312.png)), group (![](_img/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588313.png)), and ungroup (![](_img/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC588314.png)) clauses as needed.

<a id="and-or" /> 
## And/Or

You specify **And** or **Or** to create logical expressions of your query clauses. Specify **And** to find work items that meet the criteria in both the current clause and the previous clause. Specify **Or** to find work items that meet the criterion in either the current clause or the previous clause.

You can add one new clause for each work item field in order to refine your search criteria, so that it returns only the set of work items that you want. If you do not receive the results that you expect from your query, you can add, remove, group, or ungroup query clauses to refine your query results.

Query clauses can be grouped to operate as a single unit separate from the rest of the query, similar to putting parentheses around an expression in a mathematical equation or logic statement. When you group clauses, the **AND** or **OR** for the first clause in the group applies to the whole group.

As the following example shows, the grouped clauses are translated to the corresponding logical expression. The first expression returns work items that are priority 1, as well as all active bugs of any priority. The second expression returns all active priority 1 work items, plus all priority 1 bugs whether they are active or not.

|Grouped clauses|Logical expression|
|---|---|
|![](_img/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC425364.png)|Priority=1 OR (Work Item Type=Bug AND State=Active)|
|![](_img/query-fields-operators-values-variables/IC425365.png)|Priority=1 AND (Work Item Type=Bug OR State=Active)|

## Query field data types and values

The value you specify for a field must conform to the data type for that field. The following table lists the supported data types:

<table valign="top">
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="12%"><p>Data type</p></th>
<th width="88%"><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>

</blockquote>
</td></tr>

<tr>
	<td><p><strong>DateTime</strong> </p></td>
	<td><p>A Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) moment in time. You can specify a variable, such as <strong>@Today</strong> or <strong>@Today-1</strong>, or a value, such as 1/1/2012. For query examples, see [Query by date or@CurrentIteration](query-by-date-or-current-iteration.md). </p></td></tr>
<tr>
	<td><p><strong>Double</strong> </p></td>
	<td><p>A real number, such as 0.2 or 3.5. For query examples, see [Query by numeric fields](query-numeric.md). </p></td></tr>

	<td><p>A branching tree structure, such as an Area Path or Iteration path. You can choose an item from a list of valid values. You can find work items that equal, not equal, under or not under a tree structure, or use the In or Not In operators to specify several values.  You define the tree structure for a team project&mdash;[area paths](../customize/set-area-paths.md) and [teration paths](../customize/set-iteration-paths-sprints.md)&mdash;and then select the ones you want to [associate with a team](../scale/set-team-defaults.md).</p>

## Query operators

You can use query operators in the following table to specify how each value in a clause must relate to the corresponding value in a work item. For information about the data type that is assigned to work item fields, see [Work item field reference](../work-items/guidance/work-item-field.md).

<th width="25%"><p>Macro</p></th>
<th width="75%"><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr>
	<td><b>[Any]</b></td>
	<td>Use in conjunction with the **Work Item Type** field to search across all work item types. For example, `Work Item Type=[Any]` won't place any filters based on the work item type.
</td>
</tr>

	<td>Use in conjunction with the **Iteration Path** field to automatically filter for work items assigned to the current sprint based on the [current team focus or context](../../settings/switch-team-context.md?toc=/vsts/work/scale/toc.json&bc=/vsts/work/scale/breadcrumb/toc.json). For specific examples, see [Query by date or current iteration](query-by-date-or-current-iteration.md).
	<p>This macro only works when run from the web portal. You can't use the macro when [copying or cloning test suites and test cases](../../manual-test/mtm/copying-and-cloning-test-suites-and-test-cases.md), [defining alerts](../../notifications/index.md), or with [REST APIs](../../integrate/get-started/rest/basics.md).</p>

<tr>
	<td>**@Today**</td>
	<td>Use with a `DateTime` field to filter for work items that relate to the current date or to an earlier date. You can also modify the **@Today** macro by subtracting days. For example, you can find all items created in the last week with the clause `Created Date=@Today-7`. For additional examples, see [Query by date or current iteration](query-by-date-or-current-iteration.md).</td>

<a id="full-text" /> 
## Full-text and partial word searches

Specify **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** to search against exact or partial matches of a word or phrase. Specify **Contains Words** or **Does Not Contain Words** to search against an exact phrase or to use the wildcard character, **&#42;**. These operators use the full-text search index. You can only use the wildcard character at the end of a partial word or phrase.

For examples, see [Example work item queries](example-queries.md) and [Query for work items using the History field](history-and-auditing.md).

<!---
> [!NOTE]    
> Not all deployments support full-text searches. For example, SQL Express and SQL Azure, which support the cloud service, do not support full-text search. In these instances, you will only see the **Contains** and **Does not Contain** operators.
> -->

**Contains Words** and **Does Not Contain Words** filter items based on the full-text search index created for long-text fields. 

::: moniker range=">= tfs-2013 <= tfs-2018"
Team Foundation automatically indexes all long-text fields with a data type of **PlainText** and **HTML** and the **Title** field for full-text search. The index and operators are only available when the SQL Server that supports Team Foundation Server supports full-text search.

Full-text searches require a SQL collation that corresponds to a language which has a word breaker registered with SQL Server. If the collation settings for the team project collection database used for your Team Foundation Server instance do not correspond to a supported language, your search results may not match your expectations. In these cases, you might try using the **Contains** or **Does Not Contain** operators.

For more information, see [Full-Text Search Queries and Collation Settings](../../tfs-server/install/sql-server/collation-requirements.md).

::: moniker-end


<!---
## Query indexed fields

In addition to the full-text search index, a query index is created. It is based on those fields that have indexing enabled. The query index improves the response time when you run queries that include indexed fields.

By default, the following fields are indexed: **Assigned To**, **Created Date**, **Changed By**, **State**, **Reason**, **Area ID**, **Iteration ID**, and **Work Item Type**. If there are other fields that your team frequently uses in their queries, you can add them to the query index.

You use the **witadmin indexfield** command to enable or disable indexing for a field. See [Manage work item fields](../customize/reference/witadmin/manage-work-item-fields.md?toc=/vsts/work/customize/toc.json&bc=/vsts/work/customize/breadcrumb/toc.json).
