# Adhoc vs managed work item queries

<b>VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017</b> 


> [!NOTE]    
>**Feature availability:**&#160;&#160;The Work item search feature is available from VSTS and TFS 2017 and later versions.     

You have two ways to perform work item searches: adhoc and managed. You perform adhoc queries using the work item search box (shown below), whereas you perform managed queries using the built-in search function available from the Work hub, Queries page.

> [!NOTE]    
>With Work item or adhoc search, searches are performed against a full-text search engine that has indexed all work item fields.  


## Work item search box context 
Note that with  Work item search, the work item search box is repurposed to support adhoc queries. In order to initiate a managed search, you need to open the **Work>Queries** page.
