#### VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015  

Whether your software project is large, small, or brand new, 
in most cases you'll be better off if you use version control 
as early as possible. Here, we'll show you how to get started with 
Git, a distributed system. If you want to work in a centralized system, 
you can instead use [TFVC with VSTS](../tfvc/share-your-code-in-tfvc-vs.md).

## Clone your repository

0. Clone the repository onto your dev machine.

## Snapshot (commit) your code

With your code project stored in a local Git repository on your dev machine, 
you can commit as early and as often as you like.

0. As you write your code, your changes are automatically tracked by Visual Studio. 
You can commit one or more specific changes to your local repository from Solution Explorer
(Keyboard: Ctrl + Alt + L).

 ![When your changes are ready, select Commit](_img/share-your-code-in-git-vs/IC683030.png)

0. On the Changes page, add a comment and then commit your changes.

 ![Add a comment and choose Commit](_img/share-your-code-in-git-vs/IC683031.png)

 These changes are now committed.

0. From the commits page (Keyboard: Ctrl + 0, O), fetch the commits to see any changes that your team has made.

 ![Choose Fetch to see any changes that your team has made](_img/share-your-code-in-git-vs/IC682939.png)

0. When you're ready, pull these commits into your local repository.

0. The changes from your team are now integrated in your local repository.

## Push your local commits to the server

When the code you've written on your dev machine is ready, you can push your changes from your local Git repository to the team project.

0. From the changes page (Keyboard: Ctrl + 0, G), make sure you've committed your changes.
