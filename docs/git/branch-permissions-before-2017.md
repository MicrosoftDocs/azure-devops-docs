# Git branch permissions prior to TFS 2017 Update 1

#### TFS 2017 RTM | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013

In TFS 2017 Update 1 (and VSTS), Git repository permissions have changed.
For those customers using previous versions of TFS, here are the old permissions.
Those using TFS 2017 Update 1 or VSTS should see the [latest list of permissions](branch-permissions.md).
