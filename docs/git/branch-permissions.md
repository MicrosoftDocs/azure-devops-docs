# Set branch permissions

#### VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 Update 1

## Overview

Set up permissions to control who can read and update the code in a branch on your Git repo.
You can set permissions for individual users and groups, and inherit and override permissions as needed from your [repo permissions](../security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md#git-repository).

## Use the branches view to configure security

0. Open the **Branches** view while viewing your repo on the web.

   ![Access the branches view on the web](_img/branches/branches_nav.png)

0. Locate the branch on the **Branches** view. You can search for your branch using the **Search all branches** box in the upper right.

0. Open the context menu by selecting the **...** icon next to the branch name. Select **Branch security** from the menu.

## Add users or groups

> Avoid trouble:  You can only add permissions for users and groups already in your Team Project. [Add new users and groups to your Team Project](../security/add-users-team-project.md) before setting branch permissions. 

Add users or groups to your branch permissions by selecting **Add**, then choosing **Add user** or **Add VSTS group**. 
Enter the display name or their Microsoft Account, then select **Save Changes**.

## Remove users or groups

Remove permissions for a user or group by selecting the user or VSTS group, then selecting **Remove**. 
The user or group will still exist in your Team Project and this change will not affect other permissions for the user or group.

## Set permissions 

Control branch permission settings from the branch permission view. Users and groups with permissions set at the repo level will
[inherit those permissions](../security/about-permissions.md#inheritance) by default. 

> [!NOTE] 
> These permissions have changed in TFS 2017 Update 1 and VSTS.
> If you are using an earlier version of TFS, see the [previous list of permissions](branch-permissions-before-2017.md).
