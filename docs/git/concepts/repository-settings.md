# Repository settings
#### VSTS | TFS 2018 Update 2

Git repositories can be customized to a great extent on Visual Studio Team Services and Team Foundation Server.
Global options for entire repositories are configured by repository settings.
There are also user-specific and branch-specific controls, covered by [permissions](../../security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md#git-repository) and [branch policies](../branch-policies.md) respectively.

This topic covers server-side repository settings.
You may also want to learn about client-side [Git preferences](git-config.md).

## Forking
Controls whether users are able to create new server-side [forks](forks.md).
Disabling this setting will not alter existing forks.

## Work item management
There are two settings in this category.

### Automatically create links for work items mentioned in a commit comment

When turned on, commit messages containing "#" followed by a valid work item ID will automatically link the commit to the mentioned work item.
You should turn this off when pushing a repository previously contained by a different account or service.
Those repositories may have #mentions that don't match the work item IDs in the current account.
If you [import a repository](../import-git-repository.md), we automatically turn this option off.

### Remember user preferences for completing work items with pull requests

By default, the option to complete linked work items during pull request completion will remember each user's last choice.
Some teams may have different approaches to closing work items, such as at a standup meeting, and may want to discourage users from completing work items with their pull requests.
By disabling this setting, users must opt-in to completing work items for each pull request.  

## Case enforcement

Git is case-sensitive, meaning that a file called "Foo.txt" is different from a file called "foo.txt".
Windows and macOS default to case-insensitive file systems, meaning that "Foo.txt" and "foo.txt" are the same name.
This can cause problems for users if someone on a case-insensitive system pushes files, folders, branches, or tags that [only differ by letter case](case-sensitivity.md).

If most of your users are on Windows or macOS, we recommend turning on this setting.
It will block the introduction of new files, folders, branches, or tags that would cause such a conflict.
The user will have to rewrite their unpushed history to fix the problem, then try the push again.

This setting will not fix a repository which already contains objects that only differ by case.
We recommend fixing such issues before turning the policy on.
You can rename files and folders or re-create [branches](../create-branch.md) and [tags](../how-to/git-tags.md) using new, non-conflicting names.

## Maximum file size

Large files checked into Git remain in the repository forever, dragging down clone times and increasing disk usage.
We have suggestions for helping you [manage large files](../manage-large-files.md).

This setting gives administrators a way to block files over a certain size from entering the repository.
If a push contains a new or updated file larger than the limit configured in this setting, that push will be blocked.
The user will have to rewrite their unpushed history to remove the large file and try the push again.

## Other ways to manage repositories

For branch-specific settings, you should look at [branch policies](../branch-policies.md).
These include options like requiring a pull request, a successful build, or a code review.
For user-specific settings, you probably want [permissions](../../security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md#git-repository).
Permissions allow you to control who can read, write, contribute to pull requests, and other specific actions.
