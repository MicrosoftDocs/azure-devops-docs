# Create a new Git branch

#### VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017

>[!TIP]
> Need help creating a new Git branch in your local repo from Visual Studio or the command line? Visit the [Git tutorial](tutorial/branches.md).   

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Users of TFS 2015 and previous will not have the **Branches** tab in the **Code** view. When using those versions, you can reate a new branch in TFS from the **Code** view by selecting the drop-down next to the branch name and then selecting **New branch**.
