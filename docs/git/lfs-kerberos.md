# Kerberos authentication
If you use TFS, Git may be using the Kerberos protocol to authenticate.
(This doesn't apply to VSTS, which uses a different form of authentication.)
LFS doesn't support Kerberos, so you can get errors which say "Your user name must be of the form DOMAIN\user".
As of Git LFS version 2.4.0, [NTLM authentication with SSPI](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/pull/2871) has been added.
You'll no longer receive these errors and authentication will work without extra configuration.

**We highly recommend you upgrade to Git LFS version 2.4.0 or later, where no extra configuration is necessary.**
If you can't upgrade to 2.4.0, you can remove the Kerberos credential and let Git pick up a new NTLM credential by using the following workaround.


> [!NOTE]
> Credentials sent via HTTP will be passed in clear text.
> [Ensure your instance of TFS is configured for HTTPS](../security/websitesettings.md), and do not use HTTP with Git-LFS.
