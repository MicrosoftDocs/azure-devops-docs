# Delete a Git repo from your team project
#### VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015

Remove unused Git repos from your team project when they are no longer needed. 

>[!TIP]
> Consider [renaming](repo-rename.md) the repo and [locking](lock-branches.md) its default branch instead of removing it. The [commit history](tutorial/history.md) of the repo will be lost when it is deleted.   

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot remove a repo if it is the only Git repo in the Team Project. If you need to delete the only Git repo in a Team Project, [create a new Git repo](create-new-repo.md) first, then delete the repo.
>      
> You must have [Delete Repository permissions](../security/set-git-tfvc-repository-permissions.md#git-repository) to delete a repo from a team project.
