# Looping back to the backlog

TODO: Would need to write this part like the others: how is a backlog a form of automation? Notifications, for one thing, being able to see the data in multiple formats is another (you can spend lots of time messing with reporting). Auto-generating backlog items from DevOps outputs is also possible; a centralized repository simplifies communication, and of course having hooks into the rest of the system is helpful.
