# Practical DevOps: A guide for Development Managers to grow their DevOps practice

The developer and operations activities that have come to be known collectively as "DevOps" are not arbitrary inventions. Those activities were created, and continue to evolve, in response to a few fundamental needs of any software business:

- To shorten the time it takes to deliver value to customers through apps and services.
- To shorten the time it takes to incorporate customer requirements and feedback into the value being delivered.
- To lower overall production costs of delivering value to customers.

In business terms, the overall "performance" of those apps and services is directly proportional to the value delivered minus the costs incurred to deliver that value. Maximizing this "performance" is the goal of any organization that produces software, and therefore such an organization naturally seeks to continuously validate that performance in any number of ways that make sense to both product and personnel.

As this series of articles explores, such continuous validation is what DevOps is fundamentally all about, and how Azure DevOps provides you with a complete toolset.

## Writing code vs. delivering value

By historical standards, writing code is easy. Today we enjoy enormously powerful tools like syntax coloring, auto-formatting, code analysis, IntelliSense, error highlighting, often highly-responsive support through communities like StackOverflow, and even nascent AI tools that promise to even write code for you. We also enjoy an ever-growing repository of exceptionally useful libraries and tools, many of them free and open-source.

However, as a development manager you also know that there's a big gap&mdash;a veritable chasm, you might say&mdash;between the mere act of writing code and the development of software that delivers the highest value to customers at the lowest cost to your business. The various practices that have come to be known collectively as *DevOps* are essentially what help you bridge that chasm.

![DevOps bridges the gap between writing code and delivering value to customers](media/01-devops-as-bridge.png)

We say "various practices" because there are many ways to build that bridge. There are different ways to define the processes themselves, and there are many different tools to help you communicate and manage those processes with all the people involved&mdash;including ways to learn directly from your customers.

Unfortunately, this flexibility has made the whole DevOps space seems quite chaotic, with too many choices and too little clarity. It's not unlike the building of the first Transcontinental Railroad in America&mdash;many people intuitively knew how important the project was, and as a result, all kinds of people clamored to claim a piece of the pie, for better or for worse.

Today, there is growing interest in DevOps among app developers and developer organizations. And yet with the chaos of the marketplace&mdash;by which we mean the hundreds of companies from startups to established players alike that are offering solutions&mdash;it's challenging to know where, exactly, to start. Ask fifty developers what they think DevOps means and you get fifty different answers. Some will constrain their concept of DevOps to the one or two specific practices, like source control, that they've adopted in their workgroup; others will throw about the idea of "doing DevOps" in pseudo-mystical tones; and many more are likely to speak of "DevOps” as some kind of grand package that you must adopt in an all-or-nothing fashion.

The truth is nothing of the sort. "DevOps" encompasses many different practical and straightforward activities that can be adopted *incrementally* as it makes sense to your business. Each organization's implementation of "DevOps" is therefore unique because the goal, again, is to maximize overall performance, and the performance of *your* particular apps and services in *your* particular business.

This incremental and specific nature of "DevOps" is essential to understand. If the purpose of DevOps is to mature your business from one that just writes code to one that delivers great customer value at the lowest cost, then *each and every practice you adopt must accrue to either or both of those goals*. That is, there's no point whatsoever to adopt a DevOps practice just because it's there. It should&mdash;it must&mdash;prove its value to your business. As Donovan Brown at Microsoft likes to say, "let's take a project and rub a little DevOps on it to make it better." Once you see the improvement, then rub on a little more, a little at a time, with each piece proving its value. That's the way to approach DevOps, and the story we tell in this series using the backdrop of the comprehensive solution that Microsoft offers through Azure DevOps.
