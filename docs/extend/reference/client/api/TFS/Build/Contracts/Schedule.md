# Schedule

Module path: `TFS/Build/Contracts`


### Members

* `branchFilters`: string[]. 

* `daysToBuild`: [ScheduleDays](./ScheduleDays.md). Days for a build (flags enum for days of the week)

* `scheduleJobId`: string. The Job ID of the Scheduled job that queues the scheduled build. Since a single trigger can have multiple schedules and we want a single job to process a single schedule (since each schedule has a list of branches to build), the schedule itself needs to define the Job Id. This value is filled in when a definition is added or updated.  The UI doesn't provide it or use it.

* `startHours`: number. Local timezone hour to start

* `startMinutes`: number. Local timezone minute to start

* `timeZoneId`: string. Time zone of the build schedule (string representation of the time zone id)
