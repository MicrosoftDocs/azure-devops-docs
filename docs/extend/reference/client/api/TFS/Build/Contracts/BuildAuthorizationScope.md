# BuildAuthorizationScope

Module path: `TFS/Build/Contracts`

### Values

* `ProjectCollection` The identity used should have build service account permissions scoped to the project collection. This is useful when resources for a single build are spread across multiple projects.
* `Project` The identity used should have build service account permissions scoped to the project in which the build definition resides. This is useful for isolation of build jobs to a particular project to avoid any unintentional escalation of privilege attacks during a build.
