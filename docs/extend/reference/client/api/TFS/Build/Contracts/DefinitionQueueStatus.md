# DefinitionQueueStatus

Module path: `TFS/Build/Contracts`

### Values

* `Enabled` When enabled, the definition queue allows builds to be queued by users, the system queues scheduled, gated and continuous integration builds, and the queued builds are started by the system.
* `Paused` When paused, the definition queue allows builds to be queued by users and the system queues scheduled, gated and continuous integration builds. Builds in the queue are not started by the system.
* `Disabled` When disabled, the definition queue doesn't allow builds to be queued by users and the system doesn't queue scheduled, gated or continuous integration builds. Builds already in the queue aren't started by the system.
