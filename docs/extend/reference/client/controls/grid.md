# Grid control

See [Use grid](../../../develop/ui-controls/grido.md) for basic usage and advanced samples.

## Create a grid

### TypeScript
``` javascript
import Controls = require("VSS/Controls");
import Grids = require("VSS/Controls/Grids");

// Create the grid in a container element
var grid = Controls.create<Grids.Grid, Grids.IGridOptions>(Grids.Grid, container, options);
```

### JavaScript
``` javascript
require(["VSS/Controls", "VSS/Controls/Grids"], function(Controls, Grids) {
    // Create the grid in a container element
    var grid = Controls.create(Grids.Grid, container, options);
});
```

## Q & A

<!-- BEGINSECTION class="m-qanda" -->

#### Q: How is the performance with huge data?

A: Grid uses UI virtualization which performs great on tens of thousands of rows. 

#### Q: Can I have variable height rows?

A: No at the moment. This is caused by UI virtualization where scrolling is managed by grid itself. However, we are thinking to improve this scenario.
