# REST Clients

[!INCLUDE [disclaimer](./api/_data/disclaimer.md)]

A REST client simplifies calling [Azure DevOps Services REST APIs](/rest/api/vsts/) from your client-side (JavaScript/TypeScript) extension code.

[!INCLUDE [rest-api-docs-rollout](../../../_shared/rest-api-docs-rollout.md)]

### Get started

To get started with calling client methods from your extension, see [how to call a REST API](../../develop/call-rest-api.md). In general, the steps are:

1. Construct or acquire an instance of a client
2. Call the method on the client instance, passing any necessary parameters
3. Wait for the response
   * All REST client methods are non-blocking and return a Promise object. A promise represents a future return value (or exception). Typically you call `then()` on the returned object, passing a function that you want to have called when the response is received.

### Available clients
