# Deploy web content to Azure

<div class="alert alert-info">
	If your extension does not require any back-end logic, consider hosting your static content direcly on VSTS. See [content hosting](../develop/static-content.md).
</div>

After you've [created an extension](../get-started/node.md), you can publish it to Azure so that it's available in the cloud.

[!INCLUDE [Publish](../_shared/procedures/publish-azure.md)]
