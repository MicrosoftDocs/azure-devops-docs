# Deploy web content to Azure

[!INCLUDE [version-tfs-2017-through-vsts](../../includes/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

<div class="alert alert-info">
    If your extension doesn't require any back-end logic, consider hosting your static content directly on Azure DevOps. See <a href="../develop/static-content.md" data-raw-source="[content hosting](../develop/static-content.md)">content hosting</a>.
</div>

After you've [created an extension](../get-started/node.md), you can publish it to Azure so that it's available in the cloud.
