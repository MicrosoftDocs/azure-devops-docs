These properties are required:

| Property | Description | Notes |
|---------------------|-------------|-------|
| **manifestVersion** | *A number corresponding to the version of the manifest format.*  | This should be `1`. |
| **id** | *The extension's identifier.* | This is a string that must be unique among extensions from the same publisher. It must start with an alphabetic or numeric character and contain 'A' through 'Z', 'a' through 'z', '0' through '9', and '-' (hyphen). Example: `sample-extension`. |
| **version** | *A string specifying the version of an extension.* | Should be in the format `major.minor.patch`, for example `0.1.2` or `1.0.0`. You can also add a fourth number for the following format: `0.1.2.3`|
| **name** | *A short, human-readable name of the extension. Limited to 200 characters.* | Example: `"Fabrikam Agile Board Extension"`. |
| **publisher** | *The identifier of the publisher.* | This identifier must match the identifier the extension is published under. See [Create and manage a publisher](../publish/overview.md). |
| **categories** | *Array of strings representing the categories your extension belongs to. At least one category must be provided and there is no limit to how many categories you may include.* | Valid values: `Azure Repos`, `Azure Boards`, `Azure Pipelines`, `Azure Test Plans`, and `Azure Artifacts`.<br/><br/>Notes:<ul><li>Use version >=0.6.3 of the tfx-cli if you are publishing the extension programmatically. </li><li>If using [Azure DevOps Extension Tasks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vsts-developer-tools-build-tasks) to publish then ensure that its version is >= 1.2.8 (you may need to approve the extension update due to recent scope changes).</li><li>The categories mentioned above are natively present in Visual Studio Marketplace and Azure DevOps Server 2019 & above. For extensions targeting earlier versions of Team Foundation Server (i.e. TFS <= 2018):<ul><li> If the TFS customers would be acquiring your extension via Visual Studio Marketplace (not local gallery) in connected context then leverage the categories stated above. </li><li> If you are going to share the extension directly (i.e. not via the Visual Studio Marketplace) with a customer using TFS <=2018 then leverage the following categories instead: Code, Plan and track, Build and release, Test, Collaborate, and Integrate. If your need is to share both via Visual Studio Marketplace and directly with a TFS <= 2018 customer then you would need to have 2 extension packages.</li></ul></ul>|
| **targets** | *The products and services supported by your integration or extension.* See [installation targets](../develop/manifest.md#installation-targets) for more details. | This is an array of objects, where each object has an `id` field indicating one of the following: <ul><li>`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services` (extensions that works with Azure DevOps Services or TFS),</li><li> `Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server` (extension that works with TFS),</li><li> `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Integration` (integrations that works with Azure DevOps Services or TFS), </li><li>`Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Server.Integration` (integrations that work with TFS)</li></ul> |
