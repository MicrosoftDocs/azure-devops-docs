To change an extension that has already been published, update it.

> Updating is recommended over removing and re-uploading. 

1. Select an extension from the list of displayed items.
2. Right-click and select **Update**.
3. Browse to the .vsix for your extension and upload it.

The updated version of your extension is automatically installed to accounts that have it already installed. New accounts where the extension is installed in the future also receive the latest version.
