The [extension manifest](../../develop/manifest.md) is a JSON file that defines basic information about the extension and the contributions in it.  
First let's add some information about our extension. 
Open the `vss-extension.json` file that you created in Step 1 and add the [required attributes](../../develop/manifest.md#required-attributes) which are mandatory for an extension to work.

```json
	{
		"manifestVersion": 1,
		"id": "vsts-extensions-myExtensions",
		"version": "1.0.0",
		"name": "My First Set of Widgets",
		"description": "Samples containing different widgets extending dashboards",
		"publisher": "fabrikam",
		"targets": [
			{
				"id": "Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services"
			}
		],
	}
```

If you haven't created a publisher yet, follow the steps [here](../../publish/overview.md#create-a-publisher) to create one.
Update the `publisher` property above to include your publisher ID instead of `fabrikam`.
Update the ID, name, and description for the extension as you see fit. 
If you have an icon for the extension from the previous step, then specify the relative path to the icon in the manifest as below.
The name, description, and icon you provide show up in the Marketplace for users with whom you share the extension.

```json
	{
		...
		"icons": {
			"default": "img/logo.png"
		},
		...
	}
```


Now lets add some information for the contributions in this extension. In our case, this is the Hello World widget we created.
Add a `contributions` property to the JSON file. The value for this property is an array of contributions. In our case, we have a single entry to add.


```json
	{
		...
	    "contributions": [
			{
				"id": "HelloWorldWidget",
				"type": "ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget",
				"targets": [
					"ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget-catalog"
				],
				"properties": {
					"name": "Hello World Widget",
					"description": "My first widget",
					"catalogIconUrl:": "img/CatalogIcon.png",
					"previewImageUrl": "img/preview.png",                			
					"uri": "hello-world.html",
					"supportedSizes": [
 						{
                        		"rowSpan": 1,
                        		"columnSpan": 2
                    		}
                		],
					"supportedScopes": ["project_team"]
				}
	        }
		],
		...
    }
```

Each contribution entry defines [certain properties](../../develop/manifest.md#contributions). 

- The **id** to identify your contribution. This should be unique within an extension. This ID should match with the name you used in Step 3 to register your widget.
- The **type** of contribution. For all widgets, this should be `ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget`.
- The array of **targets** to which the contribution is contributing. For all widgets, this should be `[ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget-catalog]`.
- The **properties** is an object that includes properties for the contribution type. For widgets, the below properties are mandatory.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name | Name of the widget to display in the widget catalog. |
| description | Description of the widget to display in the widget catalog. |
| catalogIconUrl | Relative path of the catalog icon that you added in Step 4 to display in the widget catalog. The image should be 98px x 98px. If you have used a different folder structure or a different file name, then this is the place to specify the appropriate relative path. |
| previewImageUrl | Relative path of the preview image that you added in Step 4 to display in the widget catalog for TFS 2015 Update 3 only. The image should be 330px x 160px. If you have used a different folder structure or a different file name, then this is the place to specify the appropriate relative path. |
| uri | Relative path of the HTML file that you added in Step 1. If you have used a different folder structure or a different file name, then this is the place to specify the appropriate relative path. |
| supportedSizes | Array of sizes supported by your widget. When a widget supports multiple sizes, the first size in the array is the default size of the widget. The widget size is specified in terms of the rows and columns occupied by the widget in the dashboard grid. One row/column corresponds to 160px. Any dimension above 1x1 gets an additional 10px that represent the gutter between widgets. For example, a 3x2 widget is `160*3+10*2` wide and `160*2+10*1` tall. The maximum supported size is `4x4`. |
| supportedScopes | At the moment we support only team dashboards. Therefore, the value here has to be `project_team`. In the future when we support other dashboard scopes, there are more options to choose from here. |

The last thing to add in the manifest is an array of files/folders you want to include in your package. If you have used a different folder structure or file name in Step 1, then use the appropriate relative path here.
