Before an extension can be installed into an organization in Azure DevOps Services, it must be shared with that organization. Sharing is a requirement during development and testing of an extension, as it is the only way to run an extension.

To share an extension so it can be installed:

1. Click an extension from the list of displayed items 
2. Click the **Share** button
3. Specify the name of the organization to make this extension visible to.
    For example, to make an extension visible to the **dev.azure.com/fabrikam-fiber-inc** organization, specify `fabrikam-fiber-inc`.
