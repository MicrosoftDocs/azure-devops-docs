# Data storage

VSTS extensions have the ability to store user preferences and complex data structures directly on Microsoft-provided infrastructure. This ensures your user's data is secure and backed up just like other account and project data. It also means for simple data storage needs, you (as the extension provider) are not required to setup or manage (or pay for) third-party data storage services.

There are two ways to interact with the data storage service: REST APIs or a Microsoft-provided client service available as part of the VSS SDK. It is highly recommended that extension developers use the provided client service APIs, which provide a convenient wrapper over the REST APIs. 

### What you can store

The service is designed to let you store and manage two different types of data:

1. **Settings**: simple key-value settings (like user preferences)
2. **Documents**: collections of similar complex objects (documents)

A collection is as an indexed container for documents. A document is a JSON blob that belongs to a collection. Other than a few reserved property names, the schema of these documents is controlled and managed by you. 

### How you can scope data

Settings and document collections can be scoped to either the:

1. **Project Collection**: shared by all users of the project collection to which the extension is installed
2. **User**: a single user of a project collection to which the extension is installed

## Setting storage

The two primary functions for interacting with settings are getValue() and setValue(): 

* `getValue()` takes a string key (and other options such as scope) and returns an IPromise. The resolution of this promise will contain a value for the provided key. 
* `setValue()` take a string key and a value (and other options such as scope) and returns an IPromise. The resolution this promise will contain the new value of the setting.

Here is an example of how to set a value:

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        // Set value in user scope
        dataService.setValue("userScopedKey", 12345, {scopeType: "User"}).then(function(value) {
            console.log("User scoped key value is " + value);
        });
    });
```

Here is an example of how to retrieve a setting value:

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        // Get value in user scope
        dataService.getValue("userScopedKey", {scopeType: "User"}).then(function(value) {
            console.log("User scoped key value is " + value);
        });
    });
```

If `scopeType` is not specified, the settings are stored at the project collection level and they are accessible to all users in that project collection using the extension.
Here is an example of how to set a setting value at the project collection level:

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        // Set value (default is project collection scope)
        dataService.setValue("someKey", "abcd-efgh").then(function(value) {
            console.log("Key value is " + value);
        });
    });
```

## Data (collections of documents) storage

For interacting with richer data beyond key-value pairs, you can use the concepts of documents to perform CRUD operations on their extension's data. A document is a JSON blob, augmented with two special properties: ID and `__etag`. IDs can be user-defined if they are important a extension's data model, or, if left undefined, will be generated by the system. These IDs must be unique within a particular collection. Because a collection references a particular scope and instance of an extension, this means that the same document ID can be used across different collections. 

The following document operations are available:

* Get a document
* Create a document
* Set a document (create or update)
* Update a document
* Delete a document

There is also a single operation that can be performed on a collection:

* Get all documents

### Get a document by ID

Retrieving a document by its identifier from a collection is easy:

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        // Get document by id
        dataService.getDocument("MyCollection", "MyDocumentId").then(function(doc) {
            // Assuming document has a property named foo
            console.log("Doc foo: " + doc.foo); 
        });
    });
```

This call will attempt to retrieve a document with the ID "MyDocumentId", from the collection "MyCollection". Since no scope is provided, the collection that the service will use is scoped to the default of the entire instance of this extension. If this collection does not exist or a document with that ID does not exist, then a 404 will be returned, which should be handled by the extension. The document that is returned is a JSON object containing all of its own properties, in addition to the special ID and `__etag` properties used by the data storage service.

### Create a document

To create a new document, perform a call such as the following:

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        // Prepare document first
        var newDoc = {
            fullScreen: false,
            screenWidth: 500
        };
        
        dataService.createDocument("MyCollection", newDoc).then(function(doc) {
            // Even if no ID was passed to createDocument, one will be generated
            console.log("Doc id: " + doc.id);
        });
    });
```


If the collection with the name and scope provided, does not yet exist, it will be created dynamically before the document itself is created. 

If the document provided contains an `id` property, that value will be used as the unique ID for the document. If that field does not exist, a GUID will be generated by the service and included on the document that is returned when the promise is resolved. 

If another document in the collection already exists with the same ID as the one provided on the document, the operation will fail. If the desired behavior is create a new document if the ID does not exist, but modify the existing document if it does, then the `setDocument()` method should be used.

### Set a document (update or create)

`setDocument()` performs the equivalent of an "upsert" operation - modifying an existing document if there is an ID on the document provided that exists in the collection. If the ID does not exist, or no ID was provided, then a new document will be added to the collection. 

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        // Prepare document first
        var myDoc = {
            id: 1,
            fullScreen: false,
            screenWidth: 500
        };
        
        dataService.setDocument("MyCollection", myDoc).then(function(doc) {
            console.log("Doc id: " + doc.id);
        });
    });

```

### Update a document

updateDocument requires that the document which is being modified already exists in the collection. If no ID is provided or the ID provided on the document does not exist in the collection, then an exception is thrown.

Here is an example of how update is used:

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        var collection = "MyCollection";
        var docId = "1234-4567-8910";
        // Get document first
        dataService.getDocument(collection, docId, { scopeType: "User" }).then(function(doc) {
            // Update the document
            doc.name = "John Doe";
            dataService.updateDocument(collection, doc, { scopeType: "User" }).then(function(d) {
                // Check the new version
                console.log("Doc version: " + d.__etag);
            });
        });
    });
```

### Delete a document

This function will delete the document with the provided ID from the provided collection. If the collection does not exist or the document does not exist, a 404 will be returned.

Here is an example usage:
```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        var docId = "1234-4567-8910";
        // Delete document
        dataService.deleteDocument("MyCollection", docId).then(function() {
            console.log("Doc deleted");
        });
    });
```

### Get all documents in a collection

In addition to the operations on documents themselves, the data storage service provides a single operation on collections - retrieving all documents within a single collection. This call looks like the following:

```js
    // Get data service
    VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
        // Get all document under the collection
        dataService.getDocuments("MyCollection").then(function(docs) {
            console.log("There are " + docs.length + " in the collection.");
        });
    });

```

This call will return all documents within a scoped collection. If the collection does not exist, a 404 will be returned.

### Advanced

#### How settings are stored

This call wraps the setDocument client method, passing it several pieces of information. As previously mentioned, settings are stored as documents internally, so a simple document is created on the fly, where the ID of the document, is the key that was provided in the setValue() method. There are two additional properties on the document. One is 'value', which contains value passed to the method. The other is 'revision', which is set to -1. The revision property will be discussed in more detail in the "Working with Documents" section, but in the context of settings, by passing revision: -1 in the document, we are indicating that we do not care about the versioning of this setting document. 

Because settings are stored as documents, we need to provide a collection name, indicating where to store the document. To keep things simple, when working with the setValue()/getValue() methods, the collection name will always be the special name '$settings'. The call above would issue a PUT Request at the following endpoint:

```httprequest 
GET _apis/ExtensionManagement/InstalledExtensions/{publisherName}/{extensionName}/Data/Scopes/User/Me/Collections/%24settings/Documents
```

The request payload would be the following:

```json
{
                "id": "myKey",
                "__etag": -1,
                "value": "myValue"
}
```
#### REST APIs

Assuming this snippet is executed after the value has already been set, you should see an alert message containing the text "The value is myValue". The getValue method is again a wrapper around the REST APIs, issuing a GET request to the following endpoint:

```httprequest
GET _apis/ExtensionManagement/InstalledExtensions/{publisherName}/{extensionName}/Data/Scopes/User/Me/Collections/%24settings/Documents/myKey
```

#### etags

The `__etag` field is how the Data Storage Service handles document concurrency. Before an update to a document is stored by the service, a check is performed to verify that the `__etag` of the document currently stored is equal to the `__etag` of the document passed as part of the updated. If this check succeeds, the `__etag` is incremented, and the new document is returned to the caller. If this check fails, it means that the document that was attempted to be updated was out of date, and an exception will be thrown. It is up to the extension writer to gracefully handle this exception, by either getting the latest `__etag` of the document merging the changes, and re-attempting the update, or bubbling up a message to the user.

There may be certain types of documents where this level of concurrency is not needed, and a last-in-wins model is what is actually desired. For these cases, when editing the document, pass -1 as the `__etag` value, to indicate this type of functionality. The settings service described above uses this model for saving settings and preferences.
