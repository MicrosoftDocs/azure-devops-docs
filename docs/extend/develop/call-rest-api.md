# Call a REST API

To call a REST API from your extension, get the client service first, and then use that to call the API.

## Client services

You can find the [full list of available REST clients and their references here](../reference/client/rest-clients.md).

## Call an API

> You'll have to add the scope `"scopes": ["vso.work"],` to your `vss-extension.json` to use the work item tracking client.

[!INCLUDE [REST](../_shared/procedures/call-rest-api-js.md)]

## Try this next

Display the results of your REST API call [in a Grid](./ui-controls/grido.md).
