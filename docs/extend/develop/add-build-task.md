# Add a custom pipelines task extension

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

This article explains how to install extensions to your organization for custom build or release tasks in Azure DevOps. For more information, see [What is Azure Pipelines?](../../pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines.md)

> [!NOTE]
> This article covers agent tasks in agent-based extensions. For more information on server tasks and server-based extensions, see the [Server Task Authoring](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/docs/authoring/servertaskauthoring.md).

## Prerequisites

- An organization in Azure DevOps. [Create an organization](../../organizations/accounts/create-organization.md).
- A text editor. For many tutorials, we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which provides intellisense and debugging support.
- The latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- npmjs.com 4.0.2 or newer. Install the [latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) of this TypeScript compiler.
- [Cross-platform CLI for Azure DevOps (tfx-cli)](https://github.com/microsoft/tfs-cli) to package your extensions.
    - tfx-cli can be installed using `npm`, a component of Node.js, by running `npm i -g tfx-cli`.
- Azure DevOps extension SDK. Install the [azure-devops-extension-sdk](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-extension-sdk) package.
- A `home` directory for your project. The `home` directory of a build or release task extension should have the following structure after you complete the steps in this article:

    ```
    |--- README.md    
    |--- images                        
        |--- extension-icon.png  
    |--- buildandreleasetask            // where your task scripts are placed
    |--- vss-extension.json             // extension's manifest
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The dev machine must run the [latest version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to ensure that the written code is compatible with the production environment on the agent and the latest non-preview version of `azure-pipelines-task-lib`. Update your `task.json` file as per the following command:
>```
>"execution": {
>    "Node20_1": {
>      "target": "index.js"
>    }
>  }
>```

<a name="createtask"></a>

## 1. Create a custom task

Do every part of this procedure within the `buildandreleasetask` folder inside your `home` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> This example walkthrough uses Windows with PowerShell. The steps are generic for all platforms, but the syntax for getting environment variables is different. If you're using a Mac or Linux, replace any instances of `$env:<var>=<val>` with `export <var>=<val>`.

### Create task scaffolding

1. Create the folder structure for the task and install the required libraries and dependencies.

1. Open a PowerShell command window, go to your `buildandreleasetask` folder, and run the following command.

   ```powershell
   npm init --yes
   ```

   `npm init` creates the `package.json` file. We added the `--yes` parameter to accept all of the default `npm init` options.

   > [!TIP]
   > The agent doesn't automatically install the required modules because it's expecting your task folder to include the node modules. To mitigate, copy the `node_modules` to `buildandreleasetask`. As your task gets bigger, it's easy to exceed the size limit (50 MB) of a VSIX file. Before you copy the node folder, you might want to run `npm install --production` or `npm prune --production`, or you can write a script to build and pack everything.

1. Add `azure-pipelines-task-lib` to your library.

   ```powershell
   npm install azure-pipelines-task-lib --save
   ```

1. Ensure that TypeScript typings are installed for external dependencies.

   ```powershell
   npm install @types/node --save-dev
   npm install @types/q --save-dev
   ```

1. Create a `.gitignore` file and add node_modules to it. Your build process should do an `npm install` and a `typings install` so that node_modules are built each time and don't need to be checked in.

   ```powershell
   echo node_modules > .gitignore
   ```

1. Install [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) as a development dependency.

   ```powershell
   npm install mocha --save-dev -g
   npm install sync-request --save-dev
   npm install @types/mocha --save-dev
   ```

1. Choose TypeScript version 2.3.4 or 4.6.3.

   ```powershell
   npm install typescript@4.6.3 -g --save-dev
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure that TypeScript is installed globally with `npm` in your development environment, so the `tsc` command is available. If you skip this step, TypeScript version 2.3.4 gets used by default, and you still have to install the package globally to have the `tsc` command available.

1. Create `tsconfig.json` compiler options. This file ensures that your TypeScript files are compiled to JavaScript files.

   ```powershell
   tsc --init --target es2022
   ```

### Create task

Now that the scaffolding is complete, you can create your custom task.

1. Create a `task.json` file in the `buildandreleasetask` folder. The `task.json` file describes the build/release task and is what the build/release system uses to render configuration options to the user and to know which scripts to execute at build/release time.

1. Copy the following code and replace the `{{placeholders}}` with your task's information. The most important placeholder is the `taskguid`, and it must be unique.

   ```json
   {
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-task-lib/master/tasks.schema.json",
    "id": "{{taskguid}}",
    "name": "{{taskname}}",
    "friendlyName": "{{taskfriendlyname}}",
    "description": "{{taskdescription}}",
    "helpMarkDown": "",
    "category": "Utility",
    "author": "{{taskauthor}}",
    "version": {
        "Major": 0,
        "Minor": 1,
        "Patch": 0
    },
    "instanceNameFormat": "Echo $(samplestring)",
    "inputs": [
        {
            "name": "samplestring",
            "type": "string",
            "label": "Sample String",
            "defaultValue": "",
            "required": true,
            "helpMarkDown": "A sample string"
        }
    ],
    "execution": {
        "Node20_1": {
            "target": "index.js"
        }
    }
    }
   ```

1. Create an `index.ts` file by using the following code as a reference. This code runs when the task gets called.

   ```typescript
   import tl = require('azure-pipelines-task-lib/task');

    async function run() {
        try {
            const inputString: string | undefined = tl.getInput('samplestring', true);
            if (inputString == 'bad') {
                tl.setResult(tl.TaskResult.Failed, 'Bad input was given');
                return;
            }
            console.log('Hello', inputString);
        }
        catch (err:any) {
            tl.setResult(tl.TaskResult.Failed, err.message);
        }
    }

    run();
   ```

1. To compile an `index.js` file from `index.ts`, enter `tsc` from the `buildandreleasetask` folder.

#### task.json components

See the following descriptions of some of the components of the `task.json` file.

| Property             | Description               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `id`                 | A unique GUID for your task.         |
| `name`               | Name with no spaces.                 |
| `friendlyName`       | Descriptive name (spaces allowed).   |
| `description`        | Detailed description of what your task does.   |
| `author`             | Short string describing the entity developing the build or release task, for example: *Microsoft Corporation* |
| `instanceNameFormat` | How the task displays within the build/release step list. You can use variable values by using **$(variablename)**. |
| `groups`             | Describes the logical grouping of task properties in the UI.     |
| `inputs`             | Inputs to be used when your build or release task runs. This task expects an input with the name **samplestring**.  |
| `execution`          | There are multiple execution options for this task, including scripts, like `Node`, `PowerShell`, `PowerShell3`, or `Process`.  |
| `restrictions`       | Restrictions being applied to the task about [GitHub Codespaces commands](../../pipelines/scripts/logging-commands.md) that the task can call, and variables that the task can set. We recommend that you specify restriction mode for new tasks.|

> [!NOTE]
> Create an `id` with the following command in PowerShell:
> ```powershell
> (New-Guid).Guid
> ```
> For more information, see the [Build/release task reference](./integrate-build-task.md).

### Run the task 

Run the task by using `node index.js` from PowerShell.

In the following example, the task fails because inputs weren't supplied (`samplestring` is a required input).

```output
 node index.js
 ##vso[task.debug]agent.workFolder=undefined
 ##vso[task.debug]loading inputs and endpoints
 ##vso[task.debug]loaded 0
 ##vso[task.debug]task result: Failed
 ##vso[task.issue type=error;]Input required: samplestring
 ##vso[task.complete result=Failed;]Input required: samplestring
```

As a fix, set the `samplestring` input and run the task again.

```output
$env:INPUT_SAMPLESTRING="Human"
node index.js
##vso[task.debug]agent.workFolder=undefined
##vso[task.debug]loading inputs and endpoints
##vso[task.debug]loading INPUT_SAMPLESTRING
##vso[task.debug]loaded 1
##vso[task.debug]Agent.ProxyUrl=undefined
##vso[task.debug]Agent.CAInfo=undefined
##vso[task.debug]Agent.ClientCert=undefined
##vso[task.debug]Agent.SkipCertValidation=undefined
##vso[task.debug]samplestring=Human
Hello Human
```

This time, the task succeeds because `samplestring` was supplied, and it correctly outputs *Hello Human!*

> [!TIP]
> For information about various task runners and how to include the latest node version in the `task.json`, see [Node runner update guidance for Azure Pipelines task authors](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/node-runner-update-guidance-for-azure-pipelines-task-authors/#upcoming-changes).

<a name="testscripts"></a>

## 2. Unit test your task scripts

Do unit tests to quickly test the task script, and not the external tools that it calls. Test all aspects of both success and failure paths.

1. Install test tools. We use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the test driver in this procedure.

    ```powershell
    npm install mocha --save-dev -g
    npm install sync-request --save-dev
    npm install @types/mocha --save-dev
    ```

1. Create a `tests` folder containing a `_suite.ts` file with the following contents:

    ```typescript
    import * as path from 'path';
    import * as assert from 'assert';
    import * as ttm from 'azure-pipelines-task-lib/mock-test';
    
    describe('Sample task tests', function () {
    
        before( function() {
    
        });
    
        after(() => {
    
        });
    
        it('should succeed with simple inputs', function(done: Mocha.Done) {
            // Add success test here
        });
    
        it('it should fail if tool returns 1', function(done: Mocha.Done) {
            // Add failure test here
        });    
    });
    ```

   > [!TIP]
   > Your test folder should be located in the `buildandreleasetask` folder. If you get a sync-request error, you can work around it by adding sync-request to the `buildandreleasetask` folder with the command
   > `npm i --save-dev sync-request`.

1. Create a `success.ts` file in your test directory with the following contents. This file creation simulates running the task and mocks all calls to outside methods.

    ```typescript
    import ma = require('azure-pipelines-task-lib/mock-answer');
    import tmrm = require('azure-pipelines-task-lib/mock-run');
    import path = require('path');
    
    let taskPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'index.js');
    let tmr: tmrm.TaskMockRunner = new tmrm.TaskMockRunner(taskPath);
    
    tmr.setInput('samplestring', 'human');
    
    tmr.run();
    ```

   The success test validates that, with the appropriate inputs, it succeeds with no errors or warnings and returns the correct output.

1. To run the task mock runner, add the following example success test to your `_suite.ts` file.

   ```typescript
        it('should succeed with simple inputs', function(done: Mocha.Done) {
        this.timeout(1000);

        let tp: string = path.join(__dirname, 'success.js');
        let tr: ttm.MockTestRunner = new ttm.MockTestRunner(tp);

        // tr.run(); //current, old function.
        tr.runAsync().then(() => {
            console.log(tr.succeeded);
            assert.equal(tr.succeeded, true, 'should have succeeded');
            assert.equal(tr.warningIssues.length, 0, "should have no warnings");
            assert.equal(tr.errorIssues.length, 0, "should have no errors");
            console.log(tr.stdout);
            assert.equal(tr.stdout.indexOf('Hello human') >= 0, true, "should display Hello human");
            done();
        }).catch((error) => {
            done(error); // Ensure the test case fails if there's an error
        });
    });
   ```

1. Create a `failure.ts` file in your test directory as your task mock runner with the following contents:

    ```typescript
    import ma = require('azure-pipelines-task-lib/mock-answer');
    import tmrm = require('azure-pipelines-task-lib/mock-run');
    import path = require('path');
    
    let taskPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'index.js');
    let tmr: tmrm.TaskMockRunner = new tmrm.TaskMockRunner(taskPath);
    
    tmr.setInput('samplestring', 'bad');
    
    tmr.run();
    ```

   The failure test validates that, when the tool gets bad or incomplete input, it fails in the expected way with helpful output.

1. To run the task mock runner, add the following code to your `_suite.ts` file.

    ```typescript
    it('should fail if tool returns 1', function(done: Mocha.Done) {
        this.timeout(1000);
    
        const tp = path.join(__dirname, 'failure.js');
        const tr: ttm.MockTestRunner = new ttm.MockTestRunner(tp);
    
        tr.runAsync().then(() => {
            console.log(tr.succeeded);
            assert.equal(tr.succeeded, false, 'should have failed');
            assert.equal(tr.warningIssues.length, 0, 'should have no warnings');
            assert.equal(tr.errorIssues.length, 1, 'should have 1 error issue');
            assert.equal(tr.errorIssues[0], 'Bad input was given', 'error issue output');
            assert.equal(tr.stdout.indexOf('Hello bad'), -1, 'Should not display Hello bad');
            done();
        });
    });
    ```

1. Run the tests.

    ```powershell
    tsc
    mocha tests/_suite.js
    ```

   Both tests should pass. If you want to run the tests with more verbose output (what you'd see in the build console), set the environment variable: `TASK_TEST_TRACE=1`.

   ```powershell
   $env:TASK_TEST_TRACE=1
   ```

<a name="extensionmanifest"></a>

## 3. Create the extension manifest file

The extension manifest contains all of the information about your extension. It includes links to your files, including your task folders and images folders. Ensure you created an images folder with `extension-icon.png`. The following example is an extension manifest that contains the build or release task.

Copy the following .json code and save it as your `vss-extension.json` file in your `home` directory. 

**Don't create this file in the buildandreleasetask folder.**

[!Code-javaScript[JSON](../_data/extension-build-tasks.json)]

>[!NOTE]
> Change the **publisher** to your publisher name. For more information, see [Create a publisher](#createpublisher).

### Contributions

| Property          | Description                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `id`              | Identifier of the contribution. Must be unique within the extension. Doesn't need to match the name of the build or release task. Typically the build or release task name is  in the ID of the contribution. |
| `type`            | Type of the contribution. Should be `ms.vss-distributed-task.task`.       |
| `targets`         | Contributions *targeted* by this contribution. Should be `ms.vss-distributed-task.tasks`.   |
| `properties.name` | Name of the task. This name must match the folder name of the corresponding self-contained build or release pipeline task.                                                                                    |

### Files

| Property | Description                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`   | Path of the file or folder relative to the `home` directory. |

For more information about the extension manifest file, such as its properties and what they do, see the [extension manifest reference](./manifest.md).

<a name="packageext"></a>

## 4. Package your extension

Package all of your files together to get your extension into the Visual Studio Marketplace. All extensions are packaged as VSIX 2.0-compatible .vsix files. Microsoft provides a cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) to package your extension.

Once you have the [tfx-cli](#prerequisites), go to your extension's home directory, and run the following command:

```powershell
tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json
```

> [!NOTE]
> An extension or integration's version must be incremented on every update.
> When you're updating an existing extension, either update the version in the manifest or pass the `--rev-version` command line switch. This  increments the *patch* version number of your extension and saves the new version to your manifest.
> You must rev both the task version and extension version for an update to occur. `tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json --rev-version` only updates the extension version and not the task version. For more information, see [Build Task in GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/tfs-cli/blob/master/docs/buildtasks.md).

Once your packaged extension is in a .vsix file, you're ready to publish your extension to the Marketplace.

<a name="publishext"></a>

## 5. Publish your extension

To publish your extension, first [create your publisher](#create-your-publisher), then [upload your extension](#upload-your-extension), and finally [share it](#share-your-extension).
<a name="createpublisher"></a>

### Create your publisher

All extensions, including extensions from Microsoft, are identified as being provided by a publisher.
If you aren't already a member of an existing publisher, you create one.

1. Sign in to the [Visual Studio Marketplace Publishing Portal](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage).

1. If you aren't already a member of an existing publisher, you're prompted to create a publisher. If you're not prompted to create a publisher, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select **Publish extensions** under **Related Sites**.
   * Specify an identifier for your publisher, for example: `mycompany-myteam`.
     * This identifier is used as the value for the `publisher` attribute in your extensions' manifest file.
   * Specify a display name for your publisher, for example: `My Team`.

1. Review the [Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-agreement) and select **Create**.

Your publisher is defined. In a future release, you can grant permissions to view and manage your publisher's extensions.
It's easier and more secure to publish extensions under a common publisher, without the need to share a set of credentials across users.

### Upload your extension

Find the **Upload new extension** button, go to your packaged .vsix file, and select **Upload**.

You can also upload your extension via the command-line interface (CLI) by using the `tfx extension publish` command instead of `tfx extension create` to package and publish your extension in one step. You can optionally use `--share-with` to share your extension with one or more accounts after it gets published. 

```powershell
tfx extension publish --manifest-globs your-manifest.json --share-with yourOrganization
```

### Share your extension

Now that you uploaded your extension, it's in the Marketplace, but no one can see it.
Share it with your organization so that you can install and test it.

Right-select your extension and select **Share**, and enter your organization information. You can share it with other accounts that you want to have access to your extension, too.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Publishers must be verified to share extensions publicly. For more information, see [Package/Publish/Install](../publish/overview.md).

After your extension is shared in the Marketplace, anyone who wants to use it must install it.

<a name="createbuildrelease"></a>

## 6. Create a build and release pipeline to publish the extension to Marketplace

To maintain the custom task on the Marketplace, create a build and release pipeline on Azure DevOps.

### Prerequisites to publish

- An Azure DevOps project. [Create a project](../../organizations/projects/create-project.md?tabs=preview-page).
- Azure DevOps Extension Tasks extension. [Install it for free](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vsts-developer-tools-build-tasks&targetId=85fb3d5a-9f21-420f-8de3-fc80bf29054b&utm_source=vstsproduct&utm_medium=ExtHubManageList) in your organization.
- Pipeline library variable group. Create a pipeline library variable group to hold the variables used by the pipeline. For more information, see [Add and use variable groups](../../pipelines/library/variable-groups.md?tabs=classic). You can make variable groups from the Azure DevOps Library tab or through the CLI. [Use the variables](../../pipelines/library/variable-groups.md?tabs=yaml#use-variable-groups-in-pipelines) within this group in your pipeline. Also, declare the following variables in the variable group:
    - `publisherId`: ID of your marketplace publisher
    - `extensionId`: ID of your extension, as declared in the vss-extension.json file
    - `extensionName`: Name of your extension, as declared in the vss-extension.json file
    - `artifactName`: Name of the artifact being created for the VSIX file
- Service connection. Create a new Marketplace service connection and grant access permissions for all pipelines.
- YAML pipeline. Use the following example to create a new pipeline with YAML. For more information, see [Create your first pipeline](../../pipelines/create-first-pipeline.md?tabs=javascript%2Cyaml%2Cbrowser%2Ctfs-2018-2) and [YAML schema](/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema/).

    ```yaml
        trigger: 
        - main
        pool:
          vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
        variables:
          - group: variable-group # Rename to whatever you named your variable group in the prerequisite stage of step 6
        stages:
          - stage: Run_and_publish_unit_tests
            jobs:
              - job:
                steps:
                  - task: TfxInstaller@4
                    inputs:
                      version: "v0.x"
                  - task: Npm@1
                    inputs:

                      script: |
                        cd TaskDirectory # Update to the name of the directory of your task
                        tsc
                  - task: Npm@1

### Pipeline stages

The following section helps you understand how the pipeline stages work.

#### Stage 1: Run and publish unit tests

This stage runs unit tests and publishes test results to Azure DevOps.

To run unit tests, add a custom script to the `package.json` file like the following example.

```json
"scripts": {
    "testScript": "mocha ./TestFile --reporter xunit --reporter-option output=ResultsFile.xml"
},
```

1. Add **Use Node CLI for Azure DevOps (tfx-cli)** to install the tfx-cli onto your build agent.
1. Add the `npm` task with the `install` command and target the folder with the `package.json` file.
1. Add the `Bash` task to compile the TypeScript into JavaScript.
1. Add the `npm` task with the `custom` command, target the folder that contains the unit tests, and input `testScript` as the command. Use the following inputs:
    - Command: `custom`
    - Working folder that contains package.json: `/TestsDirectory`
    - Command and arguments: `testScript`

1. Add the **Publish Test Results** task. If you're using the Mocha XUnit reporter, ensure that the result format is `JUnit` and not `XUnit`. Set the search folder to the root directory. Use the following inputs:
    - Test result format: `JUnit`
    - Test results files: `**/ResultsFile.xml`
    - Search folder: `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)`

   After the test results get published, the output under the tests tab should look like the following example.

#### Stage 2: Package the extension and publish build artifacts

1. Add **Use Node CLI for Azure DevOps (tfx-cli)** to install the tfx-cli onto your build agent.
1. Add the `npm` task with the `install` command and target the folder with the `package.json` file.
1. Add the `Bash` task to compile the TypeScript into JavaScript.
1. To query the existing version, add the **Query Extension Version** task using the following inputs:
    - Connect to: Visual Studio Marketplace
    - Visual Studio Marketplace (Service connection): Service Connection
    - Publisher ID: ID of your Visual Studio Marketplace publisher
    - Extension ID: ID of your extension in the `vss-extension.json` file
    - Increase version: Patch
    - Output Variable: `Task.Extension.Version`

1. To package the extensions based on manifest Json, add the **Package Extension** task using the following inputs:
    - Root manifests folder: Points to root directory that contains manifest file. For example, `$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)` is the root directory
    - Manifest file: `vss-extension.json`
    - Publisher ID: ID of your Visual Studio Marketplace publisher
    - Extension ID: ID of your extension in the `vss-extension.json` file
    - Extension Name: Name of your extension in the `vss-extension.json` file
    - Extension Version: `$(Task.Extension.Version)`
    - Override tasks version: checked (true)
    - Override Type: Replace Only Patch (1.0.r)
    - Extension Visibility: If the extension is still in development, set the value to *private*. To release the extension to the public, set the value to *public*.
1. To copy to published files, add the **Copy files** task using the following inputs:
    - Contents: All of the files to be copied for publishing them as an artifact
    - Target folder: The folder that the files get copied to
       - For example: `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`
1. Add **Publish build artifacts** to publish the artifacts for use in other jobs or pipelines. Use the following inputs:
    - Path to publish: The path to the folder that contains the files that are being published
       - For example: `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)`
    - Artifact name: The name given to the artifact
    - Artifacts publish location: Choose **Azure Pipelines** to use the artifact in future jobs

#### Stage 3: Download build artifacts and publish the extension

1. To install the tfx-cli onto your build agent, add **Use Node CLI for Azure DevOps (tfx-cli)**.

1. To download the artifacts onto a new job, add the **Download build artifacts** task using the following inputs:
    - Download artifacts produced by: If you're downloading the artifact on a new job from the same pipeline, select **Current build**. If you're downloading on a new pipeline, select **Specific build**
    - Download type: Choose **Specific artifact** to download all files that were published.
    - Artifact name: The published artifact's name
    - Destination directory: The folder where the files should be downloaded

1. To get the **Publish Extension** task, use the following inputs:
    - Connect to: Visual Studio Marketplace
    - Visual Studio Marketplace connection: ServiceConnection
    - Input file type: VSIX file
    - VSIX file: `/Publisher.*.vsix`
    - Publisher ID: ID of your Visual Studio Marketplace publisher
    - Extension ID: ID of your extension in the `vss-extension.json` file
    - Extension Name: Name of your extension in the `vss-extension.json` file
    - Extension visibility: Either private or public

## Optional: Install and test your extension

Install an extension that's shared with you in just a few steps:

1. From your organization control panel (`https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_admin`), go to the project collection administration page.
1. In the **Extensions** tab, find your extension in the **Extensions Shared With Me** group and select the extension link.
1. Install the extension.

If you can't see the **Extensions** tab, make sure you're in the control panel (the administration page at the project collection level, `https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_admin`) and not the administration page for a project.

If you don't see the **Extensions** tab, then extensions aren't enabled for your organization. You can get early access to the extensions feature by joining the Visual Studio Partner Program.

To package and publish Azure DevOps Extensions to the Visual Studio Marketplace, you can download [Azure DevOps Extension Tasks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vsts-developer-tools-build-tasks).

## FAQ

See the following frequently asked questions about adding custom build or release tasks in extensions for Azure DevOps.

### Q: How can I restrict Azure Pipelines commands usage for task?

You can restrict Azure Pipelines commands usage and variables, which get set by task.
This action could be useful to prevent unrestricted access to variables or vso commands for custom scripts which task executes. We recommend that you set it up for new tasks.
To apply, you might need to add the following statement to your `task.json` file:

```json
"restrictions": {
  "commands": {
    "mode": "restricted"
  },
  "settableVariables": {
    "allowed": ["variable1", "test*"]
  }
}
```

If `restricted` value is specified for `mode`, you can only execute the following commands by the task:

- `logdetail`
- `logissue`
- `complete`
- `setprogress`
- `setsecret`
- `setvariable`
- `debug`
- `settaskvariable`
- `prependpath`
- `publish`

The `settableVariables` restrictions allow you to pass in an allowlist of variables, which get set by `setvariable` or `prependpath` commands. It also allows basic regular expressions. For example, if your allowlist was: `['abc', 'test*']`, setting `abc`, `test`, or `test1` as variables with any value or prepending them to the path would succeed, but if you try to set a variable proxy it would warn. Empty list means that no variables get changed by task.

If either the `settableVariables` or `commands` key is omitted, relevant restriction isn't applied.

The restriction feature is available from [agent version 2.182.1](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases/tag/v2.182.1).

### Q: How is the cancellation signal handled by a task?

The pipeline agent sends `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals to the relevant child process. There are no explicit means in the [task library](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-task-lib) to process. For more information, see [Agent jobs cancellation](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/blob/master/docs/design/jobcancellation.md).

### Q: How can I remove the task from project collection?

We don't support the automatic deletion of tasks. Automatic deletion isn't safe and breaks existing pipelines that already use such tasks. But, you can mark tasks as deprecated. To do so, [bump the task version](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/docs/taskversionbumping.md) and [mark the task as deprecated](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/docs/deprecatedtasks.md).

### Q: How can I upgrade my custom task to the latest Node?

We recommend upgrading to [the latest Node version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). For example information, see [Upgrading tasks to Node 20](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/docs/migrateNode20.md).

Microsoft Hosted agents and various Azure DevOps Server versions have different life cycles, leading to different Node runner versions being installed depending on where a task is running. To ensure compatibility across agents with different Node runner versions, the `task.json` file can include multiple execution sections. In the following example, Azure Pipeline agents with the Node 20 runner use it by default, while agents without it fall back to the Node 10 implementation.

```nodejs
"execution": {
  "Node10": {
    "target": "bash.js",
    "argumentFormat": ""
  },
  "Node20_1": {
    "target": "bash.js",
    "argumentFormat": ""
  }
}
```

To upgrade your tasks:

* To ensure your code behaves as expected, test your tasks on the various Node runner versions.
* In your task's execution section, update from `Node` or `Node10` to `Node16` or `Node20`.
* To support older server versions, you should leave the `Node`/`Node10` target. Older Azure DevOps Server versions might not have the latest Node runner version included.
* You can choose to share the entry point defined in the target or have targets optimized to the Node version used.

   ```nodejs
   "execution": {
     "Node10": {
       "target": "bash10.js",
       "argumentFormat": ""
     },
     "Node16": {
       "target": "bash16.js",
       "argumentFormat": ""
     },
     "Node20_1": {
       "target": "bash20.js",
       "argumentFormat": ""
     }
   }
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't add support for the Node 20 runner to your custom tasks, they fail on agents installed from the `pipelines-agent-*` [release feed](../../pipelines/agents/agents.md#node-runner-versions).
