# Guidance for extension developers impacted by new navigation preview

Our new vertical navigation preview brings with it changes that impact some extensions. This includes support for extension icons along with changes to team context.

## Team context

In traditional horizontal navigation, a user could navigate into a project or team by selecting it from a picker located in the top left of the page header. This picker presented a list of recent teams and a way to browse for all teams. In the new vertical navigation, a user can only navigate into a project (and not into a team). This change was made to simplify the overall experience, but it introduces a challenge for web extensions that rely on users being able to switch teams using the traditional team picker in the page header.

`VSS.getWebContext()` is a client-side API provided by the VSS SDK that provides information about the current organization, project, and team the user is operating in:

```json
{
    "account": {
        "name": "Fabrikam",
        "id": "50e49b94-4bb6-40e7-8c85-a6d756d8a4d8"
    },
    "project": {
        "name": "Fabrikam Dev",
        "id": "049b1af2-fc87-4e50-95e4-151357f04b7f"
    },
    "team": {
        "name": "Ops Team",
        "id": "9b3a6b80-fe95-4c8c-8aa1-1e5d535d7af1"
    }
}
```
We do not recommend relaying on `VSS.getWebContext().team` and follow below guidance based on category your extension falls under.

### Hub extensions that are team aware
If your extension needs to provide users a way to select a team, you can use the Teams REST API to get a list of teams for the current project. Here is an example of how to call this API from your extension:

```javascript
VSS.require(["VSS/Service", "TFS/Core/RestClient"],
   function(VSS_Service, Tfs_Core_WebApi) {
      var client = VSS_Service.getCollectionClient(Tfs_Core_WebApi.CoreHttpClient4);
  
      client.getTeams(VSS.getWebContext().project.id).then(
         function(teams) {
            console.log(teams);
         }
      );
});
```
For an example of an extension that provides a team picker control, see [Team Calendar](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-team-calendar).

### Pivots/Panels extensions that are in team aware hubs like Backlogs and Dashboard

Your extension can check the *configuration* object passed to your contribution. This object has different properties depending on the contribution type and where the contribution is hosted. Example shows reading team from the *configuration* and falling back to reading team from *webContext* to support both new vertical navigation and older horizontal navigation in on-premise releases.

```javascript
function getCurrentTeam() {
  let webContext = VSS.getWebContext();
  let configuration = VSS.getConfiguration();

  if ("team" in configuration) {
    return configuration.team;
  } else if ("team" in webContext) {
    return webContext.team;
  } else {
    return null; // should only happen if not in a project context
  }
}
```

### Actions extensions that are in team aware hubs like Backlogs and Dashboard

Your extension can check the *actionContext* object passed to the callback invoked when a user clicks the contributed menu item. Example shows reading team from the *actionContext*.

```javascript
var menuContributionHandler = (function () {
        "use strict";
        return {
            // This is a callback that gets invoked when a user clicks the newly contributed menu item
            // The actionContext parameter contains team information.
            execute: function (actionContext) {
                if("team" in actionContext) {
                    alert(`Team. Id is ${actionContext.team.id}, Name is ${actionContext.team.name}`);
                }
            }
        };
    }());
```

## Hub icon

You can optionally set an asset (like a .png or .jpg) as the icon for your hub. This icon appears next to the hub in the vertical navigation bar. It must be packaged with your extension.

> Note: these icons don't appear in horizontal navigation

To set an icon for your hub:

1. Set the `iconAsset` property of the hub contribution to the fully-qualified asset identifier, which follows the pattern: `{publisher-id}.{extension-id}/{asset-path}`.

2. Add an entry for this asset in the `_shareData` contribution property.

3. Package the asset with your extension by listing it in the `files` property at the root of your manifest.

For example:

```json
{
  "id": "my-extension",
  "publisherId": "my-publisher",
  ...
  "contributions": [
        {
            "id": "example-hub",
            "type": "ms.vss-web.hub",
            "targets": [
                "ms.vss-code-web.code-hub-group"
            ],
            "properties": {
                "name": "My Hub",
                "iconAsset": "my-publisher.my-extension/images/fabrikam-logo.png",
                "_sharedData": {
                    "assets": [
                        "my-publisher.my-extension/images/fabrikam-logo.png"
                    ]
                }
            }
       }
  ],
 "files": [
     {
         "path": "images/fabrikam-logo.png",
         "addressable": true
     }
 ]
}
```
