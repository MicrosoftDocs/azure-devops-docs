# Extension samples

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

Get started developing your extension by working from a sample. 

[!INCLUDE [extension-docs-new-sdk](../../includes/extension-docs-new-sdk.md)]

The following Microsoft samples show the capabilities of the extension framework and how to 
contribute to various areas. Each sample illustrates one or more contributions. We've limited the 
number of contributions for each sample to increase understanding of the extension framework.

## How to get started

To get you started as quickly as possible, there's a [seed project](https://github.com/cschleiden/vsts-extension-ts-seed-simple) available that contains the files required to build an extension using TypeScript. To automate building, packaging, and publishing the extension, a grunt script is 
added.
