# Azure DevOps Services extension samples

You can get started developing your extension by working from a sample. 
The Microsoft samples listed below show the capabilities of the extension framework and how to 
contribute to various areas. Each sample illustrates one or more contributions. We've limited the 
number of contributions for each sample to increase understanding of the extension framework.

## How to get started

To get you started as quickly as possible, there is a [seed project](https://github.com/cschleiden/vsts-extension-ts-seed-simple) available
that contains the files required to build an extension using TypeScript. To automate building, packaging and publishing the extension a grunt script is 
added.

If you are interested in a sample project that contains the majority of the contributions, see the [Azure DevOps Services Sample Extensions](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-extension-samples) repository on GitHub.
