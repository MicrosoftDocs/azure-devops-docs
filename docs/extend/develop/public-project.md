# Public project support by VSTS extensions

Prior to public project support, all VSTS projects were private, meaning that only authenticated users with access to the project could see or interact with it. A public project allows non-member users to view the contents of that project in a read-only state. 

> A non-member user is either **anonymous** (not authenticated to VSTS) or **public** (are authenticated to VSTS, but do not belong to the account).

Non-member users generally see the same views as authenticated users, with non-public functionality such as settings and actions (such as queue build) either hidden or disabled.

## Decide whether to make an extension visible to non-member users

As the extension developer, you can make all or part of your extension available to non-member users. These users will only be able to use your extension from within a public project. If you choose to not make your extension available to non-member users, no change is required and there is no impact on members (regardless of whether they use your extension from within a public project or not).

Use this checklist to help decide if you should make your extension available to non-member users:

> [!div class="checklist"]
* Data presented by your extension is relevant to non-member users
* Your extension contributes capabilities at the project level
* Your extension contributes to areas of the product that are accessible by non-member users
* Your extension does not extend or rely on features that are unavailable to non-member users, for example the Data Service or certain VSTS REST APIs. See the [Limitations](#limitations) section below for more details.

## Contribution visibility

By default, contributions are only visible to account members. To give non-member users visibility to a contribution, set the `restrictedTo` attribute on that contribution. The value is a string array that lists which types of users should have visibility to the contribution. The possible values are:

* `member` an authenticated user that is a member of the account
* `public` an authenticated user that is **not** a member of the account
* `anonymous` an un-authenticated user

### Example: make a hub visible to anonymous, public, and member users

```json
{
    "contributions": [
        {
            "id": "my-hub",
            "type": "ms.vss-web.hub",
            "targets": [
                "ms.vss-code-web.code-hub-group"
            ],
            "restrictedTo": [
                "member",
                "public",
                "anonymous"
            ],
            "properties": {
                ...            
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can also set the default visibility for all contributions in your extension by setting the `restrictedTo` attribute at the root your extension manifest. You can then override this default on individual contributions.

### Example: make every contribution, except for one, visible to all users

```json
{
    "id:": "my-extension",
    "name": "My Extension",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    ...
    "restrictedTo": [
           "anonymous",
           "public",
           "member"
    ],
    "contributions": [
        {
            "id": "my-member-only-widget",
            "type": "ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget",
            "restrictedTo": [
                "member"
            ],
            "properties": {
                ...
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "my-hub",
            "type": "ms.vss-web.hub",
            "targets": [
                "ms.vss-code-web.code-hub-group"
            ],
            "properties": {  
                ...              
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "my-second-hub",
            "type": "ms.vss-web.hub",
            "targets": [
                "ms.vss-work-web.work-hub-group"
            ],
            "properties": {  
                ...              
            }
        }            
    ]
}
```

## Limitations

If you want to make some or all aspects of your contribution available to public users, be aware of the following limitations.

### VSS SDK methods

The core SDK script, VSS.SDK.js, allows web extensions to communicate with the parent frame to perform operations like initializing communication and getting context information about the current user. The following VSS SDK methods are not supported for non-member users:

* `VSS.getAccessToken()`
* `VSS.getAppToken()`

### Extension data service

Because data managed by the [extension data service](./data-storage.md) is not scoped or secured to a project, non-member users are prevented from reading or writing any type of extension data. 

#### Example: handling data access errors

If the data service is unable to access the data service due to permission limitations by the calling user, the promise returned from the call to `getValue` will be rejected. The error passed to the reject function will have a name that can be checked to understand why the call to read or write data failed.

```javascript
VSS.getService(VSS.ServiceIds.ExtensionData).then(function(dataService) {
    dataService.getValue("someKey").then(function(value) {
         // do something with the value
    }, function(error) {
       if (error.name === "AccessCheckException") {
           alert(error.message);
       }
    });
});
```

### REST APIs

A limited set of VSTS REST APIs are available to non-member users. This includes most account-level APIs and project-level APIs for features unavailable to non-member users in general. You should take this into consideration when deciding whether or not to make your extension available to non-member users.

It is also recommended that you use version 5.0 and later APIs, as certain APIs are only available to non-member users starting with version 5.0.

#### Identity references

A majority of VSTS REST APIs use a common "contract" to represent a user or group. To protect member information, like email addresses, when a REST API is invoked by an anonymous or public user, certain fields, like `uniqueName` are omitted.

## Checking user permissions

A good best practice in general is to use permissions to decide whether or not to surface or enable a capability in your extension. The Security REST API can be used from web extension code to check whether the current user has permission in VSTS to perform the task. This avoids the user thinking they have permission to do something, only to find they don't after they try to do it.

#### Example: check whether the user has permission to queue builds

This example shows how to use the Security REST client to check whether the user has permissions to queue builds in the current project. By default, non-member users will not have this permission.

```javascript
VSS.require(["VSS/Service", "VSS/Security/RestClient"], function(VSS_Service, Security_RestClient) {
   var client = VSS_Service.getCollectionClient(Security_RestClient.SecurityHttpClient3);
 
   var securityToken = VSS.getWebContext().project.id;
 
   client.hasPermissionsBatch({
    evaluations: [
       {
           "securityNamespaceId": "33344D9C-FC72-4d6f-ABA5-FA317101A7E9",
           "token": securityToken,
           "permissions": 128 /* queue builds */
       }
    ]
}
).then(function(response) {
     console.log("Can user queue builds in this project? " + response.evaluations[0].value);
  });
});
```

## Dashboard widget considerations

Just like other types of contributions, the visibility of dashboard widget contributions is controlled with the `restrictedTo` contribution property. For example to make a widget visible to both non-member and member users:

```json
{
  "contributions": [
    {
      "id": "HelloWorldWidget",
      "type": "ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget",
      "targets": [
        "ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget-catalog"
      ],
      "restrictedTo": [
        "member",
        "public",
        "anonymous"
      ],
      "properties": {
          ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Widget settings

In addition to controlling visibility of the widget to non-member users, the dashboard framework provides an optional, open-form storage mechanism for widget settings. Two mechanisms are available for indicate whether a widget's settings are available for use by non-member users in public projects. 

A widget with configurable settings that is visible to non-member users **must** follow one of the following patterns. Not doing so will block the widget from surfacing to these users.

### Pattern 1: widget declares its instances only store project-specific settings

Set the widget contribution's `canStoreCrossProjectSettings` property to `false`, indicating the widget settings are project-specific.

```json
{
    "id:": "HelloWorldWidget",
    "type": "ms.vss-dashboards-web.widget",
    ...
    "properties": {
        "canStoreCrossProjectSettings": false
    }
}
```

### Pattern 2: a widget instance declares its settings are project-specific

Individual widget instances can also indicate that its settings are project-specific and are therefore available to non-member users. When saving the settings, the widget should set the `hasCrossProjectSettings` to `false` in the stringified JSON string:

```json
{
    "hasCrossProjectSettings": false,
    "hypotheticalWidgetOption": true,
    "backlogLevel": "Stories"
}
```

## Build and release considerations

If your extension contributes a build or release task, no change is required to make use of that task from a definition in a public project.

## Work item tracking considerations

Extensions that extend the work item form or other work item experiences or interact with work item tracking REST APIs will not work for non-member users in the context of a public project without changes.

### Work item form

All work item updates or deletes will fail for non-member users.

### Identities

In VSTS REST API version 5.0 and later, identities are returned as `IdentityRef` objects instead of strings. As described above, certain fields, like `uniqueName` are not returned in these objects if the API call was made by a non-member user.

### APIs

Only project-scoped REST APIs can be invoked by an extension when the current user is not an account member. Any REST API call this is not scoped to a project will be rejected.

### Queries

There are limitations for non-member users related to work item queries:

* non-member users can only execute know queries (by ID or path)
* Queries must be scoped to the current project. Any work items not belonging to the current project will be excluded.
* non-member user cannot create new queries or execute WIQL queries
