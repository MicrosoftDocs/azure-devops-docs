# Create a custom consumer for service hooks

[!INCLUDE [version-lt-eq-azure-devops](../../includes/version-lt-eq-azure-devops.md)]

With service hooks, you can notify third-party systems about events that occur in your project. You can use a custom consumer to send an HTTP message to the endpoint thatâ€™s defined in the extension's manifest.

This article walks through developing an extension that implements a **sample consumer service**, which includes the following events and actions.

- Supported events that trigger the following actions:
  - Code pushed
  - Pull request created
  - Pull request updated
- Supported actions to take when events occur:
  - Do action (Send HTTP message)

> [!NOTE]
> In this article, we refer to the home directory for your project as "home".

For more information, see the [Extension example GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-extension-sample).
For a list of all supported events you can use as triggers for your custom consumer extension, see [List of event types](../../service-hooks/events.md).

## How service hooks work

Service hook **publishers** define a set of *events*. **Subscriptions** listen and wait for the *events* and define **actions** for when the event is triggered.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-hooks.png" alt-text="Service hooks diagram":::

This is a general description of how all our service hook implementations work. For our case, we specify our consumer defined by an extension, as well as the specified action for when an event occurs.

## Create the extension

1. [See how to create your extension from scratch](../get-started/node.md).

2. Add the specific contribution for custom consumer implementation to your basic [manifest file](./manifest.md). See the following example of how your manifest should look after you add the contribution.

For each contribution in your extension, the manifest defines the following items.
- Type of contribution - consumer service (ms.vss-servicehooks.consumer) in this case
- Contribution target - consumer services (ms.vss-servicehooks.consumers) in this case
- Properties that are specific to each type of contribution

Consumers have the following properties.

| Property         | Description                                                                             |

3. Deploy your extension to your Azure DevOps organization and test it.
