## Azure Pipelines and GitHub integration

You can use Azure Pipelines to automatically build, test, package, release, and deploy your GitHub repository code. To get started, see [Build GitHub repositories](../pipelines/repos/github.md). 

You can map your GitHub repositories to one or more projects in Azure DevOps.
