### Stakeholders can move work items across board columns (private preview)

Stakeholders have always been able to change the state of work items. But when they go to the Kanban board, they're unable to move the work items from one column to another. Instead, Stakeholders would have to open each work item, one at a time, and update the state value. This has long been a pain point for customers, and we're happy to announce a private preview this sprint that will enable Stakeholders to move work items across board columns. If you're interested in participating in the private preview, please <a href="mailto:dahellem@microsoft.com">email us directly</a> with your organization name (example: dev.azure.com/{organization name}).
