### New Test Plans page general availability

The new Azure Test Plans page has been in public preview for several months. We are glad to announce that the preview period is now complete, and we will be making the page generally available by the end of November 2020. 

This new persona-based page provides views and toolsets for tasks such as authoring, tracking, and executing tests. As an addition to the pre-existing page, the new page brings many new capabilities like Copy Test Plans, Import test suites, Copy/clone test cases, View linked items, Import/Export test plans from/to CSV files, and many more. Learn more in our public documentation: [New Test Plans Page - Azure Test Plans](/azure/devops/test/new-test-plans-page?preserve-view=true&view=azure-devops)
