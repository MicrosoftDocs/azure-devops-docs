# Team Foundation Service updates - Oct 31

## Team Foundation Service is Released!

One year ago, at the first BUILD conference, we unveiled the limited preview of Team Foundation Service. At Tech Ed, in June, we removed the “invitation code” mechanism and opened it up for anyone to try in a public preview. Now, a year after its introduction, we’re announcing that the service is out of Preview and is now available for full production use.

The new url for the service is [http://tfs.visualstudio.com](http://tfs.visualstudio.com/). The old url ([http://tfspreview.com](http://tfspreview.com/)) will continue to work for the foreseeable future but you should plan on starting to use the new url. If you already have an account, you can now access it at http://[youraccountname].visualstudio.com. Other than that, all of your data is still there (if you have a tfspreview account already) and all of the capabilities remain and the service will continue to advance every sprint (3 weeks). If you don’t already have an account, create one now and give it a try.

As part of this release, we have disclosed additional information about pricing. Although the service has now been released, our full billing infrastructure is not yet in place. See the [pricing page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/products/visual-studio-online-overview-vs) to learn more about the current status and how we expect it to evolve.

This represents the culmination of a lot of work over the last year and we are super excited about this milestone. We hope you enjoy the service and look forward to any feedback you have.

Thanks,

Brian Harry
