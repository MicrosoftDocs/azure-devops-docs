#Stakeholder licensing – Aug 27

##A license for Stakeholders

We’re delivering on the new "stakeholder license" that [I promised](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/07/09/upcoming-vs-online-licensing-changes.aspx) a few weeks ago. With this license, being activated today, any number of users in an account can be assigned a stakeholder license at no charge.

Stakeholders have access to the project home page and most of the "work" related functionality.

This includes the ability to view the backlog, add and edit items, run work item queries and more.

I hope and expect that enabling this will eliminate a lot of the friction in enabling the entire organization to participate in projects. Learn more about what you can do with a [stakeholder license](/azure/devops/organizations/security/get-started-stakeholder?view=azure-devops).

Enjoy!

Thanks,
