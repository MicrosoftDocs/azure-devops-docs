# Visual Studio Online updates - Feb 10

## Exporting test artifacts

With today’s update, you can now export test plans, test suites, and test cases along with their respective properties. Having this capability allows you to easily share test artifacts with stakeholders who do not have access to the Test hub in Visual Studio Online. To make use of the feature, simply right-click on any suite and click **Export**. Choose the artifacts and properties you want to export and then click **Email** or **Print**.

## New “create tags” permission

We’ve also surfaced a new permission that allows you to manage who can create new work item tags in your project. This permission, named “Create tag definition,” limits who can add new tags into the system. Users without this permission can still adorn work items with existing tags. This capability gives you the ability to manage your tag cloud by not allowing every user to create new ad-hoc tags.

We’re always anxious to hear your feedback. Let us know how we’re doing at [http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/support/support-overview-vs](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/support/support-overview-vs).

Thanks,

Aaron Bjork
