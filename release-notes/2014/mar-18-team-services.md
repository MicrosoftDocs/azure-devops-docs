# Visual Studio Online updates - Mar 18

## Getting started with Application Insights

The first change in today’s update is an improved getting started experience for first time users of Application Insights. The steps necessary to set up monitoring for a website are now dramatically simpler—just enter the name of your application and a URL to the actual site, and you’re ready to go. We also modified the default failure notification rules to email you directly when the website is unavailable or nonresponsive.

## Search across your application trace logs

Today’s update also includes a new trace log search feature. If your application uses Log4Net, NLog or Trace Listener, you can configure your app to use search. To make use of the feature, select **Search** under the **Diagnostics** Hub. The configuration page helps you configure and instrument your app quickly for telemetry collection.
