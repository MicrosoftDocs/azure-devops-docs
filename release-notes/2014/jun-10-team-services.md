#Visual Studio Online updates – Jun 10

##Review and Merge code with Pull Requests

Pull Requests have been one of the top [customer requests](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/3891599-tfservice-git-pull-requests) for Git projects since we enabled Git on Visual Studio Online. With today’s update, developers can now use Pull Requests to help review and merge their code. Pull Requests enable developers working in topic branches to get feedback on their changes from other developers prior to submitting the code into the mainline. Any developer participating in the review can see the code changes, leave comments in the code, and give a “thumbs up” approval if they’re satisfied with those changes. For many teams, Pull Requests are a critical component of the developer workflow in Git, and we’re excited to finally bring that experience to Visual Studio Online.

You can learn more about Pull Requests on the [Visual Studio devops blog](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?prd=12493&pver=1.0&sbp=TFS&plcid=0x409&clcid=0x409&ar=VC&sar=Pull%20Request).

Thanks,
