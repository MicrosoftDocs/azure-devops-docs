### Updates to Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) Windows Shell extension for Visual Studio 2019

The previous version of the [TFVC Windows Shell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-vcw.TfsShellExtention) only worked on computers that had Visual Studio 2017 installed. 

We have released a [new version](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-vcw.TfsShellExtentionVS2019) of this tool that is compatible with Visual Studio 2019. The extension provides integration with Windows Explorer and the common file dialogs. With this integration, you can perform many source control operations without having to run Visual Studio or a Team Foundation command-line tool.
