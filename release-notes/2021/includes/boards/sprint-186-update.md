### Fixed several issues with Delivery Plans 2.0

Delivery Plans 2.0 has been in public preview since last October. We've been acting on customer feedback and addressing issues. This release includes fixes for those issues. Specifically the inconsistent zooming behavior and scroll bar freezes have been addressed now. Cards are now ordered on the plan by date rather than backlog priority to make better use of the space.
