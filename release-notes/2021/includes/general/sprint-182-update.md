### Limited people-picker search and tagging

Using the various people pickers in the product, users and groups added to the "**Project-Scoped Users**" group will only be able to search for, view, select, and tag members who are also members of that same project.

> [!NOTE]
> The current restrictions are on the user interface only; users will still be able to use the REST APIs to produce or construe the restricted data.
