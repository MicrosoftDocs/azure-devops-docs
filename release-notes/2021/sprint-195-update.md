# Improvements to Copy Dashboard 

We are excited to announce some long awaited improvements to the Copy Dashboard preview. You can now copy a dashboard to a different team, the same team, or a different project - and team and query configuration is updated in the new dashboard. This further minimizes the work required to build similar dashboards from scratch for multiple teams.
