# Post neutral status to GitHub on validation runs with path exclusion rule 

With this update, we included multiple updates to Azure Pipelines. On YAML pipelines, we are setting deny access to all pipelines as the default for protected resources. In addition, Azure Pipelines will post a neutral status back to GitHub when it decides not to run a validation build because of a path exclusion rule. 

Check out the following feature descriptions for details.
