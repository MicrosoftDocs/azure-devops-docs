# Changes to Azure Pipelines free grants

We are temporarily changing the process to acquire Azure Pipelines free grants to address the increasing abuse of hosted agents. By default, new organizations created in Azure DevOps may no longer get a free grant of concurrent pipelines. New users will have to send an email and provide additional information to get free CI/CD. 

Check out the Features list below for details.
