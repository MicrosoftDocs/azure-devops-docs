# Support for template expressions in repository and container resource definitions

With this update, we included support for template expressions in repository and container resource definitions. Now you can use template expressions when defining the `ref` property of a `repository` resource in a YAML pipeline to choose the branch of a repository resource. In addition, we've added support for template expressions when defining the `endpoint`, `volumes`,  `ports`, and `options` properties of a `container` resource in a YAML pipeline.

Check out the release notes for details.
