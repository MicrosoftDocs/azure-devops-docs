# Maintain backlog hierarchy when filtering

With this update, we included multiple updates to Azure Boards. In backlogs, we've added the option for you to maintain the hierarchy when filtering. In addition, you can now copy the URL for a work item attachment so you can cut and paste in the description and discussion sections of the work item.
