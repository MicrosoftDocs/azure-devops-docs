# Addressed multiple requests from the Developer Community

In response to your feedback, we have prioritized multiple features that you have requested in the Developer Community. In Pipelines, we added support for string split function in YAML expression. In addition, we are now letting you disable showing the last commit message for a pipeline run. In Delivery Plans, we increased the team limit from 15 to 20.
