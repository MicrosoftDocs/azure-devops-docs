# Query by Parent Id private preview

With this update, we included multiple updates to Azure Boards. You can now query work items by Parent Id to get a flat list of children based on parent work items. In addition, we've improved managing work items in a Kanban column with **Move to position**. This will make it easier to re-order work items in columns that contain a lot of work items.

Check out the release notes for details.
