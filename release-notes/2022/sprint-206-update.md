# Filter on work item history

With this update, we included multiple updates to Azure Boards. On Delivery Plans, we added a Last accessed column to the directory page and we improved the experience by allowing you to see all the dependencies lines across all the work items on the screen. In addition, we've added a filter option to the work item history tab. This filter will let you quickly find revisions made to individual fields by specific people. 

Check out the release notes for details.
