# Improvements to strengthen pipelines security

With this update, we are including improvements to strengthen security in Azure DevOps. Now you can use a System-assigned Managed Identity when creating Docker Registry service connections for Azure Container Registry. In addition, we've enhanced access management for agent pools to let you specify the use of resources within a YAML pipeline. Lastly, we are limiting the GitHub access token for forked public GitHub repositories to have read-only scope. 

Check out the release notes for details.
