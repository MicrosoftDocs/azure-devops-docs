# Opt-in to receive notifications related to personal access tokens found in a GitHub public repository

Currently, when we discover a personal access token checked into a GitHub public repository, we send a detailed email notification to the token owner and log an event to your Azure DevOps Organizationâ€™s Audit Log. With this update, we've added the option for project collection administrators to opt-in to get notifications when a personal access token for a user that belongs to their organization is found in a GitHub public repository. This will help project collection administrators to know when there are leaked tokens that can compromise their Azure DevOps accounts and data.

Check out the release notes for details.
