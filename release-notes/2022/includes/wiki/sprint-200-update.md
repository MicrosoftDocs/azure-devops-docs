### Support for additional diagram types in wiki pages

We have upgraded the version of mermaid charts used in wiki pages to 8.13.9. With this upgrade, you can now include the following diagrams and visualizations in your Azure DevOps wiki pages:

* Flowchart
* Sequence diagrams
* Gantt charts
* Pie charts
* Requirement diagrams
* State diagrams
* User Journey

Diagrams that are in experimental mode such as Entity Relationship and Git Graph are not included. For more information about the new features, please see the [mermaid release notes](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/releases).
