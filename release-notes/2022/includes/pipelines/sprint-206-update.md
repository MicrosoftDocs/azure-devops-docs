### Current project set as default scope for build access token in classic pipelines

Azure Pipelines uses job access tokens to access other resources in Azure DevOps at run-time. A job access token is a security token that is dynamically generated by Azure Pipelines for each job at run time. Previously, when creating a new classic pipelines, the default value for the access token was set to **Project Collection**. With this update we are setting the job authorization scope to **current project** as the default when creating a new classic pipeline. 

You can find more details about job access tokens in the [Access repositories, artifacts, and other resources documentation](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/access-tokens?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic&preserve-view=true).
