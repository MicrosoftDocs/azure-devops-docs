### Improvement to user interface

Azure Artifacts (Feeds Experience) user interface (UI) now supports Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, the latest accessibility recommendations from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This aligns with Microsoftâ€™s goal to make products and services accessible to everyone.   

Azure Artifacts have several improvements with the new UI and with this release, several accessibility compliance updates have been done for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, including core shell and page support for zoom up to 400%, improved progressive collapse, and keyboard support access. 

As always, we want our Artifact Services to meet the evolving needs of our community. Post a comment or use the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/22/tfs.html?type=idea) to provide feedback.
