### New user interface for upstream package search

Previously, you could see upstream packages if you had a copy of the feed. The pain-point was that you couldn't search for packages that are available in the upstream and that are not yet saved in the feed. Now, you can search for available upstream packages with the new feed user interface.

Azure Artifacts now provide a user interface that allows you to search for packages in your upstream sources and save packages versions into your feed. This aligns with Microsoftâ€™s goal to improve our products and services.

As always, we want our Artifact Services to meet the evolving needs of our community. Post a comment or use the [Developer community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/22/tfs.html?type=idea) to provide feedback.
