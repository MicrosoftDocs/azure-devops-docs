# Azure Boards and Azure Pipelines GitHub Integration Improvements - Sprint 149 Update

In the **Sprint 149 Update** of Azure DevOps, we added the ability to navigate to Azure Boards directly from mentions in a GitHub comment as well as support for Azure Boards in GitHub Enterprise.  

For Azure Pipelines we enabled a new feature on GitHub pull requests that lets you run optional checks by mentioning /azp in the comment.  You can also require a comment on the pull request from a repository contributor before the pipeline will run giving you the ability to review code from unknown users before building it.
