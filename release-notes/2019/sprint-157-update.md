#  Rollup on backlogs and Azure App Service deployment improvements - Sprint 157 Update

In the **Sprint 157 Update** of Azure DevOps, we added rollup columns to backlogs that let you track progress across work item hierarchies (e.g. Epics/Features/User Stories). We also added multiple improvements for deploying Azure App Service apps.
