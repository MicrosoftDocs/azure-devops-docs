#  Use GitHub Actions to trigger a run in Azure Pipelines - Sprint 161 Update

In the **Sprint 161 Update** of Azure DevOps, we are excited to announce [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for Azure Pipelines. With GitHub Actions, you can trigger an Azure Pipelines run directly from your GitHub Actions workflow.
