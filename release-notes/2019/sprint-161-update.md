#  Use GitHub Actions to trigger a run in Azure Pipelines - Sprint 161 Update

In the **Sprint 161 Update** of Azure DevOps, we are excited to announce [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for Azure Pipelines. With GitHub Actions, you can trigger an Azure Pipelines run directly from your GitHub Actions workflow. We've also added support for multiple repositories in Azure Pipelines so you can fetch and checkout other repositories in addition to the one you use to store your YAML pipeline.

Check out the [Features](#features) list below for more.
