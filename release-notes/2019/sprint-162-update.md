#  Create a dashboard without a team - Sprint 162 Update

In the **Sprint 162 Update** of Azure DevOps, we are excited to announce that you can create a dashboard without associating it to a team. The dashboard will be visible to everyone in the project and you can decide who can edit/manage it.

In addition, we've added the sprint burndown thumbnail. Now you can configure it to burndown based on stories, story points, or by count of tasks.
