# New Azure Pipelines App for Teams, improved GitHub and Azure Boards integration - Sprint 151 Update

In the **Sprint 151 Update** of Azure DevOps, we improved the GitHub integration with Azure Boards by adding a GitHub Marketplace app to streamline the acquisition and configuration with your GitHub repositories. 
In addition, you can now link work items in Azure Boards with related issues in GitHub. For example, you can accept bug reports from your users in GitHub while organizing your team's work in Azure Boards.

In addition, we added a new Azure Pipelines app for Microsoft Teams that allows you to easily monitor and manage your pipelines from Teams.
