# Manage organization billing in Azure DevOps - Sprint 150 Update

In the **Sprint 150 Update** of Azure DevOps, we added the ability to manage billing for your organization within our portal.

From the new billing tab you can choose the Azure subscription you use for billing, and pay for additional users. You no longer need to go to the Visual Studio Marketplace or the Azure portal to manage billing.
