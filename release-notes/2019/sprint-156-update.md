#  Enhancements to Azure Boards - Sprint 156 Update

In the **Sprint 156 Update** of Azure DevOps, we continue to improve Azure Boards to include items that can help enhance the user's experience. For instance, you can now **customize system picklist values** such as Severity, Activity and Priority. In addition, we added rule support for setting fields to read-only or required based on group membership. Finally, we created a new extension to allow you to create [cascading picklists](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.cascading-picklists-extension) on your work item form.
