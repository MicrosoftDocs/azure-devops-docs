### Build failure and duration reports

It is important to have metrics and insights to continuously improve the throughput and stability of your pipeline. As the first step towards providing you with pipeline analytics, we added two reports to give you metrics and insights about your pipelines.  

1. The failure report will show the build pass rate and the failure trend. In addition, it will also show the tasks failure trend to provide insights on which task is contributing to the maximum number of failures.

2. The duration report will have the pipeline duration along with its trend.

We will also continue to offer [Power BI integration through analytics views](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/report/powerbi/index?view=azure-devops) and direct access to our [OData endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/report/extend-analytics/index?view=azure-devops) in preview for all Azure DevOps Services customers.

If you are using the Analytics marketplace extension, you can continue to use Analytics as you did before and do not need to follow any additional steps. This means that we will deprecate the [Analytics marketplace extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vss-analytics) for hosted customers.

The Azure DevOps Analytics offering is the future of reporting and we will continue to invest in new features driven by Analytics. You can find more information about Analytics in the links below.
