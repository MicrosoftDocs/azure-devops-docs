### Lead and Cycle Time widgets advanced filtering

[Lead and cycle time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/dashboards/cycle-time-and-lead-time?view=azure-devops) are used by teams to see how long it takes for work to flow through their development pipelines, and ultimately deliver value to their customers. 

Until now, the [lead and cycle time widgets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/dashboards/cycle-time-and-lead-time?view=azure-devops#configure-the-cycle-time-and-lead-time-widgets) did not support advanced filter criteria to ask questions such as: "how long is it taking my team to close out the higher priority items?" 

With this update questions like this can be answered by filtering on the Board swimlane.

We've also included work item filters in order to limit the work items that appear in the chart.
