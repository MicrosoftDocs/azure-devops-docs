### Improvement to the Query Results widget

The [query results widget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/report/dashboards/widget-catalog?view=azure-devops#query-results-widget) is one of our most popular widgets, and for good reason. The widget displays the results of a query directly on your dashboard and is useful in many situations.

With this update we included many long-awaited improvements:

* You can now select as many columns as you want to display in the widget. **No more 5-column limit!**
* The widget **supports all sizes**, from 1x1 to 10x10. 
* When you resize a column, **the column width will be saved**. 
* You can **expand the widget to full screen view**. When expanded, it will display all the columns returned by the query.
