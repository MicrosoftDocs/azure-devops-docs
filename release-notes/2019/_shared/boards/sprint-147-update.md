### Show work item status in #ID mentions

In order to enhance the work item mentioning experience, weâ€™ve added more information when you link a work item using #ID. You will now see in the discussion section the status of the work item you linked in addition to the ID, title, and work item type.

This experience can also be used in Wiki pages as described [here](/azure/devops/release-notes/2019/wiki/sprint-147-update#show-work-item-status-in-wiki-pages), as well as in pull request comments. For more details, see the documentation on using #ID to link to work items [here](/azure/devops/notifications/add-links-to-work-items).
