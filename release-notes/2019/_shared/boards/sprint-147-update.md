### Show work item status in #ID mentions

In order to enhance the work item mentioning experience, we’ve added more information when you link a work item using #ID. You will now see in the discussion section the status of the work item you linked in addition to the ID, title, and work item type.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

This experience can also be used in Wiki pages as described [here](#show-work-item-status-in-wiki-pages), as well as in pull request comments. For more details, see the documentation on using #ID to link to work items [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/notifications/add-links-to-work-items?view=azure-devops).
