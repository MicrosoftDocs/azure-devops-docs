The three sections of the report include the following:  
1. **Summary**: shows a consolidated view for the selected test plans. 
2. **Outcome trend**: renders a daily snapshot to give you an execution and status trendline. It can show data for 14 days (default), 30 days, or a custom range. 
3. **Details**: this section lets you drill down by each test plan and gives you important analytics for each test suite.
