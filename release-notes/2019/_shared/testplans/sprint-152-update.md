### Share test run results via URL 

You can configure automated tests to run as part of a build or release. The published test results can be viewed in the **Tests** tab in build or release summary. With this update, we added a **Copy results URL** feature so you can share a single test run results with others in your team. 

The sharing levels include:
  * Run level
  * Result level
  * Individual tab selected within test run 
  * Sharing is also compatible with any extension tabs configured

When you share the URL, viewers will see the test run results in the full screen view.
