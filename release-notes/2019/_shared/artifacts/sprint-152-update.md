### Manage artifacts in a pipeline run from the command line

If you need to download a set of artifacts generated by a pipeline, you can now download, upload or list the artifacts generated by a particular pipeline run from a command line using the `az pipelines runs` command. 

For more details on the command and its syntax, see the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/pipelines/runs/artifact?view=azure-cli-latest).
