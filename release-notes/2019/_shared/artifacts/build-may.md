### Pay-per-GB

Until now, a separate, additional license was required for anyone using Azure Artifacts, beyond the Azure DevOps basic license. We heard your feedback that this was inflexible, hard to manage, and often not cost-effective. Based on this feedback, we've changed how we charge for Azure Artifacts. Now, we will only charge for the storage you use, not the number of people who use it. This way every user in your organization can access and share packages.

Every organization can use up to 2 GB storage for free. Additional storage usage is charged according to tiered rates starting at $2 per GB and decreasing to $0.25 per GB. Full details can be found on [our pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/).

### General availability of Python and Universal Packages

We've had support for [Python packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/artifacts/quickstarts/python-packages), as well as our own [Universal Packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/artifacts/quickstarts/universal-packages), in public preview for some time. Starting now, both are generally available and ready for all your production workloads.
