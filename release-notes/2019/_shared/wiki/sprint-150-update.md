### Notifications on wiki pages

Until now, you didn't have a way of knowing when the content on a  wiki page was changed. Now you can follow wiki pages to get notified via email when the page is edited, deleted or renamed. To track changes made to a wiki, select the **Follow** button from the wiki page.
