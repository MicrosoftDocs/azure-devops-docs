### Search for wiki pages across organizations
 
You can now search for wiki pages across organizations, without navigating to a different organization, using the **Search within** drop-down on wiki search. The **Search within** drop-down provides a list of all organizations you have access to with the number of hits per organization for the search term. You can use this to navigate through search results from different organization quickly and easily.
