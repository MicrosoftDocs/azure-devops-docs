### Top publisher certification program

We have created a Top Publisher program in the Marketplace to help you evaluate or acquire Azure DevOps extensions/integrations with confidence. The Top Publisher badge implies that the publisher has shown commitment to their customers and the Marketplace through exemplary policies, quality, reliability, and support. Marketplace assigns the badge to a publisher after carefully reviewing the publisher across a variety of parameters. Read about them [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/marketplace/trust?view=azure-devops#top-publisher) and check out the offerings from the [Top Publishers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=AzureDevOps&category=All%20categories&certified=certifiedpublishers&sortBy=Downloads).
