### Azure DevOps CLI extension

We're excited to announce the public preview of the Azure DevOps extension for the Azure CLI.  This extension is available across platforms and allows you to experience Azure DevOps from the command line, bringing the capability to manage Azure DevOps right to your fingertips. You can now work in a streamlined task/command-oriented way without having to worry about the GUI flows hence making your interactions flexible and faster.

For more details on the commands that are supported, take a look at the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/?view=azure-cli-latest).

If you have any suggestions for new features or improvements, we’d love your feedback in the [Azure DevOps Extension for Azure CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-cli-extension) repo – we’re taking PR’s!
