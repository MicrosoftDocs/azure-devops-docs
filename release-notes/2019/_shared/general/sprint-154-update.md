### Azure DevOps CLI general availability 

In February, we introduced the Azure DevOps extension for Azure CLI. The extension lets you interact with Azure DevOps from the command line. We've collected your feedback that helped us improve the extension and add more commands. We are now happy to announce that the extension is generally available. 

To learn more about Azure DevOps CLI, see the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/cli/index?view=azure-devops).
