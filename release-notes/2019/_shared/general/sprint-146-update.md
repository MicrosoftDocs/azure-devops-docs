### Restore deleted projects

In this update, we added the ability to restore deleted projects from the Azure DevOps portal. If you have “delete project” permission you can also restore a deleted project from the **Organization Settings > Overview Page**. For step by step guidance, view the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/projects/restore-project?view=azure-devops).
