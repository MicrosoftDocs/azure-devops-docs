### New UI to request access to an organization

You can now request access to an organization with the new **request access UI**. If you belong to the same tenant as the Azure DevOps organization that you need access to, the new request access UI will let you notify the administrators of the organization with a justification for why you need access. The administrator(s) will receive an email notification from Azure DevOps with the details of the request. Details will include: email ID of the requestor, target organization name and justification.
