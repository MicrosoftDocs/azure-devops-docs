### Proximity support for code search

As we listened to your feedback from the [Developer Community]((https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/idea/474980/support-of-proximity-search-terms-near-before-afte.html)), we heard that you wanted proximity code search support. You can now use **NEAR**, **BEFORE** and **AFTER** operators to find files based on the term distance. For example, if you search for *foo NEAR bar* it will return all files where *foo* is in proximity to the term *bar*. 

To learn more about code search, see the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/search/advanced-code-search-syntax?view=azure-devops#search-for-special-characters).
