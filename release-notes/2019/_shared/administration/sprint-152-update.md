### Manage users from the command line

As an administrator, you may need to have a standard process to manage users. Currently, you have to repeat the same steps to add a new user and add the user to a license. This process can become tedious and error prone. Now you can use Azure DevOps CLI to create a standard script to enlist, add, and update a user and repeat the steps by just running this script. 

For more details on the commands and the syntax, see the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/devops/user?view=azure-cli-latest).
