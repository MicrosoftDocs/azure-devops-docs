### A simpler way to buy Azure DevOps

We are constantly working to improve our end-to-end experience, including how you purchase our product. In response to your feedback, we are pleased to announce changes that will simplify how you purchase some of Azure DevOps services. Weâ€™ll be rolling out the Azure Artifacts changes on May 6, 2019 and the other licensing changes will be reflected on your bill from June 1, 2019 on.

Take a look at the blog post with the full announcement [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/a-simpler-way-to-buy-azure-devops/).
