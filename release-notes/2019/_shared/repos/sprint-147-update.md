### View just the left or right file in a pull request

Today, when viewing file changes in a pull request, you can use either a **Side-by-side diff** or **Inline diff** mode. We have received feedback that many of you just want to see the original file or the changed file, without comparing them. So we added a new option that will allow you to view either the left file or the right file individually.
