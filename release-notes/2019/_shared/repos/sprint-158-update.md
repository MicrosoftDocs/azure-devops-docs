### Use service account-based authentication to connect to AKS

Previously, when configuring Azure Pipelines from the AKS Deployment Center, we used an Azure Resource Manager Connection. This connection had access to the entire cluster and not just the namespace for which the pipeline was configured.

This feature was prioritized based on a [suggestion from the Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/idea/365841/add-git-pre-receive-hooks.html) to deliver a similar experience. We will continue to keep the ticket open and encourage users to tell us what other types of push policies you'd like to see.
