### Go get command support in Azure Repos 

Go is an open source programming language, also referred to as Golang. In Go, you can use the **get command** to download and install packages and dependencies. With this update, we've added support for `go get` within an Azure DevOps repository. With `go get`, you will be able to download packages with their dependencies named by the import paths. You can use the `import` key word to specify the import path.
