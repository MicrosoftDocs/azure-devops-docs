### Deploy your local Git web apps for Windows, Linux and Containers to Azure

With this update we added a few enhancements to the **Deployment Center** workflow for Azure. Now you can deploy your web apps for Windows, Linux and Containers from your local Git repository to these Azure Resources using Azure Pipelines. When you create the Azure Pipeline in the Deployment Center, an Azure Pipeline will get triggered for your local repo with every code commit.

### New Azure subscription option in Kubernetes service connection

Service connections for builds and releases allow you to connect to external and remote services to execute tasks for a build or deployment. You can [define and manage a service connection](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops#create-a-service-connection) from the Admin settings of your project.

With this update, we added an authentication option to the Kubernetes service connection form. Now you can select **Azure Subscription** to authenticate your connection. This makes it easy to deploy to specific namespaces by setting up Kubernetes connections with your Azure subscription and cluster name.

For a role-based access control (RBAC) enabled cluster, [ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) and [RoleBinding](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#rolebinding-and-clusterrolebinding) objects are created in the chosen namespace. The RoleBinding object limits the operations of the created service account only to the chosen namespace. For an RBAC disabled cluster, the service account created has cluster-wide permissions across namespaces.

### Notifications on failure of a release creation request

You can set notifications to receive emails as changes occur to your builds, code base, and other operations. For example, you can set an alert to get notified when a work item is assigned to you.

With this update, we added a new notification subscription to the **Release** category. This notification will send you an email when a request for a release creation fails. An example scenario where this may be useful is when a request to create a release fails because an artifact version is not available.
To learn how to manage your notifications see the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/notifications/howto-manage-personal-notifications?view=azure-devops).

### Azure Pipelines app for Slack

Users of Azure Pipelines and Slack can now use the Azure Pipelines app for Slack to easily monitor their pipelines. You can set up and manage subscriptions for completed builds, releases, pending approvals and more from the app and get notifications for these events in your Slack channels.

See the full announcement and instructions [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/announcing-launch-of-azure-pipelines-app-for-slack/).

### Skip continuous integration (CI) for a commit

Previously, you didn't have the option to use `[skip ci]` to skip a build when using the Azure Pipeline GitHub app. You can now tell Azure Pipelines to ignore a commit and skip running a pipeline that the commit would normally trigger. Just include `[skip ci]` in the commit message of the HEAD commit and Azure Pipelines will skip CI. You can also use any of the variations listed below. This is supported for commits to Azure Repos Git, Bitbucket Cloud, GitHub, and GitHub Enterprise Server.

- `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]`
- `skip-checks: true` or `skip-checks:true`
- `[skip azurepipelines]` or `[azurepipelines skip]`
- `[skip azpipelines]` or `[azpipelines skip]`
- `[skip azp]` or `[azp skip]`
- `***NO_CI***`

### Updates to hosted pipelines images

We're excited to announce that we've added a new VM image that you can use with your Hosted Pipelines. This image is based on Windows Server 2019 and comes with the Visual Studio 2019 Preview installed. It also carries over most of the tools from our Visual Studio 2017 image.

In addition, we've made updates to the Azure Pipelines hosted images. The following images were changed as part of this update:
* VS2017
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Windows Container 1803

For more details on the tools and versions available on our image content, visit our image generation repo on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-image-generation).

### Contribution point for variables in the create release dialog

Previously, the variables values needed during release creation had to be entered by the user without any assistance or suggestions. We've added contribution points to the **Create a new release** dialog to support extensions that will help populate the value of a variable during the release creation.

### Support for Python Function Apps in DevOps projects

[Azure DevOps Projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops-project/) provide an easy way to start running your applications in Azure. Until now, you only had the option to create a Windows Web App or Web App for Containers when adding a service for a Python application. With this update, we added support for a Function App. This will give you the flexibility to develop, deploy and monitor your Python Function App in Azure.

### Schedule releases on source or pipeline change

Previously, when you had a scheduled release trigger, a release would get triggered even when there wasn't any change detected in the upstream artifact or in the release definition. An option has been added to the **Schedule release trigger** panel to schedule releases only if the artifact version or the release definition changed.

### Build and release log viewer enhancements

We are rolling out enhancements to the log viewer for build and release. With this update, we are including the following changes:
  * Do not show timestamps on every line of log, hence making it easy to parse the logs.
  * Better support for ANSI color codes and special characters.

### Publish to Azure Service Bus session queues

We've extended the **Agentless job** build task to include the ability to publish messages to session queues. This option has been added to the **Publish to Azure Service Bus** task.

### Search by folder name in release definitions

You can organize your release definitions by storing them in folders. Previously, you didn't have the option to do a search by folder. It was challenging to find a specific release definition if you had created a lot of folders. Now you can search by folder name in the release definition making it easier to find the definitions you are looking for.

### Simplified publishing of test results

We've simplified the publishing of test results in pipelines by parsing the error log generated during the build operation and checking for signs of test failures. With this update, you can start using test reporting in Azure DevOps without additional configuration.
By default, your pipeline will infer the test output for a few popular test runners. 

Currently, the following languages and test runners are supported:
* Javascript - Mocha
* Javascript - Jest
* Javascript - Jasmine
* Python - Unittest


> [!NOTE] 
> The test report is a preview of the full test report and Insights experience. The following features are not available at this time:
> * Associate a test failure with a new bug or see a list of associated work items for the failure.
> * Group the test results by test file, owner, priority etc.
> * Search and filter the test results.
> * Preview attachments generated during the test runs in the web UI.

For more details on analyzing test results see the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/test/test-analytics?view=azure-devops).

### Azure Active Directory device code authentication flow for pipelines agent

We've added support for [Azure Active Directory Device Code Flow](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Device-Code-Flow) to the pipelines agent. Previously you had to set up a PAT manually for a one-time setup. Now you can use your web browser to easily create a PAT.
When you run the agent configuration script, enter "AAD" for authentication type. The script will guide you through the next steps, including where to go on the web and what code to enter.

### Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6

With this update, we added agent support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. You can now configure agents targeting the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 platform for build and release jobs execution.
