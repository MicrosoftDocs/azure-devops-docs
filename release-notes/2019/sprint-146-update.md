# GitHub Enterprise support and automatic GitHub service connections in build pipelines - Sprint 146 Update

In the **Sprint 146 Update** of Azure DevOps, we improved our GitHub integration with Azure Pipelines. The New build pipeline wizard can now create pipelines for **GitHub Enterprise** repositories. It also analyzes your repository to provide a suggested language template. In addition, it can create and re-use service connections for the GitHub repositories you select.
