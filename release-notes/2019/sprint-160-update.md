#  New sprint burndown widget and improved pipelines security - Sprint 160 Update

In the **Sprint 160 Update** of Azure DevOps, we added a new sprint burndown widget that supports burning down by story points, count of tasks and by summing custom fields. In addition, we improved pipelines security by restricting the scope of access tokens.
