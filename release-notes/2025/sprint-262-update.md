# Azure Boards integration with GitHub Copilot private preview

We’re thrilled to introduce a new capability in our Azure Boards and GitHub integration. You can now connect Azure Boards work items with the GitHub Copilot coding agent, now available in private preview. This feature will let Azure DevOps users to create work items, add detailed instructions in the description, and seamlessly send them to Copilot. The coding agent can then tackle a range of engineering tasks—such as bug fixes, incremental feature development, test coverage improvements, documentation updates, and technical debt remediation.
