# Private preview of Azure Boards integration with GitHub Copilot

We’re thrilled to introduce a new capability in our Azure Boards and GitHub integration. You can now connect  work items with the GitHub Copilot coding agent. This feature will let you create work items, add detailed instructions in the description, and seamlessly send them to Copilot. The coding agent can then tackle a range of engineering tasks such as bug fixes, incremental feature development, test coverage improvements, documentation updates, and technical debt remediation.

Check out the release notes for details.
