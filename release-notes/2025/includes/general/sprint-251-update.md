### Removal of Generate Git Credentials button in Repos and Wiki

The **Generate Git Credentials** button has been removed from the **Clone Repository** dialogs in the Repos and Wiki UI to support the transition to Microsoft Entra tokens for authentication in Git operations. Previously, selecting this button generated a new Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `vso.code` scope, active for seven days. Each use created a new PAT, often resulting in unnecessary credentials.

To enhance security and streamline authentication, consider using Entra tokens for ad-hoc Git clone operations in Repos and Wiki. Documentation is available to help you configure authentication via the  [command line](/azure/devops/repos/git/auth-overview?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows) or within the [Git Credential Manager](/azure/devops/repos/git/set-up-credential-managers?view=azure-devops) (GCM).

While PATs remain available for Git operations, they must now be manually created with the appropriate `vso.code` scope from the Personal Access Token page. Ensure that PATs are only active as long as needed and revoked when no longer in use. As a best practice, store PATs securely in a secret management service such as Azure Key Vault (AKV) and rotate them regularly.
