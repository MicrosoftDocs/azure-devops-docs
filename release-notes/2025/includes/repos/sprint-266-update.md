### Disabling the save operation for obsolete TFVC policies

As previously outlined in our plan published on the [DevOps Blog](https://aka.ms/tfvc-policy-blogpost), we are disabling the creation and modification of obsolete TFVC policies as part of a phased deprecation. Existing obsolete policies remain available for use and viewing in their current state. We recommend migrating to the new policy type before the next phase of this process begins.

For questions or feedback, please reach out via the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/AzureDevOps/suggest).
