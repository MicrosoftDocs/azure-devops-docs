### Disabling the Save Operation for Obsolete TFVC Policies

As outlined in our plan published on the [DevOps Blog](https://aka.ms/tfvc-policy-blogpost), we are disabling the creation and updating of obsolete TFVC policies as part of a phased removal process. Existing obsolete policies can still be viewed and used in their current state, but we recommend migrating to the new policy type before the next phase begins.

If you have any questions, please use [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Custom-check-in-policy-migration-plan).
