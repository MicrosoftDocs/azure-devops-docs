### GitHub Advanced Security is now available as GitHub Secret Protection and Code Security for Azure DevOps 

GitHub Secret Protection and GitHub Code Security can now be purchased as standalone products on Azure DevOps for new customers.

Secret Protection provides access to secret scanning, push protection, and security overview experiences. Code Security provides access to all dependency scanning, code scanning, and security overview experiences.

All existing Advanced Security customers can continue using the bundled product experience without disruptions. If you're a current Advanced Security customer and interested in switching to the standalone products, contact Azure DevOps support via the Azure Portal. You can file a support ticket for the GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps service and select `Billing migration from bundled to standalone products` as the problem type.
