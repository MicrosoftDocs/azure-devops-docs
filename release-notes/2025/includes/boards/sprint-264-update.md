### Azure DevOps local MCP Server generally available

The **local MCP Server for Azure DevOps** is now generally available, moving out of public preview with several key improvements based on community feedback. This release delivers enhanced login and authorization, new and refined tools, and introduces “domains” to help scope tools and manage client limits. 

The Azure DevOps MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI assistants like GitHub Copilot and Azure DevOps, allowing users to securely access and interact with work items, wikis, test plans, and more within their own environment. 

Ready to get started? Visit the [Azure DevOps MCP Server repository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp) for installation instructions, examples, and contribution guidelines.
