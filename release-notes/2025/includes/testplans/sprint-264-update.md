### Focused test point history panel

Previously, you had no easy way to see point-specific history from the Test Plan page, making it hard to differentiate among test points in result history:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of associate test from pipeline run.](../../media/264-testplans-01.png "Screenshot of associate test from pipeline run.")](../../media/264-testplans-01.png#lightbox)

Now you can view execution history for individual test points directly from the Test Plan page:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of associate test from pipeline run.](../../media/264-testplans-02.png "Screenshot of associate test from pipeline run.")](../../media/264-testplans-02.png#lightbox)
