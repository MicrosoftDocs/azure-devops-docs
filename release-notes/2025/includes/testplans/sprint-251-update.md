### Azure Test Plans bug fixes

With this sprint, we’ve made updates to Azure Test Plans to resolve several bugs and improve usability. Here’s what’s been fixed:

* **Shared step results vow visible:**
    Fixed a bug where shared step results wouldn’t appear in the query editor when accessing test cases in the New Boards Hub.

* **Improved stakeholder mode sessions:**
    Resolved an issue in the test and feedback extension that blocked users with stakeholder access from starting sessions. 
* **Cleaner test plan copying:**
    Fixed a problem where requirements were duplicated when copying a Test Plan using the “Reference Existing Test Cases” option.
