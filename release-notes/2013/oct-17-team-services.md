#Team Foundation Service updates - Oct 17

##Build Image Update

Today we interrupt our normally scheduled 3 week update cadence with a bonus update to the service.

It’s a big day for Microsoft platforms with the launch of Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Visual Studio 2013. As a result we have refreshed our build machine image. It now includes Visual Studio 2013 RTM.

In the next sprint deployment which is upcoming shortly, we will be updating the operating system on the build machine image to Windows Server 2012 R2. This will enable folks to build Windows 8.1 apps using the cloud build service.

As always let us know how we're doing on [User Voice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/330519-vso), the [MSDN Forums](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/TFService/threads), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tfservice).

Thanks,

Jamie Cool
