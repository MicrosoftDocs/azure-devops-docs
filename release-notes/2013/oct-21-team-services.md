# Team Foundation Service updates - Oct 21

## Account and project pages

Our account and project pages received a long overdue face lift today. We’ve known for some time that these pages needed some attention and I’m happy to announce that the new bits rolled out to the service this morning. You’ll notice that the new design is more visually appealing and makes better use of screen real estate on wider resolutions. We also took the time to incorporate our news feed directly into your account home page so you stay up to date on the latest updates being made to the service.

## Remembering your last team room

Finally, we did a bit of work to ensure that the Rooms hub now remembers the last team room you visited and takes you directly there.

## Updated Build Image

We also updated the build image operating system to Windows Server 2012 R2. This enables you to use the hosted build controller for Windows 8.1 apps.

That’s it for sprint 55. As always let us know how we're doing on [User Voice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/330519-vso), the [MSDN Forums](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/TFService/threads), and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23tfservice).

Thanks,

Aaron Bjork
