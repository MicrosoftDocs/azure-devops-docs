# Team Foundation Service updates - Jan 21

## Explore and Compare

Just one small update for everyone in this sprint. In our continued effort to improve the web based version control experience we added some handy new functionality to changesets. You’ll now see a dropdown menu next to each file in a changeset. Clicking the dropdown provides a few new options including comparing to either the previous version or latest version, downloading the file, and exploring the source tree as of this version.

That’s it for this sprint.

As always, let us know how we’re doing on [User Voice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/330519-vso), the [MSDN Forums](http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/TFService/threads), and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23tfservice).

Thanks,

Aaron Bjork
