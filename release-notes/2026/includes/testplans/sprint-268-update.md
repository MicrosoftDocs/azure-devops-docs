### New Test Case Import 
The new and improved Test Case Import Wizard to boost your productivity is now available. It comes with advanced auto-mapping capabilities, mapping templates to share with your team, and more. Check the public documentation for more information [here](/azure/devops/test/bulk-import-export-test-cases?view=azure-devops#import-test-cases).

Focused Test Point History Panel


So far, you had no easy way to see point-specific history from the Test Plan page, making it hard to differentiate among test points in result history:

Now you can view execution history for individual test points directly from the Test Plan page:

And when needed click on the view all history, to review the full execution history of the test case too.
