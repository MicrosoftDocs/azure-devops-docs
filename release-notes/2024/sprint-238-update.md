# Simplifying Code Security Integration with Third-Party Providers

As we continue our integration with GitHub Advanced Security, we are excited to announce that you can now leverage the publish task (AdvancedSecurity-Publish@1) to import security results from third-party providers into the Advanced Security Code Scanning alerts hub. This update supports SARIF 2.1, enabling a comprehensive view of security alerts across various analysis tools directly within Azure DevOps, simplifying the management of code security.
