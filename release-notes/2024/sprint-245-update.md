# Enhanced AB# link tracking in GitHub pull requests

With this update, AB# links now appear directly in the Development section of GitHub pull requests, as long as they are included in the pull request description. This enhancement simplifies access to linked work items through the Azure Boards and GitHub integration.

We’re also excited to introduce enhanced monitoring tools, offering greater visibility into your repository’s health and helping you maintain its performance more efficiently!

Check out the release notes for details.
