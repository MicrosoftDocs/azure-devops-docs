### Code Coverage results for folders

Results for code coverage are now available for every individual file and folder rather than only as a top-level number. The code coverage view appears when the ***Folder view mode*** button is toggled. In this mode you can drill down and see the code coverage for that selected subtree. Use the toggle button to switch between the new and old views.
