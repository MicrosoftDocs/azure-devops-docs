### Improve search results with Wildcard Prefixes and Substrings

We’re excited to announce our new search feature, which now supports wildcard as prefix and substring searches across code, work items, wiki, and packages. By adding a wildcard at the beginning and end of your search term, you can find all relevant strings that contain your term. For instance, entering 'test' in the search box yields results like 'mytestclass', 'improvecodewithtest', and 'test_wikiarticle'. This feature will rollout over the next few weeks.
