# Support Pipelines App with GitHub Enterprise Cloud

The integration between Azure Pipelines and GitHub is facilitated by a [GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines). This app makes it easy to set up pipelines for a GitHub repository and to deliver events (CI, PR, Comment, etc) from GitHub to Azure Pipelines. The app also enhances the security of pull requests using [comment triggers](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines).

However, this app does not work when using Azure Pipelines with GitHub Enterprise Cloud. The goal of this work is to fix that.
