# Report stage status to work item when using a YAML release pipeline with GitHub repository

Similar to how classic release pipelines report deployment status, extend support for YAML pipelines to display stage status on the **Deployments** control within the work item form when your code resides in a GitHub repository.

Depends on [**Report YAML stage status to Deployment control on work item**](boards-yaml-stage-status-on-work-item.md).
