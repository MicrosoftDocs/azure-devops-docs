# Workload identity federation Azure DevOps issuer retirement

With the introduction of the [Entra issuer for workload identity federation](/azure/devops/release-notes/roadmap/2025/proof-of-possession/workload-identity-federation), new service connections are no longer created with the Azure DevOps issuer. We will announce retirement of this issuer and deprecate existing service connection using it at some point in the future.
