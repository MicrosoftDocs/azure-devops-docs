# Recycle bin improvements

As a user with permanently delete work item permissions, I need to be able to:

- Search and find specific work items that have been deleted
- Select all work items in the recycle bin and permanently delete them
- Recycle bin actions and response times need to be fast

> [!NOTE]
> We have decided to forego implemention of this feature. Initially, we planned to revamp the recycle bin functionality in order to address performance concerns at scale with New Boards Hub. However, we were able to resolve these issues without the need for major changes. We will reassess the status of the recycle bin feature once the [New Boards Hub](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/new-boards-hub-public-preview/) is no longer in preview.
