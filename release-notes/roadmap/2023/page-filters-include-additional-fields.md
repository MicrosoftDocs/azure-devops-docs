# Additional fields on page filters

As a user, I want to filter work items by any field. Not just the few fields currently available. This applies for backlogs, boards, sprints, queries, and delivery plans.

[Community Suggestion Ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/add-the-ability-to-filter-boards-by-custom-fields/606538)

Dialog to pick and choose additional fields to be used on filter control.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![screen shot field picker.](media/boards-field-filters-1.gif#lightbox)

Additional fields added.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![screen shot new field filters applied.](media/boards-field-filters-2.gif#lightbox)

> [!NOTE]
> This feature will only be available with the [**New Boards Hubs** preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/new-boards-hub-public-preview/).
