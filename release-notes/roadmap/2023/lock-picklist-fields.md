# Lock picklist fields

As a process administrator, I want the ability to lock a picklist field from being edited across process templates. For example, I have a field with a set of values, and I don't want anyone to add or change those picklist values. The picklist values will be set by a process admin, then it should be locked to prevent editing. The field can then be added to any process, but the values cannot be changed.
