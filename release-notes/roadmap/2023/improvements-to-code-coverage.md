# Improvements to code coverage user experience in Pipeline results page

Customers can view code coverage information of their pipeline builds from the pipeline results page. This experience is surfaced to customers through a dedicated Code coverage tab within the results page. We are planning some major updates to the code coverage tab to help our customers drive more value. We are adding a new layer of experience to better inform customers of the various stages as their code coverage results get generated. We are also surfacing error messages more proactively to help customers debug issues in case of results generation failure.
