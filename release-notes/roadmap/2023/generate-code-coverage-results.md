# Generate code coverage results in source /folder level view

Customers can view their code coverage results in ‘Project’ view today. This informs them of the code coverage percentage of the various DLL files being tested. However, in the case of monolith repositories, customers can have multiple microservices under the same repository. Hence, customers are unable to quantify the code coverage of their individual microservices. Automated testing is solving this problem by showcasing code coverage insights at a source level. This will allow developers to better quantify the code coverage results of their microservices and take mitigation steps accordingly.
