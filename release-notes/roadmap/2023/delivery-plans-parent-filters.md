# Improvements to parent filters

As a user, I need a better experience in delivery plans to see all my work by one or more parents. I should be able to select multiple parent work items across all teams.

 Initial state, an empty "filter by parent" search box with no parent selected.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![screen shot 1 of new parent filters](media/boards-delivery-plans-parent-filters-1.png#lightbox)

See all available parents relative to the teams and backlog levels. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![screen shot 2 of new parent filters](media/boards-delivery-plans-parent-filters-2.png#lightbox)

 Once one or more parents are selected (filter is active), we show the checkbox asking if you want to see the hierarchy view. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![screen shot 3 of new parent filters](media/boards-delivery-plans-parent-filters-3.png#lightbox)

 Introduce a menu on the work items, that when clicked, will apply the parent filter across all teams.
