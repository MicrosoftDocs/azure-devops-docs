# New Boards Hub on by default

The [**New Boards Hub** preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/new-boards-hub-public-preview/) will now be the default experience for all users. You will have the ability to revert back to the old boards hub, for a short period of time, while we continue to collect and address feedback on New Boards Hub.
