# Improved support for viewing code coverage directly in Azure DevOps

Code coverage can be a tremendously useful tool for understanding how well your suite of automated tests is
covering your codebase. Unfortunately, code coverage results for automated tests run within Azure Pipelines
are not well supported across the wide variety of test runners and file formats in use today. We'll be 
improving support for publishing code coverage from a wider variety of sources and making the results
available directly within the Code Coverage tab in Azure Pipelines.
