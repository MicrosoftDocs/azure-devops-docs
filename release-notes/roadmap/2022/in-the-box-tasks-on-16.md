# All in-the-box tasks run on Node 16

Now that the [Node 16 task runner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/release-notes/2022/sprint-210-update#node-16-task-runner-in-pipeline-agent) is available, we are converting and testing each of our built-in tasks to run on the new task runner. You can track our updates to tasks in our [tasks repo](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks). We expect to update a few tasks every Sprint, and plan to finish the conversion of all Node tasks to Node 16 before the end of 2022. These changes will be seamless to you and you do not have to update any of your pipelines.
