# Checks extensibility

With classic release management, you can author [custom gates](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/blob/master/docs/authoring/gates.md) and publish them as an extension in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=gate&target=AzureDevOps&category=Azure%20Pipelines&sortBy=Relevance). The same is not possible with checks in YAML pipelines. While you can run custom logic in a check by writing your own [Azure function](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/approvals?view=azure-devops&tabs=check-pass#invoke-azure-function) or [REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/process/approvals?view=azure-devops&tabs=check-pass#invoke-rest-api) check, the experience is not as ideal as it would be with a custom check. We will bridge this gap and make checks extensible in Azure Pipelines.
