# Sort test plans by any column

The main Test Plans page in Azure DevOps supports marking individual test plans as favorites, filtering by various
fields, and even filtering based on keywords in test plan titles. But it does *not* support sorting the test plans
by anything other than the order in which they were created. We'll be adding the ability to sort ascending or 
descending by any column to give customers one more tool to find the test plans they are looking for in organizations
that have a bunch of them.
