# Workload identity federation using Entra-issued tokens

[Workload identity federation (WIF)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/workload-identity-federation-for-azure-deployments-is-now-generally-available/)â€¯enables deployment from Azure Pipelines to Azure without using secrets. The current implementation of WIF relies on an ID token issued by Azure DevOps, which is then exchanged for an Entra-issued access token. In the next revision, the ID token will also be issued by Entra instead of Azure DevOps. This change will enhance security by leveraging all the mechanisms available in Entra to protect the ID tokens. Once this feature is rolled out, all newly created service connections will use Entra-issued ID tokens. Additionally, you will have the option to convert your existing service connections to use the new scheme.
