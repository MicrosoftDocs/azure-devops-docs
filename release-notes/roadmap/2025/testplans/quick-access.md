# Quick access to test results and Run ID in web runner

This feature simplifies tracking and reviewing test run results by displaying the Run ID upfront and providing a direct path to your results. The Run ID now appears automatically when a test run starts in web runner, making it easier to reference and track. After completion, a dialog guides you straight to the results page, reducing the need to navigate through test plans or suites. These updates enhance traceability and efficiency, ensuring quick, seamless access to your test run information.
