# Undo test step in web and desktop runner

Take control of your test case run with the new "Undo" option. You can easily revert test step statuses with a simple double-click, giving you more flexibility and control during test runs. No more restarting test cases to fix accidental clicksâ€”just undo and continue your workflow without interruption. We are also introducing keyboard-friendly navigation and accessibility improvements to ensure this feature works seamlessly for all users, including those who rely on assistive technologies. This enhancement will help you save time, reduce frustration, and stay focused on running tests efficiently.
