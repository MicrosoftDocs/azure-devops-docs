# Resume paused test cases on by default

Quickly resume your paused test cases with a single click. We've made "Resume" the default action for paused test cases, allowing you to pick up right where you left off without extra navigation. This update makes it faster and easier to continue your work without interruption. To further protect your progress, we're introducing a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental overwrites of paused test progress. This safeguard ensures your partially saved work stays intact, giving you peace of mind while managing your test runs.
