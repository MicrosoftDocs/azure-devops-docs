# Support YAML pipelines in Azure Test Plans

Currently, it is possible to link automated tests to test cases and execute them from the Test Plans interface. Users need to select a build/release pipeline for execution. With the upcoming update, we will support the selection of YAML pipelines, in addition to the existing support for classic pipelines.
