# Seamless build pipeline integration for Test Case Run

Save time with automatic build pipeline configurations in the test web runner. With this new feature, build definitions and IDs set at the test plan level now automatically carry over to the test web runner, eliminating the need to manually configure them each time you run tests. This enhancement helps you streamline your test case run, ensuring that relevant build pipelines are ready to go and allowing you to focus on what matters mostâ€”executing tests efficiently.
