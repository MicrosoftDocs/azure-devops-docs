# New Test Run experience

Easily track test results across iterations with the revamped Test Run tab. We’re simplifying workflows and providing a more test run-centric view to help you track results more intuitively and improve traceability across test cycles. With this update, you’ll benefit from pipeline-based filtering, making it easier to connect test results to specific builds and artifacts. The new design ensures faster navigation, giving you quick access to key metrics without the need for tedious queries. These enhancements aim to make your test tracking process more seamless, allowing you to focus on your testing outcomes rather than navigating through complex workflows.
