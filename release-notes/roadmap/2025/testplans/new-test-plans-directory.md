# New Test Plans directory

Stay organized and save time with the New Test Plans Directory. We will introduce several enhancements to help you manage test plans more efficiently, giving you greater control over your workspace and reducing repetitive tasks. 

Here’s what’s will be included: 

* Cleaner UI Design: Navigate your test plans with ease using a modern interface that improves readability and reduces clutter, allowing you to focus on your tasks without distractions. 
* Column Sorting: Find what you need faster by sorting columns based on name, status, or other key attributes. This feature helps you quickly organize and prioritize your test plans for better productivity. 
* Team Filter in the "All" Tab: Focus on what matters by filtering test plans by team, ensuring you only see relevant plans that align with your work and goals. 
* Persistent Filters: Save time with persistent filters that remember your settings. When you return to the page, your previously applied filters will stay intact, providing an organized view without needing to reapply filters every time.

These updates are designed to streamline your workflow, reduce repetitive tasks, and make it easier to track and manage your test plans.
