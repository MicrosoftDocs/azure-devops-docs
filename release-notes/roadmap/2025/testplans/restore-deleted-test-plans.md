# Restore deleted test plans and test suites using REST API

Easily restore deleted test plans and test suites with new self-service APIs. We are introducing GET and PATCH APIs that allow you to look up deleted test plans or suites and restore them along with their child items—all without needing customer support. With these APIs, you can quickly recover accidentally deleted test work items, reducing downtime and improving productivity. While run artifacts won’t be restored, all related test plans, suites, and test cases can be brought back to your workspace with ease. This self-service feature gives you greater control over test management and streamlines the restoration process, making it faster and more efficient to recover critical test assets.
