# Streamlining bulk enablement scenarios

Enabling Advanced Security at scale has previously been a piecemeal approach. Changes will be coming to Coverage of the security overview page to enable greater monitoring of feature enablement across your organization. We will also be adding the ability to enable more features at the organization and project-level, such as push protection, dependency scanning auto-injection, and CodeQL one-click enablement when it’s available.
