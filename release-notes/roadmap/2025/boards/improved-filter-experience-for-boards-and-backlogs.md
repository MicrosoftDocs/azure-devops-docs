# Improved Filtering Experience for Boards and Backlogs

We are improving the filtering experience for boards and backlogs. Soon, these enhancements will also be available for queries and sprints. You will be able to filter on more fields, including custom fields. Any field shown as a column in backlogs or displayed on cards in boards can be used in filters.

This update is based on a [popular suggestion](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/add-the-ability-to-filter-boards-by-custom-fields/606538) from our user community.
