# Improved Filtering Experience for Boards and Backlogs

We are enhancing the filtering experience for boards and backlogs, with plans to extend this improvement to queries and sprints as well. This update will allow filtering on a wider range of fields, including custom fields. Any field added as a column in backlogs or displayed on cards in boards will be available in the filter experience.

This improvement is based on a [highly voted suggestion](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/add-the-ability-to-filter-boards-by-custom-fields/606538) from our user community.
