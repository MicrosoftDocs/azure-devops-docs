# Planned scalability improvements when connecting to GitHub repositories

We are planning to improve scalability for organizations connecting a large number of GitHub repositories to Azure DevOps projects. The following enhancements are on our roadmap:

- Increase the maximum number of connected repositories to 5,000.
- Enhance the search and selection experience when connecting GitHub repositories.
- Optimize performance for searching and selecting repositories, commits, pull requests, and branches, even when connected to a high volume of GitHub repositories.

These improvements are subject to change.
