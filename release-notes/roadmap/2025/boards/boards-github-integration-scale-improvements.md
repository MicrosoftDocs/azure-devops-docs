# Planned scalability improvements for GitHub repository connections

We plan to enhance scalability for organizations that connect many GitHub repositories to Azure DevOps projects. The following improvements are on our roadmap:

- Raise the maximum number of connected repositories to 5,000.
- Improve the search and selection process for connecting GitHub repositories.
- Optimize performance for searching and selecting repositories, commits, pull requests, and branches, even with a high volume of connected GitHub repositories.

These planned improvements are subject to change.
