# Support for Cargo package manager for Rust

Azure Artifacts Packaging is focused on expanding support for additional protocols, beginning with support for the Cargo package manager for Rust. Azure Artifacts will enable developers to publish and download Cargo packages from public registries.

We will continue to invest in the security and reliability of the packaging platform, so we have the right infrastructure to support a broader range of protocols. In the next 6 to 12 months, we plan to add native support for additional protocols based on the prioritized asks from customers.
