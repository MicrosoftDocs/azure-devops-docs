# Status check policies for Advanced Security alerts

To help teams better manage security debt, we’re introducing status check policies you can set at the branch level to prevent developers from introducing new vulnerabilities. You can customize what status checks run against a pull request and warn or block if any high or critical vulnerabilities are detected.
