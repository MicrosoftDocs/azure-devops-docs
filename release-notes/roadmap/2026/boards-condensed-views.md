# Condensed view for Kanban and Sprint Boards

To better align with **Delivery Plans**, we are introducing a new condensed view for both Kanban and Sprint boards. This view displays cards in a more compact format by showing only the title, allowing teams to see more work items on the screen at once and quickly understand progress at a glance.
