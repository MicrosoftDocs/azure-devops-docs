# Remote Azure DevOps MCP Server

Provide a hosted, remote MCP Server that exposes a curated set of tools from the [local Azure DevOps MCP Server](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp). This initial release will focus on core platform capabilities along with the most commonly used work item tools, enabling customers to integrate with Azure DevOps without the need to run and manage a local MCP Server.
