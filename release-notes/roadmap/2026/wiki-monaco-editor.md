# Replace existing Wiki editor with Monaco Editor

We plan to replace the existing Wiki editor with the Monaco Editor.

The Monaco Editor is the browser-based code editor that powers Visual Studio Code, delivering a rich, language-aware editing experience directly in the browser. For Markdown editing, Monaco offers syntax highlighting, intelligent handling of lists and code blocks, advanced keyboard shortcuts, multi-cursor support, and robust performance with large documents. By treating Markdown as a structured format rather than plain text, it minimizes formatting errors and simplifies content creation and maintenance, while providing the familiar, polished editing experience users expect from modern development tools.
