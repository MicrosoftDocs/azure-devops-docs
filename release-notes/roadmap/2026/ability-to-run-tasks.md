# Ability to run tasks on supported Node versions only

If you want tasks to run only on a supported Node version, we are introducing a setting that, when enabled, will make any task requiring an unsupported Node version run on the latest available Node version instead. Please note that in this situation, the task might fail or behave unpredictably. 

More details on the setting will be shared at the time of the release Agent Packaged with Node 24 

We have released Agent that also contains Node 24. In the box tasks will be updated soon to support Node 24.
