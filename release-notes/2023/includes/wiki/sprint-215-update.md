### Support for subpages table

You can now add a table of content for subpages to your wiki pages. This table will have links to all subpages located under the page where the table of subpages is shown.

You can add the table of subpages either by inserting the special tag **[[\_TOSP_]]** manually or from **More options** as shown in the animated image below. Only the first **[[\_TOSP_]]** tag is used to create the table of sub pages.

This feature was prioritized based on the following community suggestion tickets:
* [Table of contents should consider subpages](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/table-of-contents-should-consider-subpages/366283) 
* [Wiki macro for displaying child pages](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/wiki-macro-for-displaying-child-pages/365789)
