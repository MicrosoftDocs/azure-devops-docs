### Analytics Views are now generally available

The **Analytics Views** feature has been in a preview state for an extended period of time. Today we are happy to announce that this feature is now generally available to all organizations. 

In the navigation, **Analytics views** moved from the **Overview** tab to the **Boards** tab.
