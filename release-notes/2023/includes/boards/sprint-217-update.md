### Interactive boards reports

Interactive reports, located in the Boards hub, have been accessible as a preview feature for several years. They replace the older Cumulative Flow Diagram, Velocity, and Sprint Burndown charts. In this sprint we are taking them out of preview and officially making them generally available.


To view these charts, click the **Analytics** tab location on the Kanban Board, Backlog, and Sprints pages.
