### Organization profile image

Weâ€™re excited to announce that you can change the profile image for your organization and replace the automatically generated image based on your organization name. This has been a top requested feature in the [developer community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Can-Not-update-Organization-Settings-Ove/1329561) and one which gives large customers more control over how their organizations are represented within their company.

Check out our [documentation](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-organization-image?view=azure-devops) to learn how to change your organization profile image.
