### License source column in user list export

The list of users in your organization can be [exported to a data file](/azure/devops/organizations/security/export-users-audit-log?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true ). If your organization uses [group rules](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/assign-access-levels-by-group-membership?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true ), an additional column that indicates whether a user is assigned an access level via a group rule or direct assignment is visible. The **License Source** column is now included in the data export too.
