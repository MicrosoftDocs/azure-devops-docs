# Change organization profile image

You can now replace the image that we automatically generate for your organization to include a preferred image. In addition, we added resolved work items as completed to the burndown and burnup charts. This will let you select if you want to include work items with resolved state as completed items to your burndown and burnup charts. 

In Pipelines, we made improvements to approvals and checks. Now, the pipeline run details page shows the latest checks log.
