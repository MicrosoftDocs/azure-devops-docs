# Support for subpages table in wiki

You can now add subpages table to your wiki pages so you can see the content and links. In Boards, you can now add colors to swimlane and lock custom fields from being edited. We also continue our investments in security and added a new PAT scope for managing pipeline authorization and approvals and checks. 

Check out the release notes for details.
